grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"The real joy of this movie doesn't lie in its fun special effects, its twisted, albiet cheerful view of the afterlife, or Michael Keaton's Robin Williams impressions, but in its witty send-up of the New York art scene. No community is so desperately in need of skewering but it's rarely done -- and even more rarely done well.Burton was kitschy before kitschy was cool and he figured out early on that Robert Goulet's best work would come in spoofing himself. The film is aging nicely and along with 'Ed Wood', it stands as the best example of Burton's whimsical, if slightly malevolent world view."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,3.0,"Okay, Tim Burton is genuine. He haunts you with his films a'la Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. But let me tell you a little something about Beetlejuice. Most of the plot just does pin-wheels over its own weird a** summery. A lot of this movie makes hardly NO sense. But thats not why I gave it such a crappy rating. The reason is really some of the dialogue is childish and unrealistic and mostly sounds forced. A lot of the special effects really got on my nerves and I dont care what year this movie was made in. Look at The Day The Earth Stood Still. 1950's, still excellent top-notch effects. Tim Burton has his unique way of showing us his visions with his own particular special effects, but I dont really go for half of it. Still, 3 stars is good considering........"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I loved the flavor of the bars!!! I really didn't expect them to be as good as they are!!! I have had other nutritional bars that tasted really nasty. I'd buy the Balance Bars again, and plan on doing so. Even my children liked them! The bars gave me energy when I ate them in the late afternoon. They were a real pick-me-up! I'd recommend this product to a friend in a heartbeat. It's nice to know you can buy a nutritional bar that tastes good and seems more like a snack!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I liked the Breath Right Nasal Strips. They kept my nostrils open all night, and I have had no problem with them lasting all night. As a matter of fact, until I started taking them off in the shower, they were still very secure when morning came around. I had a difficult time peeling them off until I got them wet and soapy. I also appreciate the fact that I don't have to take drugs to keep my nose clear at night."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,"THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE IN YOUR MOVIE COLLECTION. IT IS FILLED WITH COMEDY, ACTION, AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU WANT TO CALL IT."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,3.0,"The EZ Dose One-Day-At-A-Time Medicine Dispenser is handy for keeping track of days and times to take medication. Each day and time span is clearly marked on each individual lid, and it also has Braille for the sight impaired. Each compartment is deep enough for holding a good amount of pills -- I would say 3-5 average-size pills comfortably. The downside is that it's difficult to snap the lids shut. One must push tightly until it snaps and it could be difficult for someone with weak hands, an impairment, or arthritis. This also holds true for returning the daily pill strip box to the weekly tray. Not as simple a task as perhaps it should be for someone who's ill."
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"I liked these as soon as I put them in my shoes. It even seemed like my shoes fit better. I will probably get another pair, and I've already recommended them to several of my friends."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I'd very much recommend this product. Where most products of this nature are typically very sweet, this one was not overly sugary. It's a pretty good in-between snack and great to take on the go. I took them to work and had them in the late afternoon when I usually have my cravings for sweets from the snack machines."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is a great product. Unlike other nutritional or supplement bars (i.e., Power Bar), it's not chewy-gooey and bland. It actually has a great taste. It does not make you feel bloated or stuffed, yet does fill you up and aids in energy. I really enjoyed this product and highly recommend it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I really enjoyed the Balance Bar 40-30-30, Naturally, Yogurt Honey Peanut flavor. They were better than I expected and I will definitely buy them again. I especially enjoyed the fact that much of the protein was from soy, which has many health benefits. It was an easy, delicious, and quick way for me to integrate more soy into my diet. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick, healthy snack."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I was really pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. For all the nutrients it contained I expected it to taste a bit like chocolate-flavored paneling or something comparable. It was actually great. Had a dense, yet rather moist consistency, with a very good flavor. The size is such that it's easy to carry with me on the go and could easily be slipped into a shirt or jacket pocket. I really liked to have one after a workout to give me a very nutritious boost. I imagine if one is looking for a quick, nutrition bar that in NO way skimps on flavor, this one is worth the money. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,What a great surprise these bars were! I'm a hiker and have used other brands of energy bars -- most of which do the trick but taste like sawdust. The Balance Bar is moist and tasty with the added bonus of a yogurt coating. I had one for breakfast and it lasted me well into lunch with no hunger cravings. I love that they are nutritionally balanced and I will certainly take them along on my next hiking trip.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"The bars were pretty good. Not too chemical-tasting, but a typical sports bar nonetheless. Bland. Texture of cardboard but better than most in consistency. Not sticky like Power Bars. I'd recommend them if you can accept that all sports bars invariably taste like packing material. Good protein content."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is a good snack or break food. After my afternoon workout, it filled me up and gave me energy. It satisfied my craving for a sweet chocolate taste too. It had a good chewy texture and it gave my mouth a good workout, flavor, and chew. It was a bit high on the calorie range, but had all the nutrients to keep it healthy."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"My children seemed to really like them. They have a slightly different taste than what I expected. They're almost like a Fig Newton chewy. They were very filling and helped us feel that we were no longer hungry. They helped us feel more energetic. My family tried the product and the children seemed to be the most impressed, although the adults also thought that they felt more """"alive""""."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,I'm very sorry but I don't know of a nice way to say this
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste was just as good as any other power-type bar that I've tried. But it wasn't something that I'd crave. I expected it to provide me with more energy, kind of like taking a vitamin. Perhaps not that day, but the next. To be honest, I didn't notice much difference in my level of energy. With the price that they charge for purchasing a power bar, I don't think I'd recommend it to friends and family. I do think that I may purchase them again for myself though."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I really liked the flavor of the bars. They were a little sticky however. You need your beverage near by. The ingredients were about the same as other bars, but I felt the flavor was better! I would definitely recommend this product to people who are health minded. I hope the other flavors are as good."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"The Balance Almond Brownie Bar provides a nutritious alternative for when you need a chocolate fix. Unlike other nutritional food bars I've tried, this one pays close attention to providing not only the vitamins you need but also the minerals. Without sacrificing taste, it provides a good balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. While it did taste rather good (especially compared to some of the other brands of bars I've tried that resembled flavored cardboard in taste and texture) the Almond Brownie Balance Bar is somewhat dry, though consuming it with a tall, cold glass of milk resolves this issue."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I thought these nutrition bars were quite good. I've tried nutrition bars in the past and have always been disappointed. These bars not only tasted good, but they actually filled me up. I'm a college student and a lot of times I don't have time to stop and eat a full meal between classes. These bars were perfect for an on-the-go burst of energy. I've already recommended them to my fellow roommates and they all enjoyed these bars as well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet. Too sweet, in fact. They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth. They're good on the run, but unless you're used to lots of sugar in the morning, I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast. Maybe in place of dessert though."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"The taste was slightly chalky but altogether pleasing. After all, it's NOT a candy bar! Also, it would be a great idea to place a set of instructions for use in with the product. I ate one bar for breakfast and one for lunch, but I had no idea if that was a reasonable use of the product. Finally, the bars are easy to open and easy to carry in a purse or a backpack. I'll be buying more Balance Bars for my meals of the future!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I really like this nutrition bar. I've tried many nutrition bars over the years and I rate this one right in the top two or three. It's very tasty -- much like a cross between a chocolate/raspberry truffle and a 3-Musketeers bar. My kids like them too.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Very tasty, my kids loved them. They're kind of messy though -- my three year old got the other layer of yogurt covering all over himself and everything else he touched. These bars are great if you don't have time in the morning to fix a big breakfast -- just eat one of these and you're good to go 'til lunchtime."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,This is an excellent product. Very comfortable and easy to use. I didn't have any discomfort adjusting to using these insoles. They make walking more comfortable.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"What I liked about this product was the fresh taste. This bar was moist and you could really taste the ingredients (peanut butter and chocolate chips.) For me, the bar was very filling just by itself, but for my husband it wasn't as filling. Overall, the bar was of good quality and tasted good. I think that compared to other bars of the same nature, this one would have to be better."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I really liked the taste of the Power Bars. They were by far the best food bars I've ever eaten. They didn't really taste like peanut butter, but the chocolate was good. They were very dense, so it was hard to eat the whole thing. I really enjoyed them a lot!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I thought this Power Bar was great! I'm a fitness nut always looking for ways to improve my level of fitness. This will certainly be added to my shopping list. The chocolate taste was superb, and the bar was quite filling. With only four grams of fat and seven grams of protein, it was a great snack that filled me up. And I do mean filled me up. With a large glass of water, it kept me going for a couple of hours without being hungry. The texture of the bar, if you're not use to sports bars, was heavy, but that's where the """"filling"""" comes in. It lives up to its promise to being a moist and crunchy energy bar! I'd surely recommend it over other ones that I've tasted. The real chocolate really makes the bar!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"These didn't really taste the way I expected and I didn't care for them. I like peanut butter and chocolate chips, but I just didn't like them together. My son and husband both loved them, so I guess it's your preference. Maybe I will try a different flavor because I need all the energy I can get."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,Depends Fitted Briefs withstood our test! We had NO nighttime leaks. Other products that we've used so far have always eventually leaked. We're pleased with this product and will recommend it to others looking for a nighttime diaper system for bigger children or adults.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"The Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Harvest Power Bars are great! My husband and I like to use them during our bike rides. We typically ride between 30-40 miles at a time, and half way through, we like to stop and take a Power Bar break. The Power Bars are great for giving you a little bit of extra energy, plus they help if you're getting a little hungry. They're a nutritious snack and they taste great. The Harvest Bars have the texture of a granola bar. The other bars have a smooth texture, whereas these give you some crunch. It really does taste like Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip. I would definitely recommend this product to someone if they asked for a recommendation for an energy bar. Great stuff!"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I choose this product because I help care for my elderly grandmother. This product deserves its name. She suffers with bladder control both day and night. The fit of these is great, especially in the leg area. The absorbency is excellent. She has spent a lot of restless nights having to get up and change, because of leakage and just feeling wet. This was never a problem with the Depends. She just slept through the night. I would recommend this product to everyone. They're rather costly, but you get just what you pay for and that's what really counts."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I'm a college student and I found this bar to be extremely convenient. The day after I received them I woke up ten minutes before class began. I jumped out of bed, grabbed a bar, and raced towards class. The bar was incredible -- it had a sweet peanut flavor that wasn't too sweet. It had a pleasant aftertaste, unlike other bars. The bar was light but satisfying. Usually I end up eating too much and falling asleep in class. Whether it was the nutrition or the ginseng, this product was great for energy. I'd use it again and again."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,This product is excellent. They helped keep my feet dry and odor free. They also added cushioning to my shoes. I'd definitely recommend them to all my friends and family.
health personal care,health care,cough cold,3.0,"These drops taste good, for a cough drop. I don't really like cough drops and these tasted too much like medicine for me. I might use them if I had a sore throat, or if I were a cough drop person, I'd probably really like these a lot."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"this is one ofthe best i have ever heard for nature-type new age music. some gentle rain, flutes, and other instruments. it expresses the gentle beauty and mustique of the forest. i reccommend it to anyone! it's also very relaxing for me and the flow of the music is very pleasing. enjoy!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,3.0,"The test was easy enough to use. However, it was messy, as the urine collection pad didn't have a cover on it. You have to place it on the table with the collection pad facing downwards (since the result window is on the other side) and that resulted in a most unhygienic and messy situation with urine on the table. I found that to be the biggest drawback. Also, reading the results wasn't easy; there's a difference between the darkness of the lines, even if you have two lines that would indicate a positive result. I think it's an average product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"After using this product daily, as directed, I really didn't notice any change."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I'd most definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends. I've been taking pain medication for several years for a back and neck injury. I look forward to purchasing more of this product. I'm so glad to have found an online store to handle my family's needs.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,I thought the product was like any other of the Advil-type products that are out on the market now. I liked taking the smaller pills.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,2.0,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I tried several different sizes of tablets, pills, and vitamins -- everything I had in the house. It just crushed everything into powder. The instructions were no help at all. I couldn't figure out which direction the tablets should go in. I tried every way and no results. This product isn't worth the money."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,I used Cortaid Intensive Therapy Cream to treat a bout of contact dermatitis. I sometimes get a rash under my rings and have never found a great over-the-counter treatment -- until now. I was sooo surprised at how well this took care of the rash. I felt relief instantly and within a few hours the rash was gone. Will definitely continue using this product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"These drops taste great, and really helped my allergy-induced sore throat. I'd buy them from drugstore.com again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I love this product. It has a great taste. The packaging seems to keep the bars fresh. They are very delicious. I look forward to buying this item.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I've been taking calcium for quite a while and really prefer these over the brand I was taking. These were smaller and easier to swallow. They also had more calcium per tablet so I didn't have to take as many. They actually saved me money and I'd definitely recommend these to anyone taking calcium on a daily basis.
health personal care,health care,unknown,4.0,These ear plugs were very comfortable and reduced noise significantly. I also like the carrying case provided to keep them clean.
health personal care,health care,diabetes,3.0,"I liked the opportunity to Test Drive this product. I, however, found this to be somewhat complicated to use. It comes with an instructional video that helped somewhat, but it took quite some getting used to compared with the traditional needle injection. I plan on practicing and using it more."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I liked that these vitamins are designed with women in mind and come prepackaged in daily packets. That way, there's only one box of vitamins instead of several. The only problem I had was that when I took the entire packet (with a meal), I became nauseous. I remedied that problem by dividing the packet and took them with lunch and dinner. I'd recommend these vitamins to a friend."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"My mom hurt her shoulder over the weekend, and the Ace Instant Cold Compress was a great help. It was instantly cold and provided some much-needed relief to her aching area. I'd definitely use this product again -- it was fast and simple to use!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"This product seems little better than similar products I've tried. I think the taste is better, but there's the same residue left in your mouth after chewing it thoroughly and swallowing. It helps with acid stomach as it's advertised. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it, but I wouldn't recommend it above others I've tried."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,3.0,"These tablets claim to taste better than most other antacids and that point is true...there isn't the nasty chalky aftertaste that other antacids have. However, other than that, Amitone works the same as all the other antacids. I cannot tell any difference with Amitone over the others. So, if you're tired of the aftertaste of other antacids, try Amitone."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,The Melatonin was the perfect thing to help me get to sleep. It didn't make me too groggy in the morning and it wasn't too strong. It isn't something that I'd use every night. It helped me just get my sleep schedule back on track. I can still fall asleep the nights after I've used it.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,This product worked great for me. I've been so used to just drinking Mylanta or Pepto that taking a small pill was a great change. I like that I can take it prior to eating foods that will normally upset my stomach and the upset is prevented. I can now enjoy just about any food without acid discomfort.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,4.0,"This product is in very nice and discreet packaging. The name doesn't belie what's enclosed, which is essential when one feels the need to keep such matters as adult incontinence private. I thought the price was expensive, but the product, Serenity Pads, is a good product. It holds fluids as described on the packaging. I would suggest a stronger deodorant brand, however, to keep odors hidden."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"This is a quick, easy, and safe way to check temps especially on children. You don't have to worry about glass breaking and you can feel confident that the reading will be accurate."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"These are the best liners for baby. They are easy to handle, easy to fill and durable. Best of all they are easy to dispose of and store. My neice's and nephew's used theses and they are currently on my registry for our first child! I would not choose any other liner on the market!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I am a nursing, working mom and I have found that these little containers are a lifesaver! They attatch to the bottom of the Isis pump (also by Avent) for no hassle pumping. Then the top goes on tight, so you don't have to worry about leakage or spillage (if you were to pour into another container).Much easier to deal with than bags that flop over in the freezer and get into wierd shapes. These Avent Breast Milk containers can stack very easily so they don't take over your freezer. I recomend putting a sticky label (I use address labels cut in half) with the date and time expressed on top of the rubber sealing disc, as this is the easiest place to totally remove the adhesive gum.The baby sitter just has to screw on a new Avent cap with nipple attatched (or pop the sealing disc out and put a nipple in). If you later decide to make your own organic baby food in your blender or food processor, these containers can also be used to store &amp; freeze your baby's first foods!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"Washing bottles has never been easier! This has been an easy way to clean bottles in a matter of minutes versus waiting for the dishwasher or hand washing them- so easy my husband helps all the time! This item is also great for traveling and you can even sterilize other itmes as pacifiers, plastic spoons etc. Just becareful when you open the unit not to burn yourself with the hot water. Another helpful tip- when drying the bottles, cloth diaper rags work great."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,2.0,"Michael Keaton brings no distinguishing characteristics to the ghoul 'Beetlejuice', he merely acts bizarre, as does the script. It is often stunning cinematography but when the movie itself comes into focus, it's like finding one of Beetlejuice's snacks in your popcorn."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I was very surprised to read some negative comments about this item. This massager is dynamite! It massages deep and is very effective. Great for sore muscles after a workout. Two of my relatives have already bought this for themselves after trying mine. Definitely go with this model which has heat! It's great solo, but even better when your partner does it for you!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"We have been using the AVENT bottle system for supplementing our child as well as feeding pumped breast milk. This was the system recommended to us by a lactation consultant. They are very handy, easy to drink from, and easy to wash. The only problem we have had is if the nipples aren't on just right, the bottle will leak at the collar. But other than that the bottles and nipples are very durable (still look like new after months of use). We are additionally very satisfied with the AVENT pacifiers.If I had to purchase the bottles all over again, I would buy more 9 oz. bottles. It doesn't take long for the babies to get to the point where they are drinking more than 4-5 ozs (what the smaller bottles hold)."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"Aside from the noise it makes(like a cow) the pump is malfunctioming after 4 weeks of use. The on off button doesnt always work and it is losing suction and power. And since I can't find a 1 800 number for the manufacture, cant return it to the store of purchase( &quot;sanitary reasons&quot; ),and if i return it to the manufacture i have to get a replacement while this one is out of service, we have no choice but to mess with it ourselves. As a first time mom i prefer to give birth again than to try and use this pump at work , my only private place since the machine is so loud will be out in the car and hope that noone walks by. They need to have better customer support from this manufacture."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,This film is awesome. The DVD is not what it could be. Warner Brothers must not like special editions or Tim Burton or something. Superman has a special edition DVD. Burton's Beetlejuice does not nor does his Batman films. But this particular Burton film deserves a special editon more than any fim Burton has made. I'm still waiting for a sequel.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"Although I've been using it for less than a week, I do use it 3 times per day at work. I have the Pump in Style breastpump, but its a bit heavy to carry with all the other things I carry to work (including a laptop) it was just too big. Also, my office is completely opened - everything has windows - including the private offices (if you can call them private) as well as the conference rooms. The only place I can really pump is in the restroom. And although the restroom has outlets, I'm not big on standing out in the open with women walking in and out and anyone being able to look in and see me in the mirror with my breast hanging out. So basically this works well for my situation, so far, because I can hang out in one of the stalls and pump away. The only complaint I really have is that it is pretty noisy and I'm sure it will eat through batteries. I will probably see about investing in some rechargeable batteries and see if that works for me."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"I have chronic back and neck pain and some arthritis. I have used and worn-out a number of massagers over the years. Usually my complaint is that they are too noisy and get hot after a few minutes of use. The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is no exception. It's no louder than any of the others, and it gets too hot to use after about 15 minutes. I believe the manufacturer warns of this in the instructions. What I didn't expect was that the darn thing would bite! Yes, the HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager not only bites, it pulls hair. If you get it near your hairline, or near an area that is small, like your earlobes, you will get bitten and pinched. The manufacturer also warns of this, but who reads instructions. The HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager is also heavy (about 4 pounds)and cumbersome. It's potentiometer allows for some variation in the speed of the vibration, but the effects at lower speeds seem to be more powerful (and painful) than the teeth-jarring you get at higher speeds. Panasonic used to make a good massager, and I will look for that the next time I buy one. (Which may be the next time I get an earlobe caught in the jaws of the HoMedics PA-1 Action Massager)."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"After my first portable breast pump died I decided to try this one because I liked the idea of saving time with the double pumping option. I found that not only was the suction not as strong with this model, but it would take at least three hands to use the double pumping option. Perhaps I am simply uncoordinated, but it seems that I was only able to get both to work for a minute or so, before I would make a small move and would have to spend another 5 minutes trying to reposition. Once I was able to get things working properly I found it to be a painful experiance. I DO NOT recommend this for any person who has large breasts or is not a contortionist."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,"Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it. i compared the widescreen and the full screen. and the full screen seems to comtain more picture at the top and bottom. which must mean, that all they did was take the full screen version, cut off the top a bottom slightly and call it widescreen. which is strange because i would expect it to be easier just to make the theatrical version than to carefully edit the full screen and rip many people off."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,A definite must have if you own a Medela pump in style. Its esy to pump anywhere you go by just plugging into your cars cigarette lighter.I have found no difference in suction between using the a/c adaptor in the house or the car adaptor......
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We love our Quick Serve bottle warmer. It is fast, and works great with our disposable bottles. We have used a more expensive warmer in the past, and this one works even better. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking. It is easy to use- just put the water in, turn it on, and by the time you get a diaper changed, it is ready. It works with steam, so the bottle isn't soaking wet when you take it out."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"Winona Ryder is HOT! HOT! HOT! as the gothic death-rock princess of Doom (see &quot;Lucas&quot; for more W.R. action) The best performance from that eldest Baldwin brother that I've ever seen from any of them.His zenith I'm sure. BEST PERFORMANCE - goes to - Miss Ryder!,of course, I'm a BIG fan, you see? FAV PART - when Beetlejuice was chumming up to Baldwin's character while wearing the same type clothes. No big deal, just witty and clever charm with spit. and when Beetlejuice hits up on Gina Davis and/or Winona Ryder"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"After a long day, I spend a few minutes on my massager and the strain of the day eases away all the tension in my body. I had the ""chair"" version. This one is better. I even got my husband hooked and he is a physiologist who doesn't usually advocate homeopathic therapies...a great product at a great price. (Other places sell it for (much more).)"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Wow, what a great product. I purchased this for my sister - who just had twins. This saves her HOURS of preparation as she is very careful to have no germs anywhere near her precious babies. As a 31 yar-old first-time mom, she cried and was worried that she couldn't handle motherhood when she initially got home with her twin preemies. Products like this really made the transition much easier for her, and after four weeks, she feels pretty confident with what she's done and learned already. This product is a *snap* to use, and she can spend her available time doing other needed things. I highly recommend this to every new mom - ESPECIALLY of multiples!!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I have the From Dusk To Dawn warmer which is wonderful but is to big to carry the whole thing back and forth from the kitchen to the bedroom at night and vice versa. That's why I bought this one to keep on the kitchen counter for daytime feedings. I am so glad I did. This is a great warmer! Its terrific design holds ANY kind of bottle PLUS includes a special basket to heat baby food jars. The water vile is transparent and has lines so you can customize and remember the perfect water level for the amount of formula your heating. The &quot;on&quot; button lights up when it is running and shuts off automatically when it is fully heated. (My 4 yr old son even tells me when the bottle is ready) Its also nice and small so it doesnt take up much room on your counter. I'm very glad I purchased this product.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,I would recommend this pump to everyone. If you are not going back to work and don't need to pump all day long this is the product for you. If you can't get let down with this pump then there is a problem. I never had any problem with let down. In fact I find the suction overwhelming and need to back off a bit. I can usually pump 5 ounces in under 10 minutes. I have been using mine for 8 months and it just died on me and will go buy another. It's like any other electric object. If you use it long enough it's sure to go. As for the noise...oh well. It's a better pump then the Evenflow.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,The Advent Bottle Warmer was given to us as a gift and we swear it is the one thing we use the most. We heat up all bottles and food for our little girl in this warmer. We even leave a bottle of water in the warmer at all times (on low) for emergency feedings. We can't begin to tell you how useful the warmer has been for us. We are always ready for what our little girl needs. By the way if your Advent bottle warmer is over filling use common sense and don't put that much water in it!!! Heeellooo.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"When I was expecting my first child I had a decision to make. What type of bottle would I use? I did not want the added expense of disposable bottle liners and some bottles said they made less air but I couldn't see how. So we chose VentAire. We only bought 3 bottles and that was all we used until she was 1 year. She never had gas or really had to be burped after her formula was gone. Which was great because she would wake up if we tried. I went through nipples like crazy because my fiance could not understand the whole, do not put the bottle brush through the nipple idea. Now we are expecting our 2nd in April and are going back to VentAire. I recommend it to everyone I know and will always use them. The only problem I have is at the top where the nipple screws on there is an area where formula can get caught. It is hard to get it out, but the benefits from VentAire out weighs this little problem. Soaking in super hot water and cleaning from the bottom up helps get it out. If you are considering these bottles GET THEM!! Mine wered dropped from grocery carts and thrown across the room and never had a scratch on them. They last through everything and then some."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,The only good thing I can say about these bottles is that they can turn into a sippy cup otherwise its so frustrating they leak all the time I have 5 bottles that all leak my friend had the same problem not worth it I hate hearing my son cry because I have to stop and mess with the bottle.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I used this warmer 4 times. Each time I got an electric shock from it. I know there has to be a safer alternative. Perhaps another brand. I started to just fill up a bowl with HOT tap water and place the bottle in it for a couple of minutes. I found that to work just as well, and was not as painful as the shocks!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Before I got this bottle warmer, I was warming bottles in a saucepan on the stove, which took anywhere from 3 - 5 minutes, while my newborn screamed his head off, at 3am, waiting for his bottle. This warmer is one of the best, I think. It only takes about 1 - 2 minutes to warm up a bottle to the perfect temperature, provided you follow the instructions. I had to play around with it at first, getting it to work perfectly, but after a couple of days of adjusting the amount of water I used, I got it right. My son is 10 months old now, and I still use this warmer, and I've never had a problem with it either."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"HOW TO FIX THE LEAKINGDON'T TIGHTEN THE TOP VERY TIGHT. This may seem counter-intuitive, but just turn until very slightly snug. That does it. We tried it a couple of times with Avent bottles full of water. No leaks. Not a one. It seems that over tightening is the #1 reason for leaks.Our babies loved the Avent bottles/nipples, but the leaking drove us absolutely nuts until I finally found the answer on the Avent website in a frequently asked questions section."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in ""Beetlejuice."" His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I breastfeed, pump, and supplement fomula. This sterilizer is prized! Easy and holds enough items. I sterilize my breast pump too. My husband and I don't use enough dishes to run the dishwasher daily and this is much more convenient...sterilize when you want to and no danger of forgetting bottles on the stove.Excellent!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I also had a hard time getting bottles warmed up just right...I had to constantly shake the bottles and then re-heat to get an all over even temperature due to uneven heating. It's much quicker to warm bottles with hot water, however, it is very convenient to warm bottles upstairs in the middle of the night."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"My son would cry in pain, his little belly would fill with gas and get hard as a rock! I would give him dropper after dropper of Mylicon and after suffering for awhile he would fall asleep exhausted! The doctor said there was nothing that we could do - he was just a gassy baby. Then I found this bottles!!! It has been 4 weeks now and not one episode!!I can't believe more people don't know about these! They are the BEST bottle money can buy!!With ordinary bottles when he was sucking on the nipple you can see the bubbles coming up in the formula, and he would collapse the nipple and get frustrated. With these he gets nothing but formula in his little belly!I have been telling everyone about them, even my doctor hadn't heard of them and not she's recommending them to everyone!...Don't wait until your baby is in pain - Go get them now!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I bought these containers/bottles before I had my dd 11/06/99 and they have been through the microwave, freezer, dishwasher and have been sterilized by boiling. They have been used as milk containers, bottles and food containers.We currently use them with the avent sippy cup teats and they are leak proof.We will be having another baby shortly and I think they will probably outlast the the next baby too...Probably one of the best investments I have made baby wise."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"I received this thermometer as a gift at my shower. I have not had any of the problems that the other people have had. Mine seems to work great! I have found the covers at BabiesRUs stores, on the lowest shelf where the thermometers are. They are also at the Wal-Mart by me. So far, it has been accurate. I have tested it against my regular digital thermometer and they both come up with the same reading. Good luck!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I'm on the site looking for an alternative bottle warmer because my wife and I, after four months of practice, still hasn't caught the hang of it. Never seems to be just the right amount of water and most often the bottles overheat. We then end up setting them in a bowl of cold water and testing repeatedly until they've cooled down enough. Don't know if the perfect warmer is out there, but this certainly isn't it and we plan to keep looking."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"After figuring out that I was going to pump and bottle feed, my husband went out and found this. It has been great! We sterilize not only the bottles, but pacifiers and my pumping equipment. I think that we will probably use it for some plastic toys as well, when the time comes. Within minutes the bottles cool off, which is great if they are needed as soon as possible.This would make an awesome shower gift!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I purchased this pump hoping that I would be able to double pump during my lunch break at work. After only two weeks of pumping twice during an eight hour period, the pump quit on me. I called the company &amp; they sent me an entire new pump. About four weeks later, I was only able to single pump &amp; had to call the company again. They sent me just an arm replacement. It has been another four weeks &amp; I have to call the company again for another arm replacement.Even though I have had problems with this pump, the company has been helpful enough in sending me replacement parts. But I wish I had not purchased this product."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,After using several name brand bottles claiming to reduce gas Ifinally bought Dr. Brown's. Immediately after eating I noticed a difference in him he was'nt spitting up as much and he seemed more comfortable. They have several pieces to clean but I put them on the top rack of the dishwasher and that works like a charm. Forget the other's this bottles really works.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love this sterlizer. IT makes my life so much easier. I formula feed my 3 month old, so Im washing bottles constantly. I have to wash at least 12-14 bottles at the most a day. And If I forget a day...forget it. Well we have saved an great amount of time using this. It keeps you bottles and nipples looking new, not like the boiling thing where it gets all cloudy. They look just the way they did when I bought them. Its conventent, not to mention you feel confident that your babies bottles & other things are clean...bacteria free, I even put in her hard toys pacifers... everything. YOu savew money not haviong to buy more bottles ect cause of the cloudiness from boiling the bottles.We don't even use Avent bottles and it still works great. I recommend this to anyone."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I knew I wanted to use these bottles, but didn't know much else about them. I remembered using these bottles for my brothers and sisters, so I figured they have stood the test of time. This was a great way for me to try the different selections. I really recommend the bottles with the slides on the side to let out the air. Everyone who sees me using it thinks they are great. We have had no problems with the baby getting too much air. She burps for us at every feeding. She is 2 months old so they have gotten a lot of use already."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I received these bottles as well as the Avent bottles as baby shower gifts, so I used them interchangeably. The VentAire did NOT reduce the air in the bottles at all. There was just as much air in these bottles as in any other brand. An additional problem was in cleaning these bottles. There are grooves and little raised decorations all over the bottle, and little tiny drops of milk get trapped in there, even after hand washing and machine washing. Mold quickly grows in these little grooves. The Avent bottles were completely smooth inside, so they were very easy to clean."

I recommend a stool too to get your feet off the ground. The cover on this one is not removeable, I might have prefered that option for washing, but I really liked the fabric pattern."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"Two weeks after my daughter was born, I had to introduce her to a bottle. I chose the AVENT system, since that's what many moms recommended to me because I was exclusively breastfeeding. My daughter struggled to use them for 3 weeks, and then just started playing with the nipples. After trying a couple of others, I finally switched to this system, and found success!! I love not having to sterilize after each feeding, the drop in liners, and being able to pump breastmilk directly into the bags. My daughter still likes the infant nipple almost as much as the breast, and is a much happier baby. So, if you're a breastfeeding mom having trouble introducing a bottle, try this system!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I have tried most bottles that are sold in stores. This bottle has a lid that actually keeps the bottle from leaking. It costs a little more than other bottles but the price is worth it. No more digging in the diaper bag and there is spilt milk.

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"This was the first warmer we had when our son statred to drink from a bottle. We were happy with it at first, but as many of the other reviews say, there is no on-off switch. That is a pain. However, if you keep an eye on it, the bottles do warm up pretty quickly and evenly I still use it when I travel. It's small enough to fit in a suitcase. This would not be my first choice if I had to pick another warmer, but it's okay for when I need it."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I picked out this warmer for my registry and received it at my shower. It is so easy to use it. You do have to use the smaller amount of water for smaller amounts of formula. Always check it on your wrist first just to make sure its not too warm though. You get the hang of it after a few times. My parents watch the baby while my husband and I are at work, so they bought the same warmer to use at their house. They have no problems with it either. All of us recommend buying this warmer!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.) I would use these bottles up until you need to make 8oz of formula. *If you use powder formula - the drop-in liners DO NOT hold 8oz of water and the formula you add to it!! I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I received this product as a present at my baby shower and I love it. As a working Mom this is a life saver. It is so quick and easy to use. I would recommend this to every Mom.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,I got this as a gift and love it. You have to experiment with the water tempature first.- I used regular milk so I wouldn't waste formula. I like the compact size. I move it to the bathroom by the nursery. I put in the bottle (avent) and it's heating while I change her diaper and finished just in time. I used a black marker to mark the fill line so it can be seen easily at those 2AM feedings. The biggest downfall is that you have to wait 10 minutes to reheat again. For the price it is well worth it.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I love these bottles! My daughter has done great with them and has no problem going from the bottle to breast. I like that the top is wider to be able to put powdered formula in without the mess.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,This hand pump was really a work-out for my hands. It was very frustrating pumping with my hands and that caused let-down to be difficult.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I knew I needed to sterilize things at least in the beginning. I had watched my sister-in-law laborously boil everything. I am so glad I bought this sterilizer. I sterilize everything and not just my avent items. It is quick and simple.
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"I used to get plantar warts every once in a while back in my childhood and teenage days. Thanks to these outbreaks, I was exposed to three treatment methods, Compound W being one of them. I hated using this stuff-- it rates a bit higher than my getting stuck right in my arch with a big needle of anesthetic to numb it so I wouldn't feel the laser burning the wart away, but it was a painful treatment none the less. Its active ingredient is a powerful acid, after all. At least the laser burn-off took care of the problem in less than a half-hour. But with this stuff, you hafta apply it to the wart twice a day for up to 12 weeks (it took 3 weeks for me)!My advice"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,This sterilizer is the best. I use it everyday. It holds bottles and parts from my Medela breast pump. I would be lost without it. It is easy to use and can hold anything.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I have the previous version of this warmer and absolutely loved it. I will definately use it with my next child. Avent is wonderful.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"My son was born 51/2 weeks early, and as a result I had to use a breastpump 8 times a day until he could breastfeed. I consider myself something of an expert now, after all of that, and I adore this handpump! I was nervous about giving up my hospital grade rental once he was home and breasfeeding exclusively, but this pump really is amazing. I use it at least once a day, so that Dad can feed him, too, and it is very efficient. My first handpump left me in tears, but I swear this pump works almost as well as the hospital's, with a little hand workout to boot!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"My son has been completely breast fed. When it was time to start trying bottles, we tried them all. Avent, Dr. Browns the playtex nurser even the Gerber contour. This bottle was the only one he doesn't play with. He can easily get his mouth all the way around the nipple and gets a good seal.I do agree that the stage one nipples are a little slow, and the stage 2 are too fast. I have modified the nipples myself so that they flow a little faster.Also the newer version is much easier to take the vent out of the bottom. We haven't had any clogging problems, but we separate it out everytime we clean the bottle.The only thing that is bad is that it is difficult to warm them, unless you are using a crock of water, because of the bottom.It is important for you to try different bottle to see which one works for you and your baby. I suggest buying one of each to see which one works, then buying more of the one that work"
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"These are essential if your job calls for a little old-style cutting and pasting. Cut fingers at deadline are too frequent when you work with an exacto blade. I like these, especially, because the flexible fabric is much more comfortable than the old plasticy feel of original band-aids."
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"This is one of the best products! I cut up fresh fruit and stick a couple of pieces in and give it to my son (7 mos.) and it would keep him distracted for a while. I would give it to him in his high chair and could get a lot done around the kitchen while he was sucking. I was comfortable with this as I knew I could turn my back and he wouldn't choke! Another thing we do is stick an ice cube in it and he loves it, and it isn't very messy to clean up! I will definitely reccommend this product!!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I highly reccommend these bottles if your baby is in the least bit fussy! They are about the same price as the Avent bottles, and I have found that my son spits out much less milk with these bottles, and is generally a happy baby now. They are NOT a pain to clean if you use your dishwasher! Just buy one of those little dishwasher baskets and throw all the parts into it. I would suggest that you buy more bottles than you think you'll need. I only bought 6 of the 4oz bottles and ended up either having to run the dishwasher twice a day or washing bottles all day long. Now I have 9 8oz bottles and it's working perfectly. Also, do not fill the bottles past the line-they will leak if you do this. Finally, you can warm the bottles with all the parts in it, you just need to unscrew the lid first to avoid bubbles forming."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"It took forever to express milk. And it was so loud that if you tried expressing while the baby was sleeping forget it. Also, forget about watching TV while your expressing milk because you can't hear it. Too many parts to buy. My original pump did not work. No Suction. Second pump worked but when you have an infant who has all day to pump."
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"My 7 month old daughter liked this from day one. Just this morning I put in banannas. She spent 30-40 minutes gnawing in delight. I usually keep her in her high chair when using the feeder since it can cause a big time mess. Most often she'll need a bath not too long after.I'm a very nervous first time mom and have heard one to many horror stories about teething biscuits. But I didn't want to limit her to pureed baby food. I feel like this product is good for that in between time...before you start giving them cooked, chopped veggies etc to self-feed and long after they've mastered the art of opening their mouth in anticipation of food. This product will also give your little one a safe and nutritious way to satisfy their urge to chew when teething. It works just as well as they claim it does :-)"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"My husband has had to use every ounce of self restraint not to throw this thing against the wall. He brings our son to work and as many water combinations as he has tried, it always heats the water to boiling. It takes long enough to do that and then you get stuck waiting for it to cool down."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This is a really great product. The way it creates the bath is *so* much better than the jet spas Conair makes. The *ONLY* thing that I was angry about is that the type on the box reads, ""Will not heat water to a higher temperature, will maintain water tempurature"". While reading the pamphlet to find out how to choose a heat setting, I found the information, ""Does not maintain water temperature"". Nevertheless- this is the best home spa equipment I've come across. The price is great, the unit stores easily and the mat is more comfy than I expected."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I was really concerned about buying a pump because I have always heard that most aren't worth the money unless you buy an expensive one. I didn't plan on pumping more than a couple of times per week so I didn't want to spend a fortune but at the same time, didn't want to waste even a little money on one that didn't work. I decided on this one because I had heard that Medela was a good brand and it was the lowest model I could get in the electric/battery operated level. I have been very happy with this pump and have had no problems with me personally or with the pump mechanically. It works great, I can get my 4 oz bottle in 10 minutes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little noisy and also the only pump I've ever used so I have nothing to compare it to. I love it and wouldn't change. A word of advice to those having trouble and only pump for occasional use, pump first thing in the morning. I have read that is when you have the most milk and it has worked best for me."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"My baby is due any day now. I bought these bottles because I heard how great and wonderful they were. As I was preparing to wash the bottles and nipples getting ready for baby, I had the opportunity to really read the WARMING DIRECTIONS. This would have clearly been a nightmare; the bottles cannot go into a bottle warmer or microwave - they cannot be submerged into boiling water. My guess is that the formula must be warmed before going into the bottle? I'm really not sure. I am (obviously) going to be a first time mom and I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I'm hoping not to go into labor running around shopping for bottles that CAN BE WARMED."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"My husband started giving our baby a bottle of pumped breastmilk once or twice a day when the baby was 3 weeks old. It took him quite a few trials to determine the right amount of water for 4 oz of milk. He had many middle of the night feedings when the bottle became overheated, and he had to wait for it to cool. It seemed that the right amount of water was fairly inconsistent. The same exact amount would be perfect one time and too much the next. This was really frustrating. The steam heating method does work really fast, though. However, if those water-bath type warmers worked faster, we'd definitely prefer one of those since they hold the water at a constant temp and won't overheat."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,When my daughter was born we tried numerous formulas thinking that this was the problem with all of her gas and spitting up. Finally someone told me about these bottles and they were a lifesaver. She almost instantly stopped having the problems. As for cleaning the extra parts my bottles came with a little brush specifically for them and I rinse them out immediately and have not had any problems with them coming clean.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I recieved the advent pump as a gift. I loved the pump so naturally I bought the bottles that fit it. What a mistake the milk leaked constantly. I used the stage one slow flow but my daughter ( now 5 weeks) still gaged constantly. it would frustrate her to the point she refused both this bottle and my breast. I now use the maws angled bottles. These ""look"" similar to the advent system but work sooooo much better. She now goes easily from bottle to breast."
baby products,feeding,food,2.0,"This item is well designed and is easy to use, if you have small bottles. I used the Avent bottles and could not get them into the bottle slots. I also had a few playtex nursers that wouldn't fit. I ended up just using the drawers for washing the bottle nipples and rings in the dishwasher and giving it away as soon as my son was done with his bottles. If you plan to use the bottles witht he smaller/skinnier openings this product could be great, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This product has been very helpful. At first I thought it's a waste of money since we can boil the bottles. But boiling is a big hassle, and you really don't have time for it! The reason I gave the product only 4 stars is because the bottles do come out with condensation, and it's hard to get rid of it. All in all my husband and I are happy with this bottle sterilizer."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I understand the problems with the water measurement, but if you practice a bit and get the hang of it, it's a great little gizmo.I practiced with regular milk before the baby came and had it down to a science once she got here.I exclusively breastfeed and thought I would never use this thing until one night I pumped at the wrong time, she was hungry, and the bottle I just pumped was cold in the fridge. We pulled it out, dropped it in, VOILA! We've used it off and on for breastmilk ever since and it works great. Just experiment a bit.Also, I learned a neat trick"
health personal care,health care,thermometer accessories,4.0,The large LCD is great. The user's guide uses the smallest print known to man and I cannot figure out how to change the battery. An online user guide would be nice.
baby products,feeding,gift sets,5.0,"I used the bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old. At the beginning the feeding did take a long time but after less than a week she learned to work the nipple. And because you cannot use traditional steam type bottle warmers with this bottle it took a little more effort to warm the bottle in a pan of hot water. My second baby was always able to use regular bottles until I switched her to plain milk last week. Then it was spit up city. I happened to have one of the older versions of this bottle left over and started using it. From the first day there was no more spitting up. It did take her about 2 days to fully figure out the nipple, but it has been no problem for the last 2 weeks. I wish I had never gotten rid of the other 10 of these bottles that I had. I am going to buy more but I must admit right now that I am purchasing the older version which is still available in my area. Although I have seen the newer version and love the new way the bottom vent is designed I have read alot here about nipple collapse with this new version and my friend has also had the same problem. She has also told me that if you don't get the bottom vent in perfect on this newer version, you will experience the leaking problem because it will twist into the threads. That is enough to make me stick with the ""oldie, but goodie"" and deal with the extra time that using these bottles requires. And one final note, even though it says that people who have bought these bottles have also bought the First Years Bottle Warmer, if you use a steam based bottle warmer these bottles will leak from the bottom during heating. You can use the type of warmer that you fill with water such as the Avent one."
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"We adore this product![.] When we go out to eat, i put a lemon or other type of fruit in it and my 9 month old will chew on it for the whole meal. It not only gives him something to play with but something cold to gnaw on when he is teething!"

However, after enduring the lower back pain that ensued as a result, I caved in & bought this stool. It's been well worth the buy! No more back pain. I now nurse my baby comfortably. The stool was easy to assemble & is the perfect height for me (I'm 5'2""). I am very happy with this stool."

It's amazing how cold that room-temperature air feels coming out of that mat! It felt like I was sitting on a huge refrigerated gel pak or something.If that wasn't uncomfortable enough, the bath became less of a spa and more of a frightening cauldron! I've got one of those extra large triangle-shaped soaking tubs, so it looks just like the spa tubs except without the bubbles. However, all the other spa baths I've seen and used do not splash the water so far out of the tub that it hits the walls - this Conair mat did! I was afraid at first I had it on the &quot;high&quot; setting, but it was &quot;low&quot; that caused such a stir. The higher setting was, of course, no better. Not that I want to admit this, but I am not a small woman, so I would think that someone normally sized would get thrown around even more and shudder to think of it.I think I might have been able to get past the cold, but I can't relax while fearing that the water will splash out of the tub and onto the floor, cabinets, walls, etc, so the longest I could use the mat was for less than five minutes a couple of times. I'm hoping we can yet exchange it for another model."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"i found that if i rinsed the bottles with cold water after they were sterilized, they dried much quicker. this sterilizer has worked well for me, but i don't know that i'd purchase it again, as i don't sterilize this terribly often. the dishwasher seems to work just fine."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I used the avent bottles with my baby when she was still breast feeding and continued with them until she used a cup. I loved them. They leaked only a few times before I loosened the lid. If the milk flow was fast(as another parent mentioned) I switched to a nipple that had a slower flow. I especialy loved the nipples because they don't colapse in and cut off the flow of milk. Worth the investment!!!
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I am very pleased with this pump! After reading all of the reviews I decided to pick this one and I am glad I did. I have never used one before and it does take some getting used to at first and a little awkward, but I think using any pump would be. Once I got the hang of it (which didn't take long), I have really enjoyed using it. It was also a little intimidating with all the parts and peices there are but just read all the instructions before using it and before you know it, it becomes second nature taking it apart, washing it and putting it back together. I use it in the mornings when I am really full (I've noticed that if you use it when you are really full it goes alot faster) and it takes about 20 minutes to get about 4-5oz. But my daughter is now 21/2 months old so my supply has increased. When I first started pumping I would get about 2oz in that time, which was fine cause thats all she needed at a feeding. I really like the fact that you can pump right into the bottle, store the bottle, and then heat it put on a nipple and use the bottle. Its very convenient. I am a stay at home mom, but I am very glad that I got this particular set because its easy to transport the bottles and keep them cool. Also if I do need to pump while I am out it also comes in handy. Plus nobody knows what it is, its a very nice bag and looks just like a purse. I would highly reccommend this set to anyone(even if you don't work), it comes in really handy and as I said before easy to use and very effective."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"I bought this booster when I was 6 months pregnant. It looked like a good choice because of the easy-to-clean material, colors, and portable features. We begun using it when my son was almost 6 months old. He's now 7 months old and it's pretty obvious he won't be able to use the tray much longer, it won't fit his size. We have also had problems with the straps. One of them got loose and we lost it on our trip back home. I think it is a good choice for a booster seat, but not comparable to a high chair."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,I bought this based on other user's reviews and I am not unhappy. This is a little noisy in the aroma mode but using the combo of aroma and ocean waves puts me out before the 60 minute timer shuts the unit off. It works!
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,My son is only 7 months old so we have only used this a few times but it works great! All the food he scoops (usually cheerios)lands in the little scopped shelf. All the waitress' comment on how useful it is. I have used it on my placesetting (when he's on my lap)at restaurants to prevent him from putting his mouth on the dirty table. You can never be too safe about germs! Plus it gives him his very own dining area.I wish someone would have thought of this sooner! I have two older daughters that could've used this!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,We are constantly having to rewash things because they fall over into the sink. The parts were the bottles go are not very strong and don't support the bottles. Also you can't use it for large bottles. Try another brand.
baby products,feeding,gift sets,5.0,I loved this bottles. I used these with my 2nd child and would recommend them to everyone. Easy to Clean &amp; No Fussy Baby because of excess air getting in.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love these bottles. Yes, they do have some extra pieces to wash but it is totally worth it knowing my son is getting NO air when he drinks his bottle. After spending his first 2 months very colicky, I was willing to try anything. I wish I had just used these from the beginning. I recommend them to all my pregnant friends."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I purchased two of these bottles, and returned them the next day. My baby could not get anything out of them. I tried sucking on them myself and at first nothing would come out of the nipple, then I could somehow get it to work, and then it wouldn't work again. I called playtex, and they told me the baby's mouth has to be above the little lines on the nipple. I tried everything, even another nipple, but it was useless. After dealing with a worn out (and hungry) baby, I would have to say these are useless. I find myself pretty bright when it comes to figuring things out, but this bottle was beyond my ability. Feeding a baby should be simple!"
baby products,feeding,gift sets,1.0,"Don't waste your time or money on these bottles. I hated these bottles. You must buy the Ventaire nipples only, which my daughter did not like. (We used the Nuk Nipples, They are wonderful!) and the bottom was just more trouble that it was worth. Where your baby is scream because she is hungry the good old plain Gerber bottles are still the best. There is no assembly work needed. Just pour and serve!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"I registered for these baggies, because I had the Medela pump in style double electric pump. These bags were supposed to fit directly to the pump. They don't. They don't make a good enough seal for the pump to work. I still had to pump into the bottles and then pour them into the baggies. I have had no problems with leaking. The twist ties are a bit unhandy, but overall the baggies are good. I don't know if they are worth the price though. My suggestion"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"The advent bottles and nipples are terrible. My baby would not breasfead so I switched to bottles. The advent bottles with a newborn size 1 nipple tended to let too much milk flow through them. The baby spit up a lot of milk and it went down her chest. Also, she was sucking in too much air. These are supposed to be newborn nipples with slow flow, but they flow way too fast."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,The newborn size 1 nipples don't let enough milk flow for a newborn. You have to poke another whole in the nipple. THe size 2 nipples flow too much for a newborn. Other than the slight nipple problem the bottles are wonderful. They help prevent the baby from sucking too much air.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I purchased this seat because my 22 month old son (who is big for his age) just didn't seem comfortable in the fold away hard plastic one we had. He was always trying to slide down and wouldn't enjoy sitting in it. This seat is just the opposite! He sits in it great, he looks so much more comfortable and doesn't fuss to get out of it. Plus, with no crazy straps all around, it is so handy to just put on and take off the chair. I will admit, it may be a little pricey for what it actually is, but for me, it was well worth it!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I had been using the disposable pads and Purelan; but, still experienced soreness. After one entire day of use, these shells certainly made me feel a whole lot better. The upshot - seems to help draw out the nipples a little more too. My son found it a lot easier to latch after using these."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"Everyone used to tell me that Avent bottles were the best. They were supposed to give out less air and cause less gas for the baby. When my son was born we had to give him both breast and bottle. When it came to bottle time, mixing the formula was even a nightmare. The bottles leak if capped on too tightly. I've heard this from several other friends also. It leaked all over my hands and continued to do so everytime I prepare a bottle. Secondly, the hole in the slow flow nipple is actually too fast and made my newborn baby gag and choke several times. I thought maybe it was just his digestive system adjusting. But no, I noticed just letting it drip on my hand that it was flowing too fast. And if that wasn't enough, from the day we used these bottles I noticed my baby was spitting up way too much no matter how much I burped him and he had way too much gas than I thought he should. We finally decided to switch to Playtex and see if there was a difference. YES there was. He is less gassy, he eats a lot better and barely spits up. And now, there is no mess or leakage. I wouldn't recommend the Avent bottles."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I have had to return to work and pump during the day. My child (now 7 weeks) has no trouble taking the Avent nipples while I am away and then back to the breast in the evenings and weekends. Avent products are more expensive than others, but considering the alternative of not being able of breastfeed while I am am home, the difference in the cost is worth it. Replacement nipples are about the same cost as others anyway.I highly recommend Avent products if your baby has to go from breast to bottle and back."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,I bought this for my aroma-therapy and natural sounds addicted wife. It is a now a paper-weight. the sounds are not very natural and the smells are well...smelly.

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I have seen a lot of Avent products and they seem to overwhelm the store shelves. So, I fell victim and bought the entire line of bottles. These bottles are great to clean as they are very easy to get around the bottle neck. However, the nipples collapse something terrible when my baby sucks. This would cause her to fuss and let go of the nipple and I could hear the air fizzing as it filled back up. This ruined the whole mealtime experience for my daughter. I was very disappointed and switched to Evenflo Sensitive Response System. They work much better and I don't have to tilt the bottle as she gets near the end of the bottle. They tilt to always keep the nipple full of milk. Wonderful!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Perhaps there is a reason these are on sale for half off? Three separate packs were used out of my box -- each became only slightly heated. After applying the first wrap, I couldn't tell if it was working or not; that's how un-warm it was. That's why I opened another. This one felt warmer, but it never became hot, or even warm enough to cause any relief to the sore, crampy muscles. I would not purchase this product again, and in fact, tossed the unused portion of my box in the trash."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I had a premmie son on jan. 27, 2003. While he was in the hospital I went to buy some things to help me cope with the extra wakings from his health problems. This is one of the products that I bought. It was worthless sometimes it didn't heat the bottles and sometimes they were to hot. the messuring cups were hard to use and munuver. I would not recomend this product to anyone."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I got this as a shower gift and wasn't sure how much I'd use it. I use it everyday. I have the Avent bottles and breastpump and this works great in a short amount of time. You do not have to fuss with boiling water and I don't always have time to wait for the dishwasher especially since I pump everyday. This is a great gift to buy or to buy for yourself. I am so glad I got this.
baby products,feeding,gift sets,4.0,"My baby and I love these bottles. Initially the nipple's flow was very slow but I pierced a bigger openning and they work wonderfully. I noticed my baby was less gassy and a lot more happier than with Dr. Brown's bottles which turned out to be a leaking dissaster. I really don't recommend those. However, the Playtex Vent-Air work wonders and are so easy to clean. Just open the bottom for easy washing, leave them in hot soapy water for 15-20min.(as recommended by our pediatrician)and the sterilization process is completed. Very practical. We don't have to boil any bottles or deal with any leaks. I highly recommend them!I highly recommend these."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,I tried to use this pump for a few weeks and had an extremely hard time expressing milk with it. I had plenty of milk but this just didn't pump it out for me. I had to lean over so far to get the proper suction fit that my back was constantly hurting. ... the Isis was a huge waste of money.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I love this pump! Every time my husband and I leave the house it comes along with us. I do not like to breastfeed in public and this is perfect to use anywhere! I also use this pump at work. It is small enough to let me sneak off and do my thing. I would highly recomend this pump to anyone.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We purcahsed this for our 22 month old. we have been using a booster seat and it WAS NOT working. She was shaking it and could get the tray off. After several scares, we went to Babies r us, and tested her in MANY! Most were frilly &amp; ugly(ok, they were less money). Until we came to THIS ONE!! I love the Tan leather, easy to wipe, the 5 pt harness, and double trays. WE LOVE THIS CHAIR and can't believe we waited so long to buy it! It folds up also, so if you have a smaller kitchen like us.. It also come ready to use! all I did was unfold it, put on the rollers and was ready to use, no tools req! and worth the money(we paid 169.99)5 STARS!!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"My baby is a breastmilk fed baby only. Since I've had to go back to work, he has to have the bottle when I'm away. He really doesn't mind Avent or the Playtex Premium bottles. The best thing about the Avent is your choice of nipple flows. I use Avent bottles with the variable flow nipple for giving cereal to him when he doesn't want to eat it off of a spoon. It really is awesome!! As far as spitting up, air, gas bubbles, etc. He has no problem with them at all."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I received this as a shower gift off of my registry, and wasn't really sure what to expect (this being my first go at motherhood and nursing). I was very pleasantly surprised at the ease with which I could use this, and during the time I was home on maternity leave, I had opportunity to practice and store up for an out of town wedding we attended and for when I first returned to work. The simplicity of this pump made a potentially intimidating situation a breeze.I also own the Medela Pump 'N Style and while I found that to be a quality pump as well, once I got the hang of it, this pump allowed for more control over suction and for easier let-down. I also loved the convenience of this pump in that I didn't have to worry about any noise or finding an outlet, especially when I returned to work...I could use this pump anywhere, and I did. I also experienced cracking in the neck as some other reviewers have noted, but simply contacted Avent via the Web and they sent me replacement parts at no charge. I would also agree that there are a lot of little parts to disassemble and reassemble when cleaning this pump, but I never found that to be a deterrant in using it.I would highly recommend this pump to any mom, new or not-so-new, who is looking for a comfortable, easy way to provide 'nature's best' to their little one. It worked marvelously for me, and I plan to use this again with my next baby, without hesitation."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,These are BY FAR the best bottles. They are the best for gassy tummys! My mom used them with my sister (25 now) me (19) and my younger brother (14). The complaint I'm hearing the most is that it's hard to mix enough formula in them. I didn't find this as a problem b/c we mix the formula in a tupperware juice holder and pre make our bottles b4 we leave the house. I find that easier than dumping powdered stinkey formula all over the car ! :) Just a suggestion.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"We had trouble using these bottles, the nipples (size one) were too fast for my baby. Every time she would swallow she was spitting formula out the sides of her mouth because she was getting to much. She was also coughing alot due to the speed of the formula coming out.In addition, we had bubbles galore in the bottles!We switched to another brand and we do not have any of these problems.Save your money and go with something else! Expensive is not always the best!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"This warmer was aweful. I bought it for my kitchen, used it once and started walking to the other in my bedroom. Yes, it does have a fill line, and the directions are pretty easy to follow. It takes forever to warm and it has no on/off switch. This was as much a safety factor as a convenience issue. I returned it and bought a cheaper warmer that works much much better."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I just returned from Sweden where I went for my brother's wedding. I left my 6 month old at home with my husband. I was a bit worried about how this pump would perform-I didn't know if I would be able to adequately express myself so I also took my Bailey electric pump along. The Avent pump was great!! I used that pump in restrooms everywhere-airplane, restaurants, hotel rooms, my brother's reception... I was able to store it in my purse and it makes no noise, so it was very discreet! I never touched my electric pump. I was able to maintain my milk supply and my daughter resumed nursing with no trouble when I returned home. It may take a few tries to get used to it, but it really is worth the money and I think I can express as much milk in the same amount of time, maybe less, than with my electric pump."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"The measurement of water on all warmers are really hard to estimate. This one especially because you couldn't see the fill lines. The timer did go off, but rarely was the bottle I put in it at the end. Pulling the plug in and out was annoying. sometimes the bottle would be too hot and I had to use thongs to take it out. I ended up returning it and now am trying out the Especially for Baby one."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"When I first set this up, I thought to myself that it was not going to be easy. I was WRONG! It ended up being one of the easiest duties of early-stage parenthood. It took less than 30 mins (2 8-min sterilizing times) to completely sterilize 8 big bottles. Two times because the upper tray has to be removed to fit 8 of the 8 oz Dr. Brown bottles in the lower tray. It worked out fine b/c the 2nd time, I was able to fill the lower & upper trays. The process is so simple"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This product is one I couldn't do without. The bottles themself are wonderful, but this sterilizer is a must have. It will be my top pick for shower gifts from now on. It couldn't be easier wash your bottles and put them in the sterilizer and start the microvave and your done. I wish i had had something like this with my 1st child 16 years ago."

Very sturdy!! Highly recommend spending the extra money as this is a product that will last and eventually can be used as a toddler chair.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This is the best bottle system on the market. When your baby is a toddler you can by the sippy spout and use them all the way through toddlerhood.For those of you experiencing leaks I found out that the disposable or adjustable flow nipple (there is a slight blue hue to these nipples) must be used with the disposable or adjustable flow bottles.To make things easier, I threw out my disposable bottle (that I got in the starter set) and made sure that I only bought the clear color nipples (not the ones with the blue hue) and I'm still using these bottles four years later with the sippy spouts.They also make the BEST bottle brush.The best out there if you want a long term commitment."
baby products,feeding,gift sets,1.0,"These bottles really do require a lot of care. I really don't think they make much of a difference in my daughter's gassiness. And...they do leak after time. If I had it to do over, I would register for the Avent bottles."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had. I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed. I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts. I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts. Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?"
baby products,feeding,gift sets,4.0,"I received this off of my registry and have subsequently bought two additional 3 packs of the 6 oz size as I was always washing bottles! Overall the bottles have been a good experience for us. The sleek design is great for the various diaper bags and insulated cooler bag and is easy to handle. The bottle system is easy to clean and there should be no issue of leaks provided the vented disk is inserted back correctly, which is very easy - just run your nail along the inside edge of the vented disk while pressing against the base piece to ensure a snug fit.The only issue that I have with this system is that there is no medium flow nipples. My daughter was sucking so hard and collapsing the nipple at 6 weeks with the Stage 1 nipples and it was beginning to take a long time to feed and she'd wind up frustrated and full of gas. The Stage 2 nipples are too advanced at this point and run very quickly. Before poking any holes or bailing on the systen I tried the Gerber silicon Medium flow replacement nipples (they come in a 6 pack). They fit the bottles and worked like a charm. Now baby is happy and burps like a champ again. I did try one Avent and one Playtex disposable bottle and didn't like either. Give this a try."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I nursed and bottle fed my son at the same time for about 2 months and he had no nipple confusion with the Avent nipples. He would not take Playtex or Gerber nipples after getting used to Avent, though. I guess it all depends on your baby. We used Avent 9oz and 4oz bottles exclusively throughout his first year and they all worked great. As others have said, just don't overtighten the top to avoid leakage. These bottles fit in our First Years bottle warmer with no problems. The only caveat is they are a little pricey."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,I've been using this warmer since my 4mo old was born and I think it's pretty good. I have it down to a science (using Dr Brown's bottles)... 6 minutes for short 8 oz bottles and 7 min for tall 9oz bottles (using refrigerated formula or breastmilk). Shake the bottle before feeding to avoid hot spots. The one thing I really do find annoying is the lack of on/off switch. What I have done is left it plugged in with the knob down to the lowest setting. Not an ideal solution but it beats trying to find the outlet at 3am! Also the cord is way too short. Overall it does the job
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"i put these bottles on my registry through recommendation and high rates on the webstie. however, i am finding that the bottles leak way too much around the nipple area. i followed all the instructions given to me for heating, etc. so far, nothing has changed the situation. i am going to look for another brand bottle. i am wasting so much formula and ruining too many outfits!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I guess to each their own. I have come to the conclusion after reading thousands of reviews on products that some people are never satisfied and will find the smallest thing to gripe about. I REALLY like this seat. My best friend had one and bought one for me after her son got sick from eating in a restaurant highchair. I already had an older seat that was a pain to use because it was in a million pieces and took forever to put together. This seat is 1 piece, 2 if you count the tray. It is compact, portable, light, and takes up hardly any space in my trunk and has a place to put your fingers to carry. The tray snaps on the underside and the straps wind-up into the seat. Have my straps twisted inside...yes, but they fixed themselves and did not pose a threat to my child. Does the tray fit tight..yes, but atleast the food doesn't fall down in his lap. My child doesn't have a big stomach, so the tray isn't too tight on him. Sometimes, I leave the tray off and let him eat off of the table or a plate. The clips on my tray have not broken, but my friends did and they sent her a new tray. The flap/compartment is very shallow but can hold a bib or two. Mine has never popped open like some have complained about. The legs are not hard to put in place, and they add a nice height to the chair. Now, a complaint by a reviewer that has bothered me is..the seat doesn't remove to clean....HELLO....If you go to fold the seat, you can fit a napkin, sponge whatever down there and wipe all of the crumps out (if there are any) and wipe down the seat. If your straps are dirty, take a soapy sponge to those too. I take this seat everywhere with me and would be soooo lost without it. We had a playgroup the other day with 7 moms and 8 kids and I kid you not...ALL 7 OF US CARRIED IN THE EXACT SAME SEAT....THIS ONE!!!! We all laughed and commented on how much we liked this seat!!!!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,I bought many versions of this bottle. All brands because my daughter puked a lot. The doc said it wasn't reflux so we tried EVERY bottle out there. The best ones are the Platex with the drop ins. The angled bottles are TERRIBLE. They are a pain to get the air out of and it's a pain to use since you SUPPOSE to fill it from the bottom. I WILL STICK WITH THE DROP INS.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"When my son was 4 days old I had to pump to get my milk to come in. I rented a Medela electric pump for a month because I did not want to spend the money to purchase the Medela system. Once my rental expired, I purchased the Avent pump. My baby is now 3.5 months old and I pump on average once per day. I have had to pump up to 4 times a day (due to eating way too spicy of a dinner) and the Avent pump is awesome. Because I am breasting from one side per feeding, it is easy for me to use the single hand breast pump. I get between 4 and 6 ounces in 5 minutes...if I'm distracted by something it may take 10 minutes. I found the Medela system to be a little painful and was usually tense right before the pump started up. I have NO pain with the Avent system. It's easy to take to Grandma's house so they can enjoy feeding their grandson too."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I breastfed my son for 6 months. I started giving him a bottle around 2 weeks old. People kept telling me not to do that because he would get confused. But with the Avent system, I had no problems. The nipples are designed to control the flow of the milk, so if you are breastfeeding and bottlefeeding, the baby will respond to both. The milk comes out slower than other bottles, so the baby still has to work for it, like it does on the breast. Plus, the base of the nipples is larger, making the baby open their mouth wider to latch on to it...just like in breastfeeding. No confusion!!I found the pump to be awesome. I had had trouble producing milk into the pump, as long as I drank enough fluids during the day. I used to take it in the car with me and my record was pumping 7 oz of milk in 7 mins. That's an ounce a minute! I never had any trouble pumping at least 5 oz at any given time.I've recommended this system to many of my friends and I recommend it to YOU also.I like the fact you can pump right into the liners and then freeze them as soon as you're finished pumping. I never boiled the nipples or heated the bottles on the stove. I alwasys washed them in hot water and would take a bottle out of the fridge and run it under hot water. This was warm enough for him to drink it.ONce my son was over 6 months old, I switched to the larger 9oz bottles that don't have liners and we used those with formula. These nipples have 4 holes in the top for faster flow, as the baby can take more milk then.I completely love this system."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I started out renting a hospital grade breast pump from the hospital. It hurt! I bought an evenflow electric. It hurt and it was SLOW! I bought the Avent pump. It was a godsend! I could pump the same amount, if not more, in the same amount of time as I did with the hospital grade one, with NO PAIN! I was a 56G before my breast reduction and this worked wonders with me. I have told my husband that we are buying this again. I don't know if I will be able to breast feed after my surgery (I am pregnent now), but I have faith that if anything will do it, this pump will help! I have become Avent's biggest fan, from the pump, to the bottles, to the sippys. It is a wonderful company!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"I bought these cups because I had succes with the bottles and the breast pump. These cups are okay. Liquid gets trapped between the parts so if you are switching from juice to milk throughout the day you would have to take it apart each and everytime to clean it. The pieces are small and clear so they are difficult to find if put in a drawer or even the dish rack. These are also not good to send with your child to relatives or on play dates. You would have to show them how to take it apart and put it back together. It is easy, but I have found that grandma and even dad still put the pieces on in the wrong order, they loose the pieces or they don't put them on at all. If you are going to purchase these cups I would suggest buying additional spouts for easy changing and just in case they get lost. Other than that they are spill proof and easy for toddlers to hold."
baby products,feeding,gift sets,3.0,"Well, I like a few others read the reviews and thought great I'll try these. I too had a problem with nipple collapse, and I never put the nipple in the mircrowave. We tried both stage one and stage two with our newborn he collapsed both, plus he would scream for hours after he ate. We switched his bottle and he is much better. We also had a problem with the bottles leaking. For those who have problems with air Dr. Browns is what we are using now. They are more tedious to clean and you have to use the special disk when traveling so that they don't leak, but it is well worth it if you have a baby who screams because they have so much air in their tummies."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"The lack of an on/off switch is not a big deal. This bottle warmer has a light that goes on and stays on till it reaches a certain temperature then goes off, then on again when it starts cooling down. This allows it to maintain a constant temperature. What bothered me is that after it heats the bottle and the light goes off I would expect the milk to stay at a constant temperature and not to continue overheating...and it overheated everytime. I could not change the baby and leave the milk in it for an extra minute or 2 or it would get way too hot. Now on power level number 2 it was pretty much the same thing it just took longer to heat and with a crying baby every minute seems like forever. Number 1 is way too weak unless you let the milk sit there and know you will use it in a half hour then it is just warm. I returned mine and switched to powder formula and use sterilized room temperature water. No warming, no headaches and my baby loves it."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"The bottles are very easy to clean, they have wide necks, which makes it extremely easy to put formula in without making a mess, but the nine or so I have all leak. I contacted Avent, who told not to tighten them all way, among various other things, which still did not help much. I actually believed I knew how to put a bottle together before this. The leaky top outweighs all the good factors about this bottle, I threw them out, and won't buy another avent bottle again."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"This steam sterilizer was a waste of money. I used it once, and it left spots of water all over everything. It might have been sterile, but it seemed dirty. It also took forever to dry. I've been much more satisfied washing the bottles, etc... with hot, soapy water, or, occasionally, in the dishwasher. I didn't think I'd wash the baby's stuff by hand, but I've been happiest with the results when I do this. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it probably does sterilize the bottles. On the other hand, I wish I had saved my money, since I don't use it at all."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"First off, I absolutely swear by the Dr. Brown's bottles. Simple physics tells you that these things WORK! My happy newborn is proof. Somewhere along the line, for some strange reason, the people who make the Dr. Brown's bottles decided the new-style, skinny bottles and redesigned nipple were what worked best and what everyone wanted. I, for one, say ""Go Back! These are not as good as the original wide-mouth bottles.""First complaint, the new nipple style. Why? It doesn't resemble a breast anymore than the old style. Furthermore, my little girl can almost suck the whole nipple in her mouth, lips rubbing the plastic bottle ring. The old style nipple would have my girl sucking on the nipple part and her lips against the ""areola""-part. It seemed to work very well and transition to breast was not a problem. So, why mess with something that works? New nipple-BAD, old nipple-GOOD.Second, the skinny design is a pain, in my opinion. The much larger but shorter older-style bottles were a breeze to clean. Almost any sponge or brush could easily swish inside the cavernous interior. The skinny bottles only take a skinny brush and then spray you with soap suds when the bristles pop out of the narrow mouth of the bottle. Plus the long, skinny vent tube and smaller nipples on the new-style bottle are much harder to clean as well. The only reason I can imagine why they did it was because people thought the short and wide bottles were hard to hold. It doesn't cut it with me, especially since the very popular Avent bottles are similiar in size to the old-style Dr. Brown's. Plus, the old-style rubber vent/gasket would be a nice press-fit into the bottle where the new-style rests on top of the bottle lip. Not as good, IMHO. Tall & skinny-BAD, short & wide-GOOD!There you have it; my opinion. Take it for what it's worth. I prefer the old-style (I'm buying more before they are no longer available) but the new-style FUNCTIONS almost as good as the original, except for the new nipple design. One things for sure, wide or skinny, I will never use another bottle... EVER!Rmpl"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We spent $80 on a high chair with all the bells and whistles, but my daughter is so tiny she does not fit in it well. We got the Fold and Go Booster for travel and have ended up using it for her everyday high chair for over a year now while the expensive one sits in a corner. The storage area on the back of the seat is useless, but unneccesary. This chair has been perfect for us and I would definitely reccomend it."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,We recently bought three of these boosters for our daughters. We had just purchased a new dining set and the chairs were too low for our girls to eat comfortably at the table. The chemical finish on the booster migrated on to our wooden chairs and ruined the finish. The finish became gummy and any attempt to take off the gumminess took the finish along with it. We will have to get these brand new chairs refinished at our own expense. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy these boosters for wooden chairs.

ARD is a really sucky thing to be born with, but it's things like this which allow us some relief. I'm on a prescription that works great, but sometimes when I eat an excessive amount of greasy,spicy, and saucy food, well that's when I reach for this. It stops the reflux fast so that I can get through the night. I definately recommend this. Bigtime baby!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"Having tried many Jasmine blends, I found the Dragon Pearl blend basically the same as regular Jasmines but for the novelty of the leaves being rolled into tight little dried &quot;pearls&quot; which unfurl when infusing.

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I have been using the Avent Microwave Steam Sterilizer for 5 months now, and I am completely satisfied. I am a breastfeeding and working mom, and I use the Isis pump daily which means I wash my pump daily. I hated running the dishwasher every night with 3 things in it, and I always had to wash dishwasher soap residue off the pump after it had finished, so I switched over to hand washing the pump and sterilizing with this sterilizer. After a good washing in the sink with dish soap and 4 minutes in the microwave, my pump is clean and sterile, ready to pack for the next day."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I puchased these bottles after speaking with a lactation consultant. We had difficulties breastfeeding and had to start supplementing with formula. My son was eating almost 2oz at six days old--way more than he should have been. This is because the bottles we were using let him eat too fast and I didn't know any better. After switching we were able to get him to slow down and have had fewer gas problems. I have had the bottle leak but it easily fixed by rescrewing on the top (I was relieved to see that other people had the same problem--I blamed it on being tired). When we feed our son, we were told to have him sitting up as straight as possible without his head flopping over and hold the bottle horizontal so that only half of the nipple is full."

baby products,feeding,gift sets,3.0,These bottles worked well for us with our newborn (using size 2 nipples) until we purchased a bottle warmer. The warmer heats using steam which caused the seal on the bottom to come loose. This led to a leaky bottle and a very frustrated mom and baby. I've since switched to Dr. Brown's bottles. I like those bottles much better
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This bottles have a unique design that helps prevent your baby from swallowing air, thus preventing gas. They work! The odd vent system really does work, and allows the bottle to break into more pieces for easy cleaning. They are also bent, which helps feed your baby more easily. I wish they came in an 8 oz size, rather than 6, but otherwise, they have a good selection of color choices and are an excellent choice for feeding your baby."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I thought this was a good idea however there was alot I didn't like about it. First the cooler part did not stay cold enough though the whole night so I didn't trust to store breastmilk in it. Second the warm did not work with the bottles I tried. It would take several times to get me milk warm with the Playtex disposables, and Playtex VentAire. I could only get the bottles I pumped in to heat with it. It took the 8oz measure of heating to heat a 4oz bottle that I pumped in. That was the only bottle it would heat. I would heat the milk in the pump bottle and pour it into the other bottles. This is not easy with a screaming baby that wants to be fed. It just wasn't worth the time so I took it back. If you choose to use the regular bottles or maybe the Avent bottles (not disposables)then it would probably be worth it for the first couple of months when you getting up at night frequently. Just make sure you milk is really cold before storing it in the cooler over night."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I registered for these bottles based on the positive review a friend of mine gave to me. The day we came home from the hospital with our newborn daughter, she had no problems taking to these bottles. Plus ,I love the fact that I don't have to worry about properly cleaning out bottles and sterilizing them all the time as the drop in liners are pre-sterilized. And the one thing that most of my girlfriends cant' believe is that after being 7 1/2 weeks old, my daughter has only spit up 2 times, and she is eating so well that she is sleeping thru the night...in fact we don't even use a diaper or burp cloth to burp her many times after eating. She still has the typical gas that any newborn has, but doesn't have any trouble eating from these bottles. I would highly recommend them to any mom and wouldn't use anything else!"

baby products,feeding,gift sets,1.0,"My wife and I bought the VentAires when our first child was born. They appeared to be top of the line. They certainly were marketed that way and priced that way. We found the nipple flow to be way too slow and they leaked! No one likes a leaky bottle at 3AM on a December night in New England. It is also difficult to tell if the infant/new born is actually taking the formula. We ended up donating the six VentAires that we bought to a local daycare center and bought EvenFlo bottles, which have been great (and less money). All-in-all, we give this product a POOR grade and state, in our opinion, that they are not worth the extra money."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I have tried lots of pumps since my baby was in the NICU at birth. Once I had established some supply with the hospital grade machines (Medela Classic and the Ameda version) I was able to use this a pump for working part-time. The bag is much more stylish and comfortable than the shoulder bag option Pump-in-Style. I love that it is a backpack since I already am toting a shoulder style diaper bag and often have my baby in a front carrier or side sling.This is not a hospital grade pump, but it is the best portable electric pump on the market. Replacement parts are available though Medela, some breastfeeding shops and lactation consultants. Medela's customer service is great- I had a faulty piece of tubing and the company overnighted me a new one no questions asked. My only complaint is the quality of the included bottles and breast shields/horns. The plastic is opaque and cheap. For such a high quality pump I would expect more. I ended up getting the Avent adapter and pumping into the Avent bottles or into the Medela bags. I do not like that I can not see the milk in the horns very well- hard, clear plastic would be an improvement. All in all this a great pump for high use for moms with decent supplies. If you have a NICU baby or a supply problem I do encourage you to rent the Medela Classic before switching to a portable electric. I have used this pump for 6 months and am confident that I will be able to use it if I ever have another baby. I hear some moms shying away from the $280 price and trying a First Years or an Evenflo portable pump instead to save money. Don't bother- every mom I know who did that ended up buying a Medela after having problems with the cheaper pumps. After all, this is a sensitive area and you don't need a cheap pump breaking or giving you sore nipples! The extra money now will save you money later since you will be satisfied in the long run with this pump."

It turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made since becomming a parent. I love this seat, and so does my daughter! It is safe and it is so easy to just fold up and take along when we go visit the grandparents. The tray is dishwasher safe, which is a really great feature. I'm not sure why the one reviewer was trying to tighten the straps by using the retracting mechanism underneath the seat. All you have to do is pull on the ends of the straps and they tighten. My friends have all ditched their huge annoying high chairs for this booster seat. My daughter is 10 months old now and we're still loving it!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I sarted using these bottles when my daughter was 6 wks. old. I tried other bottles, mostly cheaper ones, and my daughter would be so fussy after eating, have formula all over her, and spit up everything shortly afterwards. I switched to these bottles when I found out my daughter had acid reflux. I had to add cereal to her formula so the Stage 2 nipples worked perfectly for the situation. She is now 12 months and I still use these bottles. I have switched the nipples, yet again, to the Wal-Mart brand and they still work, no collapsing or leaking. These really are great bottles and will definately use these for my second child."

Imagine my surprise when my 10 pound son not only had an acid reflux problem, but colic as well. My days and nights were hell and I couldn't even enjoy my new baby. The dr. prescribed zantac for the acid reflux (by the way if your fussy one little seems like he's choking during feedings and you're using newborn x-tra slow flow nipples &amp; needs to be upright ALL the time - get him checked out!!!) The zantac cured some of the symptons, but we still were seeing a lot of the colic/ gas symptons. He was still one unhappy baby! So far it's been 2 weeks on the Dr. Brown bottles &amp; not even one colic episode!!! I've actually been getting sleep and so has my son! He's burping and tooting even on his own.

It's really one of the rare protein bars I actually look forward to eating.The protein isnt that much but its a good meal replacement bar if you're trying to lose fat. There is a lot of sugar in it unfortunately so hopefully its not too high on the glycemic scale.I'd definately recommend this if you need a low calorie protein bar thats sweet, tastes great, and has the feel of a rice crispy treat."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I've had this bottle warmer for 5 months now and have to say it is the fastest for $18.00. Yes, you do have to adjust the amount of water used for different types and thicknesses of bottles, but when you have a screaming and hungry child this bottle warmer only takes about 4 minutes for an 9 oz. Avent bottle filled with 8 oz. of COLD formula from the fridge.I use Avent bottles and they are thicker plastic and require the water level to be one notch above the recommended level for a full 8oz bottle.My one real gripe about this bottle warmer is that they don't make a car adapter like the Phillips Bottle Warmer found at Target. The First Years should consider adopting this idea for this particular bottle warmer, it would be great!"

After 3 weeks of running the hot water over the bottle at 7 minutes each over 12 times a day for my newborn, I realized that running hot water for more than 1 full hour a day...my hot water bill was going to be outrageous. So I decided we needed a solution. I went to the store and bought this amazing product afer reading the reviews here online. Well of course you have to stand by it while it works. You have to do that if it is running under hot water or on the stove anyway!!! It is great! You fill it to the appropriate water level, put the bottle in, and press the button. When it is done it shuts off. You take it out, shake it up, test it, and you are ready to go in less than 3 minutes. I also noticed that some of these reviews that gave bad ratings are from 2002? The current model is much more advanced and improved than the last model."

Also, it only fits 4 oz. bottles, 8 oz. bottles stick out of the top! I have found that if I use this product along with a thermal pouch, it will keep a bottle warm for several hours, especially if I use it straight from the boiling water. I do have a problem with it turning itself 'on' by itself before I am ready for it to heat up. The stick that you bend must be pretty sensitive to every bump.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"What I was hoping for was something quick, simple, filling, and with a reasonably decent taste. This is not five-star restaurant eating, people, but I don't care. These meals are just what I hoped they would be.The shells-and-cheese meals suit me just fine, and I intend to try other products in this &quot;Hot Meal Options&quot; series. The thing I like about the Slim-Fast plan is its simplicity. I keep several of the shakes in my car and just get a cup of ice at fast food restaurants or a convenience store and then pour my shake over that.The thing I dislike about most snack bars and most diet shakes (including those made by Slim-Fast) is that they are NAUSEATINGLY sweet. Two Slim-Fast shake flavors that I actually like, however, are the orange-pineapple and the apple-cranberry; the rest of them are like drinking liquid candy, and the meal bars/snack bars are even worse.Now with these Hot Meal Options (which can substitute for a shake), I have basically replaced two meals a day with a shake for breakfast and a shake or a meal for lunch. This, combined with a moderate dinner and regular simple exercise (again--nothing too elaborate--just some situps, pushups, etc., maybe three times a week), is actually working for me. I've been losing ca. 1-2 pounds per week steadily over the past two months--even with an occasional small &quot;splurge&quot; or two from time to time. I've gone from 190 lb. to ca. 180 lb over the last 6 to 8 weeks--and it hasn't been torture! The most amazing thing to me is that my appetite has *decreased* over these two months. It's just a matter of getting used to eating less.The problem with most diet plans is that they're too darned complicated or preparation-intensive. The Slim-Fast plan is simple and easy, and it is working well for me. I only wish these hot meals were a little healthier (less sodium, fewer additives, etc.)."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I debated whether or not to go with Avent because of the mixed reviews. I am so glad we decided to try it. I have the Avent Isis pump, which I love. I just pump directly in the bottle (or Avent breast milk container) and put a sealing disk on. When its time for our son to eat I either thaw the frozen milk, or heat the refrigerated milk, put a nipple on the bottle and feed him. Its so convenient! I also pump into a disposible milk bag and use it with the Avent disposible bottle. I don't care much for the Avent bags, but I love the Gerber ones. They are self standing, and less hassle to deal with. We use the bottles to give him formula too, and they work well.When have never had any trouble with leaking or anything from these bottles. I'm not sure what we're doing different from other people. I have read advice from others saying not to screw the tops on too tight. We have tried to follow that advice and have no problems so far. I also highly recommend the electric sterilizer, and the bottle warmer. I just can't say enough good things about these products!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"The stage one nipple is worthless. After watching my baby (who is a really good sucker) get frustrated and not seem to be able to get anything out of the bottle in every feeding with the stage 1 nipples, I looked a little closer at it. The hole seemed so tiny, so I tried it myself, and I couldn't even get anything through it. I bought the stage 2 nipples just to try, and what a difference they made in my newborn!The bottles leak from the bottom, even after I realized it and took extra care to make sure that the vent in the bottom was inserted correctly and screwed on tightly. Very frustrating in the middle of the night!!The only good thing about them is that everything comes apart to throw in the dishwasher, and the bottles are dry at the end of the cycle because the bottom is removed. I just let the individual little pieces air dry and reassemble -- and hope that they don't leak the next time...I complained to Playtex, and they weren't extremely helpful or nice, and made it seem as though it was my baby that couldn't figure out how to use the bottle!! Imagine hearing that as a new mom! They did send me a couple coupons to replace only some of the nipples for stage 2 replacements -- not for all of the bottles I had bought.I personally would not recommend these bottles, and I definitely will never buy another one. Just too frustrating."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Finally I found a warmer that actually warmed bottles in the length of time it reported. I had tried another and returned it since I could heat water in the microwave and set the bottle in it in shorter time then it took to heat the warmer. However, I purchased the Avent warmer because I was using the Avent bottles and it seemed sensible. Our bedroom is upstairs and we have a refrigerator in the room, so it seemed sensible to have a warmer too, since then we wouldn't have to go downstairs in the middle of the night to heat a bottle. The Avent warmer did wonderfully. Bottles are warmed perfectly if the warmer is used as indicated. On a few occasions, they actually became too warm because we fell asleep and they sat in the warmer too long. The only downfall is that the warmer doesn't have an automatic shut-off, and if it is forgotten, all the water will evaporate. This has happened to us on a few occasions, and luckily it still works!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I don't know much about coffee but I saw this on Amazon and thought I'd take a chance and give it a try. WoW! I don't think I could ever go back to Starbucks. It is really strong but with no bitterness. I have a friend who knows a few things about coffee and she was really impressed. I totally recommend this product.
baby products,feeding,gift sets,5.0,"I have used this with both of my babies and would recommend it to anyone. I have tried many many different bottles until I discovered this one. I used the microwave to heat bottles all the time (I know they say not to, but...) and it was fine even after a year of use. It never leaked either."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"I went out and bought this booster seat for my 21 month old daughter. My 3 year old son has a booster seat as well which is a cheaper model (still being sold), and other than being a crumb trap which has to be taken apart to be cleaned it is very useful, it gets him up high so he can sit at the table with us and it allows me to strap him in so he can not get out during meal time. However this Healthy Care Booster Seat is almost worthless. It does not elevate my daughter up high enough to eat at the table (her height is in the 90%), so I have to use the tray. But unfortunately the tray is so small, I can not fit any of my daughters child size plastic plates on it, so I have to put her food on the tray provided, which she can take apart and throw. This chair is easier to clean, but not giving me anything I need."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"Don't waste your money - spend more to get a better pump!!!This pump was great in the beginning, but recently it just gave out. I had my son in November and primarily nursed him until I came back to work in the beginning of March. I only used the pump upon occassion or to express some milk for his daily cereal feedings. The pump is small and compact and I thought it was great for portability. I've been using it about 3 times a day with the exception of the weekends and I've noticed that the suction just is not as good as it was when I first got it. I've also noticed that while pumping the milk will remain in the bottom of the barrel of the breast sheild, bubble up and leak out where the motor screws into it instead of going into the bottle. I've only been using this pump since November (it's now March) and it died on me today. I now have to go out and buy a new pump or rent one."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I am a department manager of a baby retail store and I spend most of my day educating moms and other associates on items such as bottles and breastpumps. I have been a manager at the store for a year but before that I was a full time nanny for a baby who used Avent bottles. He was the happiest baby in the world and I guess if I wanted to, I could have attributed that to his using avent. However, on many many occasions, I would buy him bottles so that I could keep some at my house and I never bought avent, only cheap ones and he was still a very very happy guy after using these. I know that he was not a happy baby because of Avent, but because that was his character. He was not prone to gas nor was he colicy so it did not matter what bottle I used. I have spent the last year talking to parents all day about what bottle they used and what their friends are telling them to use (if they were expectant parents who had no other children). At least 80% of the time they were told to use Avent bottles. However, their friends never have any idea why exactly they love them, they only know that they use them and that must make them the best. Even people who hate that they leak so much and have colicy babies will still tell friends that they must use Avent, seemingly because they use them. I agree that they do work good for some babies but almost always, the babies are the ones like I took care of who will use anything. Trust me on this one, no one ever gets past me in my store with any bottle without me asking them questions about how they like them. A mom will say &quot;I love them, they are the best&quot; and then go on to tell me (after more questioning) that they leak sometimes and that her baby has been having a little problem with gas and then she will throw a box of Mylicon gas drops in her cart and move on. Please, do not recommend them to your friends just because you used them. You can tell your friends how they worked for you, but be honest about it and dont make your friends feel like they are the only bottles they should ever buy if they love their babies. If you are expecting your first baby, dont be afraid to buy or register for one or two of these bottles, but also buy or register for a couple Dr. Browns, (which hold true to the &quot;hype&quot; 95% of the time) and maybe even a couple playtex disposables. The later two are great for colic but ESPECIALLY Dr. Browns. Just read those reviews too before you decide.Happy Bottle hunting."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have tried most of the major health bars, including energy bars, protein bars, and low-carb bars. The EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control Nutrition Bar, Chocolate Cream Pie is, in my opinion, the best tasting. I have one every morning for breakfast and I actually look forward to it. They're THAT good. The consistency is kinda goofy at first, but after you get past that (or if you have eaten health bars before), they're quite good. Don't know about the whole &quot;impact carbs&quot; thing, but the protein/fat/carb mix is right for a healthy lifestyle."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I have four kids under the age of Five, so we have been experts in the bottle arena.The problem the tall thin bottles provided, was the cleaning aspect. Tight ridges hard to clean, and you needed the special brush to do it.The advent bottles seemed to fix that problem.. I could fit a lot of my hand in them and they were easier to pour stuff into, but they did leak. This, and they dont fit on my favorite pumps- The Medela Brands.It's 50/50 to me."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I was so excited when I recieved these bottles in the mail and tried them that same day, I was hoping to see results as described by some of the other reviews, but no such luck. My son still spits up, not as much though maybe it has reduced by 20%. Not every baby is the same so if you have a bubby that is spitting up try them, they might work for you."

I have purchased a few different types of espresso beans and these Starbucks beans have been the best. Cup after cup, it has been smooth and tasty, not bitter like some.

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"My son is only three months old and this kit has already been sooo useful. We immediately used the gas drops when we came home from the hospital and my little boy had awful gas pains. They are miraculous. Then a few weeks later he had a cold and the saline nose drops helped his breathing tremendously. The nasal aspirator included in the kit is infinitely better than the one I received from the hospital, the one in my baby grooming kit or the gerber one I also received at my shower. It's soft on the little nose and easy to use.I used the teething gel on my 9 year old when one of her teeth was loose and it worked for her.I've also used the cold remedy on the advice of my pediatrician and it also worked very well.This is a highly recommended product!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love these bottles. I express my breast milk & feed my baby with these bottles. They are easy to use & clean. All you really have to clean is the nipples. It gets the air out of the bottle, so baby get less air in her belly plus less gas. I recommend using the drop ins. They are a little bit more money, but they are fast and convenient."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Give it a try, may not taste fabulous but it is nutritious, filling and as a good thing to have to help curb carb cravings.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"This massager really disappointed me. It's very hard to handle for more than a few minutes, as it's handle is not shaped well for hands. Worst of all, it is VERY heavy. I have large, strong hands, so I didn't expect that to be a problem.It is also very loud. Maybe I can sell it!"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,2.0,"I like these cough drops. They taste good, and they soothe the throat. I take them whenever I have a cold and they help me feel better.However...The other day (while not currently sick) as I was going to bed I wanted a little something to suck on, and spotted the bag still on my dresser from when I was sick a few months before. I grabbed one because they do taste good.Well, I'd been laying in bed about 5 minutes when I discovered that I felt the need to cough. And again 30 seconds later. And again. And again. I took out the cough drop and took a drink of water and everything smoothed right out.Later, just to test my theory, I tried another one. Same result.I'm not drawing any scientific conclusions, this is just my experience.*****Final Thoughts*****At first glance these were great because they are so soothing. But for some reason, they seem to actually MAKE me cough. Maybe it's supposed to do that, maybe it's just a way to sell more cough drops.As for me, I'll stick with generic-brand menthol-eucalyptus."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"i've researched and tested many different product for my baby's first high chair. i really wanted safe, solid, and easy to clean one and this is the one i decided.i've been using it for last two months and i'm very satisfied. first of all, some say that this is hard to clean but this is the EASIEST to clean in the market. the other high chairs come with ruffles and fabrics that are hard to clean but the leatherette, i just wipe with baby wipe or if stained and dried, use little cleaner. of course, plastic booster might be easier to clean and takes less room, but my 7months son would easily have safety problems on a booster.it's very stable chair and very, very safe for the little one. i love the fact that it's 5 point harness so that my son cannot pull forward (he's constantly trying to pull himself up from his stroller, carseat, etc.) and have major accident.also, it's easy to store away when it's not in use and tray is very stable that the baby cannot move it but easy for me to remove. the top tray is removable and could put in the dishwasher.some people are concerned with the height of the tray for the baby and i've used it since my baby was 5months and i didn't notice that the tray is high. i sometimes use this chair when i show my baby his dvds and it works great also. The reclining seat and adjustable height is a wonderful feature. highly recommend it."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I used this Avent Sterilizer from day one for all bottles I used (Avent, Playtex and Gerber) as well as for the breast pump plus all pacifiers and teething toys. It's just great and takes no time/effort. I didn't want to put the baby's stuff in the dishwasher and have to wait the full cycle before I can use things again. It was perfect when I had to travel out of town and pump milk away from the baby because it's small/light enough to fit in any travel case, plus all I needed was a microwave.My baby is now 9 months and I intend to keep using this for any sterilizing need at any time. This might be one of the very few items that I will not give away after the baby has grown."

My husband broke out in a rash all over....I mean ALL OVER.....even the unmentionables. He itched every where. We both experience weight gain and bloatedness. NO WEIGHT LOSS at all. We bought this at GNC for $59.00, not knowing it was here. SO Price doesn't always mean better product. If there was a NO STAR catagory this wouldn't even qualify for that."

I had originally bought the standard bottles and have switched to wide neck bottles. My child can hold it better and it is ALOT EASIER to wash ladies!!!

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We keep our booster in the car. It has become one of the most helpful items! When we go to restaurants, I don't have to worry about the cleanliness of public boosters. I use ours. It is also nice, because it fits in booths, so I have been able to put our child in the seat next to me. It's nice to have when traveling too, since it practically serves as a high chair. All I have to do is strap it to a seat, and our child can eat at table, or use the tray, for her to feed herself! I must say, I really enjoy this product!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"After using a Medela Pump in Style for three weeks, I was not happy with the amount of milk I was able to express. Also, it was getting pretty painful, so I purchased the First Years pump. The First Years pump is much more comfortable than the Medela pump. Also, I am able to express one to two more ounces per breast each time I pump.I have read the poor reviews, but have not experienced any problems. It would be nice if the pump fit regular sized bottles, but since I pour the milk into storage bags anyway, it's not too big an inconvenience. I definitely suggest saving your money and purchasing this pump."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"This is the only thermometer we use at our house, my husband and I included. It is so easy. Just be sure to hold the top of the ear straight up then insert the probe, this should give you the right angle. As for the probe covers, you can use any generic cover. I bought a package of Walgreens brand covers and they work just as well. They are not the exact same and do look different, but looks and functionality are two separate things. Get over the cover issue and go to Walgreens or any drug store. Please don't let the other reviews scare you. This is a great product."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I am a first time mother, who bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the best. My child was really gassy. He also ended up wasting a lot of his food each time because the nipple is way too fast for a newborn. I was really disappointed with these bottles. I switched to the Playtex disposable bottles, and he has been much happier since I have. Also, he gets every bit of food I give him now."
baby products,feeding,gift sets,4.0,"After buying nearly every bottle on the market, I finally tried these bottles. I was nervious about them because of all the reviews, but these are the only bottles that worked for my son. The problem we were having with every other bottles was that even with the slowest flow nipple it was too fast for him. With therse bottles he can control the rate of flow and doesn't end up gaggin on the formula. It did take a while for him to finish the bottle at first but now (at 2 months) he can finish 6 ounces in 15 minutes and he isn't covered in formula. The ONLY drawback is the cleaning of all the pieces. Overall, a great bottle."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I would recommend getting breastmilk storage bags instead. If you don't carefully tighten the lids and get them on exactly right, they leak everywhere, including on your baby when you are feeding them."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"Avent claims to be ""most like breast,"" but I beg to differ. My son has been breast fed since birth (now 4 months old). I came back to work after 6 weeks of maternity leave so my husband and I need to find bottles that were compatible with breastfeeding and tried out many different kinds. The problem with Avent is that the nipple is so hard and makes latching on harder for my son. We still use them because we have 6 of them, but we prefer the Playtex nurser system with the sylicone nipples. They are by far the closest to breast on the market."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I registered for these bottles for my shower. They are horrible. They leak all over the place and my poor son gets soaking wet. I have to stop and change him, meanwhile he's crying because he's hungry. I had gotten the Playtex Ventair bottles too and they are so much better. They do not leak and prevent air from getting in my son's belly. I went out and bought more. Never again will I use Avent bottles...waste of money."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"My family loves this high chair. I have a very big two year old (37 lbs, 38 inches), and he still fits comfortably. I have it in white. The straps are a little difficult to clean, but the seat couldn't be easier to clean. It whipes well for simple messes, and comes of easily for more thorough washes in the washing machine. I love the reclining features, which especially came in handy when he was younger and would sometimes fall asleap in the chair. I also love that the chair adjusts up and down to so many levels, making in easy on Mom and Dad's back and safe for my son who now loves to climb in and out of his chair. The large tray makes it great for using the chair for so many activities such as arts and crafts and puzzles. And the tray is simple to put on and off with one hand. I also love that my son hasn't figured out how to take the tray off by himself yet, which he has with the chair at my parent's house. The chair is also very easy to fold up and take along on trips. And being on wheels makes it easy to move to any area of the house. My bigest complaint is that my parents had tried to purchase this chair several times, and each time there was a defect with the arms. The tray wouldn't go on right. I think it was probably a problem with shipping and handling or how the store was storing the boxes that bent the arms out of place. All in all, I have been very happy with this chair, and I am looking to get another one now that twins are on the way."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We bought this chair for our baby's daily trips to Grandma's house and it's a joy to use.

It is very discreet, where you don't have to carry around an armload of supplies and it is simple to use, not complicated at all. It was at a very good price and it suctions very well. Haven't had a single complaint about it yet! Why spend so much money? This works just as well as all those other high-priced pumps! AND it fits most bottles that I've used!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I was given both the Avent bottles and the Dr. Browns bottles as a gift for my baby. A friend of mine recommended I use the Dr. Browns bottles because she found them to be so much better. I tried them and fell in love.

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I have three nosiy roommates and loud neighbors. I used to sleep with a fan on every night to drown out their sounds. I finally wanted to try something new and purchased this product. It's wonderful. I also use it while studying to get rid of distant noisy distractions. I love all the sounds (except the heartbeat). The crystal ball was a little weird to me, but is surprisingly kind of nice with the different colors. Also, the whole product is a perfect size to fit on your nightstand. I completely reccomend it!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I've been using these bottles for almost a year now and yes, THEY DO LEAK! I had to laugh when reading the reviews from all the ""experts"" that know how to put the lid on without the bottle leaking. Well I trusted those reviews when I bought these bottles thinking ""oh, how hard can it be to put a LID on a BOTTLE?""Well let me tell you - NOTHING I do keeps them from leaking. And I have a degree in mechanical engineering so you'd THINK I could at the very least, put a lid on a bottle. WRONG! I tighten them, they leak. I don't tighten them - they leak. I put a brand new nipple in the bottle - they STILL leak! NO MATTER WHAT I DO - THEY LEAK!!!!!!Nothing is more frustrating than being away from home with a hungry baby and a bottle that won't quit leaking. You end up with a drenched, cranky baby and drenched clothes on yourself as well. Save yourself the headaches and don't get your baby attached to these wretched and overly priced bottles!!!! My other three kids all used plain old evenflo bottles and I never had a single problem.There should not be a ""trick"" to putting a bottle together so it doesn't leak!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I was so happy to find a booster tray with two trays in one. How many times has your baby eaten, made a disaster on the tray and on theirselves. Sometimes you don't have the energy to clean both baby and chair. The top tray is removable and can be cleaned later while the blue base tray is ready for the next meal!! Once they are both dirty just run them in the dishwasher.Another perk is that you can take the white tray, have your babies meal already prepared with the lid and store in the 'fridge.This booster is extremley portable (ex. grandma's, friends homes, restaurants).The boosters seat back even folds down so the chair it is attached to still can be pushed in all the way. Perfect for parents who still like a house that looks like thier own and not completley taken over by baby stuff.Above all else, our daughter loves it! She is comfortable, and she loves sitting along side us during meals. Great booster chair!!!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I think these are the best! They are simple to clean and simple to use, and you know which parts belong to which bottles! I use the Avent bottles as well as the Dr Brown's bottles. When my mom is babysitting my baby, I put breastmilk in an Avent bottle, so it is easy for her to replace the bottle cap with the nipple, and when my baby is at home and I want his daddy to spend a little one on one time with him, he uses the Dr Brown's bottles. The Dr Brown's bottles are a little more complicated for other people to try and figure out, but the Avent bottles are a cinch! I recommend the Avent bottles, they are big, but they are worth it!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I began using this pump right after my son was born. He would not latch on, and was not giving up. We used the Medela pump and it gave me enough milk to feed him using a syringe and tubing. I didn't want him to have a bottle this early in the game since they can have nipple confusion. I used the pump and trying to let him get use to nursing for about the first week. He would nurse then I would pump every three hours. Finally when he began nurse really well I stopped pumping as much. I was also worried about how much milk he was receive. But as a nurse I should have remembered as long as he is having 10-12 wet diapers a day, he is doing great. This pump was also helpful when I went back to work one day a week. I would pump every four hours and it worked wonderfully. I could pump 20-24 ounces in a 8 hour shift. If you double pump it works better since when you begin to have your ""let down"" you don't have to stop the one breast from leaking. You just let them both go. Just don't forget when you are with your baby nurse as much as possible. Even if you feel like you just a nursing machine. It will keep you supply up and keep your baby happy and healthy. My son is 14 month old and weighs 28.4 lbs, all good fat, not the overfeed formula baby kind. The formula industry can never change the scientific proof Breast is best!! All vitamins are included :)"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I used these bottles with my second child, and they leaked everywhere. I read some of the other reviews, and I did read the directions correctly and screw the bottles on right, and they still leaked. They also leaked when my husband did it, and when my sister used them for her baby. I do like the bottles, but I hated the fact that it was hit or miss when it came to leaking. The bottles would leak all over my daughter, and she would get extremely upset, and I would get frustrated. I even contacted Avent, and they weren't helpful at all. I would recommend trying another kind if possible."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"My friend has this unusual massager. When it's first used it feels creepy, but after that it feels good. REALLY good.There is one problem though. The extensions are made of wires that can bend easily. If something happens to it and the extensions get bent, it will look deformed (even after you try to bend them back to their origonal placements). It will still work though.It will give you the weirdest feeling, but not a bad feeling. It is hard to explain how it makes you feel."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,The motor weakened after a mere three months. I could barely get one ounce at a sitting. I could hand express more in less time. (...)P>I am now renting a pump and get great results.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,This booster is wonderful! My son has cerebral palsy and he can't sit in the wooden highchairs that most restaurants have-he slips and slides in them. In this booster he sits very comfortably and it holds him in to where he doesn't slide around. He usually uses it w/out the tray-he enjoys being scooted up to the table. I would definitely suggest this to anyone-especially for a child w/ special needs. It stays in our van and when we go out to eat or to family functions or church dinners we just take it in and set him in it and everyone is happy!!! This was truly a Godsend for us!

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,I used Avent bottles for my now 2 1/2 year old and found them great and horrible. They were great for mixing powder formula right in the bottle and very easy to clean because of the wide opening. The silicon nipples hold up well after many uses and even hold up well in the dishwasher. They also cut down on gas and spit ups because they are air tight. They are horrible because they leak!! Sometimes the lid would go on just right and I would have no problems and other times it would take me 10 tries before getting the lid on just right. I first thought I must be doing something wrong but after talking to several other mothers I found they were all having the same problem. This is very frustrating when you have a screaming crying baby who is waiting for her bottle! I am now expecting twins and will not be using Avent this time! I can not afford to waist 10 minutes trying to screw on a lid just right when I have two screaming babies waiting to be fed!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,It works fast & great but we didn't use it beyond 2 months. Wouldn't spend money on it unless you're storing breastmilk to use later.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"A recent study (Gaullier JM, Halse J, Hoye K, Kristiansen K, Fagertun H, Vik H, Gudmundsen O. Conjugated linoleic acid supplementation for 1 y reduces body fat mass in healthy overweight humans.

As far as I can tell (see the Medscape.com review on this study) there are no significant flaws that would invalidate the conclusions.In any case, a little booster to weight loss program is welcome and this alternative looks promising. Hopefully, the price of this supplement will follow the lead of the weight. :-)"

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"This is a fantastic product for anyone, young or old, to help remember medication times and to just keep the pills sorted so you don't have to open multiple bottles daily. I have 2 of them for my son and have found it such a tremendous relief to be able to sort medications for 2 weeks and just forget it! Great to toss in your purse when on the go and all the distractions of your running won't keep you from remembering med times. I wouldn't trade this product for anything and I've recommended it to friends and family :D"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I thought it was just me, until I read the other reviews. Everyone can't be assembling the bottle wrong.... So I would say they really need to figure out why and fix the problem fast...I got a pack of 4oz &amp; 9oz bottles for a baby shower gift. First, as a suggestion buying the 4oz bottles are a waste of money b.c they will be out of it in a couple of weeks so might as well by the 9oz if you are going to go with this bottle. Second, I have heard alot about the Dr. Brown's bottles so I will try those and see if they work out better as far as leaking..... Im not taking anything away from the Avent bottles b.c my son does very well on those, but the leaking or a big gush out is drawing me away from them. As far as price goes between the Avent and Dr. Browns they range the same, well atleast at babiesrus they do."

baby products,feeding,gift sets,4.0,I started off with the Avents. My son had the hardest time getting anything out of the 1st and 2nd stage nipples. It took 10 minutes to get 1 oz! And stage 3 was too fast. So I bought the VentAires. The only thing I noticed was that you have to stretch the nipple hole to open it up. And make sure all parts are dry before you put them back together....otherwise they'll leak. Aside from that.....I love um!

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"As one of the few who caught this on cable in the early 1980s, I can attest to the very disturbing nature of this film. 'Evilspeak' as a title doesn't have anything to do with the film itself, but that's fine. It is one of those rare horror gems that wrings every cent of value from its limited budget.Clint Howard is a downtrodden military school cadet who no one likes - he is beaten up by his fellow classmates, smacked around by his teachers, and beaten by the school chaplain (!). In despair, Clint conjures a long-dead devil through an Apple II computer. (Yep, it turns out the Steve Jobs is evil incarnate after all!) Who knew that Satan's minions could be called with an old Apple II with a dual-floppy drive? Wouldn't it be easier to just call collect?An explosive and gory revenge-fest follows....with explosions, swords, and wild pigs. Pigs were great in 'Hannibal', but this movie did it first.Clint Howard's only problem is the inevitable comparisons to Ron Howard. But Clint is a fine genre actor and he brings some fine moments to this 'B' flick. But be warned, this movie is disturbing and extremely violent.Recommended."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"After having 3 kids now ages 9,5 and 2 who all used the Playtex disposable nursers by my 4th I got tired of always running out of the drop ins and realized what an unecessary expense it had become. I also thought my 3 month old daughter was too tiny to be using one of those tall 8 oz bottles, (which is almost as big as her) as opposed to the nice compact design of the Avent nurser. I figured my sister-in-laws all use them and I'd never heard any complaints so I didn't even bother looking at the reviews before purchasing my own. Well I wish I had because now they tell me about the leaks. I'm right there with the other reviewer who said it was &quot;not a leak but a pour&quot; I always double and triple check the nipple and ring before giving my baby the bottle and about 50% of the time either right away or halfway through a bottle it will just start to pour out all over the baby and me. As a mom of 4 it can't be chalked up to inexperience I definitely know what I'm doing. So to those moms who haven't had any problems yet good luck to you, but I just wanted to warn others it might not but it can happen. Just imagine what it's like when you have to take the bottle away from your screaming hungry baby so you can clean up the mess and fiddle with the cap in he middle of a feeding (believe me it is not pleasant!)"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"This breast pump has been nothing but fast and easy for me (once I figured out how to put it together). I don't know if it's just because my son is such a tank and I produce a lot of milk, but I usually get four ounces in about five minutes. Aside from feeling a bit like a dairy cow, which would happen with any pump, it's very comfortable and easy to use. You can control the suction and lighten up immediately if it's too much. The kit is convenient for work and travel, and I love that what's inside the case isn't obvious."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"this pump only worked for one month, i only used it about ten days of the whole month it worked. it lost power. it took forever for me to get one ounce. it was better for me to use my own hands and i got more milk out for sure. do not waste your money on this pump, it comes out to be more expensive than the others since you have to go out to get another pump."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Of all of the protein bars I've ever had--and I've tried many--the protein bars by Designer Whey (Detour Caramel Peanut & Joyride Coconut Almond) are the best. By providing plenty of texture with either the coconut bits or the peanuts and putting plenty of flavor around their whey base it honestly tastes like you're eating a candy bar. I know that I'm sounding like I'm working for the company, but I'm just wanting to pass along the experience that I've had. I've wasted tons of money and time eating crummy protein bars. I'm really happy that my wife and I found these. The coconut almond are my favorite and the caramel peanut are my wife's.If these don't work for you as a second option I would recommend the bars by ProteinOne. Thirdly the bars by Myoplex.Hope this helps."

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I bought this for my son 2 years ago when he &quot;moved out&quot; of his high chair to a booster at the table. I was looking for a trough to catch the food falling out of his mouth or off the spoon, but couldn't find a bib that would work.We have used this for every meal since then, and take it traveling too. It keeps the plates from slipping, gives plenty of room for additional finger food alongside and catches drips.Ours now sports a small tear where my son tried to yank the suction cup off the table, and it now (after 2 years of everyday cleaning) has a sort of sticky feel that doesn't clean off anymore.I plan on using this one for at least another year, and will buy another one for future kids.We LOVE it, and have had many questions about where to buy one.p.s. It also &quot;stains&quot; temporarily with tomato sauce (or newspaper print - don't ask), but it fades on it's own within a day."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"My mom got me this pump so I could still breastfeed when I went back to work and I am so thankful that she did. Before this pump I had the Avent manual pump (which cost about the same as this one by the way) and although it did work, this one works so much better and so much faster. I am able to pump 8oz. in less than 20 mins. It is a great pump because I am able to continue breastfeeding her even though I am back at work, and it doesnt take much time. It is easy, and comfortable, and I recomend it to every working mom."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"When I was pregnant, my husband and I were sure I was going to breastfeed. So much so, that I didn't check out any bottles, etc. Then, I had my daughter and she had such trouble with latching on that I decided to pump my breastmilk and feed her with a bottle.I was given a boatload of bottles by people in my church and family members. They were horrible! The nipples had holes that were too big, and I wasn't so much feeding my little girl as I was trying to drown her, it seemed. We told our pediatrician about the trouble we were having, and he recommended this bottle. We tried it, and we are thrilled! She eats and then burps a couple of times and that's it. No major gas, spitting up, etc. I am absolutely satisfied."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"After spending money on 2 other pumps...I ended up buying this one, and it is worth every penny! I returned to work 3 months after having my baby, and started out pumping with a manual type. Then, I bought a single sided electric type, but it was very slow. This pump is like lightning!! I can pump 8-10 oz in just 3 or 4 minutes! The cleanup is quick and easy, and the 4 jars it comes with makes it easy to have ready to use the next time. I do not store milk in them, I pour it into disposable baggies, so I do not know if the leaking problem is true or not. The 4 breast shields are terrific...I use both sizes, so it's like having 4 instead of just 2. I use the ""large"" ones in the morning when I'm the fullest, and the ""small"" ones thru-out the day at work. There really isnt' that much difference in their size. Overall.....I give this pump a 10-star rating!!!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I use these in combination with regular Avent bottles. I have the converter to use with the Medela Advanced Pump, but I actually end up using the Avent hand-pump almost exclusively (faster for me, and quieter).I love the pre-sterilized and disposable quality. When I am behind on washing bottles or traveling, it's wonderful to know I have these on the shelf. I also use these for storing frozen milk. I had bad luck with freezing the bags and am much more comfortable with using these. Thawing frozen breast milk may take a little more time (although you can do it in the bottle warmer if you are careful) than a bag, but I'm willing to trade that for the pure convenience these offer.I do wish they sold the lids separately. And I wish I knew what to do with the dozen or so extra converter rings (2 with every pack adds up after a few packages). Also wondering why they pack a #1 nipple or two in most kits. My child uses a #3 nipple, so they end up going in the trash.Maybe it's just the pen I use, but I've found that I can wipe off the ink from use #1 while I was the container before use #2. I use a sharpie and write on the smooth part of the bottle that looks like it is designed for writing on. In soapy water, the ink wipes off. If I write on the textured part of the container, it stays. So I write my son's name on the textured part (in case they end up at daycare) and put a dot there for each subsequent use.These might be too expensive to use exclusively, but they are definately worth keeping a few packages in the cupboard."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"This is a nice pump if you are staying at home and plan to use it between normal feedings to relieve full breasts. However...if you plan to pump after you return to work you absolutely have to get a double electric pump. I used this pump when my milk first came in and after pumping for 20 minutes (switching hands because my wrists were getting sore...and then having my husband pump for a while) I had only expressed maybe a 1/2 ounce of milk and my breasts were still overflowing. I will say, though, it wasn't painful to use for my breast, only for my wrists. Not good for anyone who works at computers who may already have carpul tunnel from repetetive motions."

They both worked, but I liked the beer neutralizer better becuase it prevented the hangover and it also has a carb blocker in it so I can drink regular beer instead of lite beers."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,This is a great pump for an inexpensive price. It works just as well as the hospital pumps if not better.

It also comes with an AC adapter and a bag which is nice.

I am also into healthy food so the Luna Bars are a good compromise. Don't let the fact you're a guy stop you- these are marketed towards women (because of the soy craze), there's nothing here that can harm you.The Dulce flavor is among my favorite flavor (along with Nutz/Pecan and Dreams), having a sort of caramel/""rice crispy treat"" taste. Only problem is that I like this flavor so much I tend to eat too many, and they have alot of calories. So don't eat too many unless you are a very active person.The Clif line are a great help to those of us with health issues, and I commend them for their wonderful products."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,3.0,"I know this is going to seem freaky and geeky because Depends Protective Underwear is susposed to be used for adults who have poop and pee accidents but I actually use them when I have my menstral cycle. one of the companies that makes menstral pads and tampons used to make a protective underpanty for girls who get very heavy mentral cycles and they were smaller and a lot less bulky and alot more fitted then Depends but unfortunately because of the vanity of alot of women they didn't sell because most women were too embarassed to use them so they stopped making them and I get a very heavy menstral cycle so someone recommended I try Depends and when I get my cycle I have to wear these Depends undergarments along with menstral pads so I don't wake up in the morning and find that I have totally stained my under panties, pajamas and sheets which is very embarrassing and it also keeps me from getting yelled at for staining my sheets and pajamas. I will continue to keep using these at night during my cycle but I wish someone would make ones that are actually for menstral cycles again. Oh, the curse of having a extremely heavy menstral cycle!!!!! It's a major bummer! Okay, it's embarrassing to have to wear protective under panties at night when I have my menstral cycle but it's way, way way more embarrassing to stain my sheets, PJ's and cotton under panties so that is why I use these Depends! I now will only use the Pull up Ones though and will not use the ones with the tabs."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"We bought these bottles for our newborn....what a nightmare! The first time we tried to feed her with them, she tried to eat for 10 minutes and was getting very frustrated, so I check the nipple and nothing was coming out! After cracking the hole on the nipple open, we tried again. After a while, the bottle created such a vacuum, that the nipple started to colapse, so I constantly had to unscrew the bottom, since that side was up, to allow more are to get inside. After all of that, I tried rolling the bottom 'vent' portions to hopfully crack those seals open a little...it helped a little, but she still was getting so frustrated and exhausted! I tried the stage 2 nipples and the flow was so fast that she kept choking. After all of that, I returned them and bought the Playtex Premium disposable Nursers and the Avent disposables. The avent nipples were too long...but she LOVES the Playtex Premium Nursers!"

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I came home from the hospital with this pump, and absolutely love it. I didn't want to buy an electric pump right away because I wanted to make sure I would have a good supply and would be comfortable nursing. When we started giving our son breastmilk in the bottle, the Harmony made it easy for me to pump without getting too sore. The fact that it mimics a baby's sucking is a big plus. The only drawback to this, and my Medela Pump in style Traveler, is that my son will not take anything other than a Playtex natural latch nipple, and I can pump 8 oz from each breast at each session. To make it easier for us, I bought several sets of Playtex's One Step Breastmilk storage and feeding kits. The adaptor screws right on to the pump, and I can pump right into an 8 oz liner, which can then go straight to the freezer. When my husband needs a bottle, he just drops it into warm water and when it's thawed, puts it into a bottle. It has made life so much easier. I would highly recommend this pump, and the Medela pump in style."

I do have to say, you get what you pay for. I love this pump. I have an 8 week old son, and I am able to pump 6-7 ounces in 8 minutes. Since I am back to work full time now, the less time it takes me to pump, the better. I do pump 2 times a day, Monday thru Friday, and my supply has not decreased. The let down feature is great, and the storage and discreetness of the bag are wonderful. No one at work really knows what I am carrying.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"Like some of the other reviewers, this is the first storage kit used in storing my wife's breastmilk. The ring adapters work well with the Medela pump, but you'll need at least two of these kits if your pump is of the double action variety.Pros -1) Adapters work with Medela collection pumps of both the manual and powered variety.2) No need to transfer breast milk from storage to bottle, which can reduce some of the nourishment found in breast milk. The drop-in liners function for both storage AND feeding.3) 10 drop-in liners included here. These liners are not as fragile as those made by Gerber. They withstand heating and freezing rather well.Cons -1) You go through liners like crazy, but that is to be expected.2) If you plan to store breast milk ahead of time, you'll need plenty of these kits. Say you or your wife has to go into surgery (as mine did to correct some complications induced during the delivery of our daughter). My wife takes five of these collectors to work, each of which effectively holds 4 ounces. I've also got some breast milk in the freezer, others waiting to be cleaned. All told, we've purchased 5 of these kits. These costs add up.3) If you do as they say and just screw the kit into the bottle for feeding, the Playtex drop-in holders cannot give you an effective reading on how many ounces are left. For one, the liners collapse (to be expected), which does help in reduce the amount of air your baby gets. Second, the extra ring which fits around the latex drop-in raises the drop-in above the ""1 ounce"" mark. To get a proper reading on how much milk is left, you have to remove the latex drop-in from the screw-in ring and place it directly into the drop-in holder.Ok, so it sounds like its a pain. But it works, which is more than I can say for some of the other systems. Overall, Playtex's system works great for this stay-at-home Dad."

I switched to these yesterday out of desperation and can't imagine why I waited 7 weeks to try! These are perfect for nibblers and gourmet eaters who eat slow. It has almost completely eliminated the gas and spit-up problems were were having with the #1 & #2 nipples by avent. The 6oz. size is much more convient than the 4oz size that others come in. My son only used 4 oz sized bottles for 3 weeks! The only problens I see is they aren't supposed to be sterilized in a steam sterilizer or used in an electric bottle warmer. I run mine in the dishwasher and heat the formula in my 9oz avent bottles using my bottle warmer and pour it into the playtex ones. They also only have 2-4-6 oz markings on the bottle so it's a little harder to see how much has been eaten. Great bottles at a breat price (and the nipples are cheap to replace!)"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,Since we had twins we were going Through A LOT of dirty bottles. I didnt want to put the bottles in the dishwasher with all the other dishes. I didnt want to always have to boil the bottles on the stove either. So we purchased the Steam Sterilizer and im so happy we did. It has a permanent place on my counter top. I cant even count how many times i have used this in the past 6 months. And it still works at good as the first time. We have all avent bottles so i dont have a problem with bottles not fitting. Other reviews said the bottles were very wet when they came out...but if you think about it..they would be after all the sterilizing. After mine are done i just put them on the bottle dry rack and let them dry. Its just like when you wash them in the sink but this way you know they are getting clean ALL OVER. I think also that the dishwashers water gets hotter than this and does something to the nipples to the bottles. Ive had some friends who ran into shrinking nipples after putting them in the diswasher. I would rather be spending time with my children than standing over the stove boiling my bottles and part. It only takes 8 mins. Im very happy with our purchase

If you're a first-time mom who plans to breastfeed exclusively, but wants to have a little milk in the freezer just in case (as I did), that sounds perfect. Until you understand the mechanics of breastfeeding and pumping . . .If you want to give your baby a bottle of expressed breastmilk once in a while, you should buy a double pump. Here's why:1. The first time you pump, you will only get 1-2 ounces, or less, of milk. You need to pump every day, at the same time, for your body to know that it has to produce more milk. After 1-2 weeks, you will start to pump enough milk at one sitting for a bottle. Until then, you can freeze the little bit you get each day and combine it when you have enough.2. No pump will match the effectiveness of your baby. You can pump yourself ""dry"" and then latch your baby on. You baby will get milk! So, if you buy a single pump, like this one, you will need to nurse on one side while pumping on the other, in order for you milk to letdown. This is VERY tricky at first, but if you use a Boppy and a footstool, you can get the hang of it eventually. You will need to switch sides 2 times during the pumping session.3. This pump isn't as powerful as the more expensive, double pumps. It took me 15-30 minutes to pump 4-5 ounces, even after several weeks.I learned the hard way that a $100 single pump isn't worth very much, unless you just want to relieve engorgement or you don't mind going through the acrobatics described above. I REALLY wish I had saved my money and bought a double pump. It would have been worth it. This pump just sits in my closet now, because it was too time consuming.If you think you want to pump, buy the more expensive double pump. You won't be sorry!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,I think Aquaban is great because it is caffeine free. Other water pills I have taken to get relief from water weight bloating have caused me anxiousness and inability to sleep properly but Aquaban helps me shed the water safely and its natural. Several years ago I was hospitalized and on an IV for nearly a week. I gained nearly 20 pounds of fluid weight gain and Aquaban taken after I left the hospital helped me shed nearly all of the retained fluid in a week.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"Worked once. Expressed 2oz from each breast @ a rate of 30mins per breast. Next day...what? Could this still be the same unit I used yesterday? The suction was totally non-existent. The neck of the plastic that fits into the hand held motor unit would not stay in place properly. O-ring must have ruptured or something. Would not create a vacuum unless I pressed plastic neck into motor unit with all my might. You're supposed to be relaxed when pumping milk! Yea, right. I hope I can still get my money back..."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"We used these bottles with my little sister 6 years ago, & I started my son on them (with breastmilk) from birth. It's very easy for them to go from breast to bottle, I loved the pop-in cap for storage, and ALL Avent pieces are interchangeable!! I had to switch to Dr. Brown's recently because my baby has severe gas problems, but I would have stayed with Avent except for that. They're so easy to clean because of the wideness.P.S. As for everyone complaining they leak, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I read a recent review saying she didn't know why they left room between the threads that screw on the cap & nipple, the bottle info explicitly says this is to let air vent out, that is why they leak when you screw the cap on too tight. It just takes a light twist & it's on. If you've got a really gassy baby, go with Dr. Brown, otherwise, these are awesome for the breastfed baby!"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,These bottles used to leak for me but I figured out the problem. I was tightening the rings too tight. Just tighten them enough so their not too loose and not too tight. This should fix the problem. It did for me. I would give them five stars now that they don't leak any more.

When it says ""Moist Heat"", it really means it. She can set it for a 30 minute session, and it really delivers moist heat, just like the moist heat packs in a Physical Therapy or Chiropractor's clinic. The moist heat really sooths her back pain, and now we have two! I had to get my own."

baby products,feeding,gift sets,5.0,"These bottles are a lifesaver!!! My daughter started out on the avent system (which is GREAT if you're breastfeeding/pumping), but she ALWAYS threw up after every single bottle... but her doctors said she had no signs of acid reflux. Being a new mom it took me awhile to realize that it just might be the bottles causing her so many problems, so I switched to the ventaires... and ALL the throwing up disappeared virtually overnight!!! These bottles are so easy for her to hold and feed herself (she's 9 months now), and they are super easy to clean. The Dr. Browns bottles also worked really well, but are a royal pain to keep clean, which is why we love these ones so much... no straw for anything to get gooped up in!!! I would suggest these bottles to ANY new mom to use from day one... they are just so great!!!"

baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"My son has acid reflux and feeding was hard enough as it was, let alone having to have my husband hold the Boppy so that it wouldn't slip away from my body. The velcro (though loud to take off if the baby falls asleep) on the Brest Friend and the back support are a FABULOUS pairing.I've loaned this to 2 other friends who also tossed out their Boppies for the Brest Friend, and I won't even bother with the Boppy when my second arrives this spring."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"My wife certainly appreciates this pump and is very happy with how it works.We did have a problem with our pump out of the box, however. Medela was very helpful in getting us a replacement but when it came time to collect the defective product, they left out the service in customer service. Please be aware that the Medela representative said that they do not ever pay for return shipping on a returned item. Therefore, my $350 pump (after tax) cost another $10-15 + time at the post office to get it working.So, if you get a good pump from the store, I'm sure you'll love it. Otherwise, be prepared to waste additional time and money to get a working pump."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"""What better way to suggest friendliness-and to create it- than with a cup of tea?""-- J. Grayson LuttrellThis is bit of a departure from my usual reviews but I'm certainly fond of tea, and there's nothing like the right cup of tea to accompany an evening read, good music, or a compelling movie. I won't claim any sophisticated knowledge of tea and tea drinking -just that I know what I like, much as I do anything else! ^_^Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of many exotic teas produced by Harney & Sons. It comes in silken sachets (elegant pyramid shaped bags that show off the blend within and allow the tea to breathe) and I'm not surprised it is one of the company's most popular blends. Those sachets are definitely eye-catching. Even the occasional tea-drinker will notice an aesthetic difference in the presentation. Despite the posh packaging, this is a tea that kicks its shoes off and pulls on the fuzzy slippers and settles into a comfy chair by the fire.Hot Cinnamon Sunset is black tea, several cinnamons, orange and cloves. A medium bodied tea that can be served with sugar or honey and milk if desired. You don't need a great deal of sugar with this one, even if you have a sweet tooth like mine. The cinnamon sweetness is pretty powerful. This is the kind of tea that is perfect for casual company-especially during the holidays. For friends and family who might normally prefer something like Lipton teas, this will be a delightful change, but won't be too subtle or intimidating either. For those who prefer Oolongs, and teas that just hint at aroma and flavor, this won't, pardon the expression, be your cup of tea. This is also the type of tea best served -dare I say it-in a big mug. Cinnamon sunset is just that kind of comfort tea. Great for a rainy day snuggled up under the blankets.This tea is the perfect accompaniment for me when I'm rereading a book I love. An old favorite from my childhood, such as CHARLOTTE'S WEB by E.B. White or one of my Terry Pratchett novels, such as A HAT FULL OF SKY. Music-wise, I'd recommend the sweet and mellow sounds of Mary Youngblood on the Native American flute. Or, if you're into the holiday season, then a robust selection of carols or holiday favorites.Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"We just opened our shiatsu massage Christmas day and it broke in 10 minutes. I was very unsatisfied with the performance. It did not do what it was supposed to. Every time the motor reached the bottom or the top it shut off. It would not turn on after it shut off the first time. It quit working after 10 minutes and it would not run properly when it did resume power. The unfortunate thing is they only allow 15 minute use at a time, and yes it does fall short of the high and low points of the spine. The other issue is it would improve if you could stop the motors at specific points on your back where you need it the most. I am leary on getting another one after this."

With the feature of being able to pull them up, it makes putting them on much easier.

I really like them because they are now much easier to use by yourself. Wearing them to prevent an accident of some sort is definately better than waking up to a mess.....which would be REALLY embarassing to ANYBODY! Overall though, I rate this item FIVE STARS!!!

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"We used these bottles for our first child. They weren't my choice, but my mother in law bought them and we were stuck. Should have switched. So much work was involved in cleaning them. Then the plastic discs would get clogged and we had to soak them in bleach every so often which made me worried. It was such a bummer when I would pour formula into the bottle thinking everything was put together correctly, only to have the formula (liquid gold to us) leak out all over the counter. After all of that, our son still spit up. UGH! We are expecting our second child soon and I refuse to go through that hassle again. I am going to try something else even though we have so many of the other bottles from last time."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"My doctor prescribed medication that would not allow me to nurse while taking them, so I needed to express to keep my milk supply up. I was hesitant to purchase this pump based on other reviews, but I was despearate and had little choice at the time I could not afford the Medela. It is THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, and because it is a &amp;quot;personal hygiene item&amp;quot;, I cannot return it. It is LOUD (to me it always sounded like the motor was about to die), the milk gets backed up in the chambers, so you have to stop and break the suction to allow it to drain, the milk also gets sucked under the breast shields. It takes a really long time to express and my breasts were never emptied, they were always just as engorged and painful as before I started pumping. I didn't really mind washing and keeping track of all the little parts (alot more than the medela). I was able to get a Medela, I packed the Evenflo away and have never looked back. Perhaps it would be okay for light/ocassional pumping. But in my opinion it's a piece of junk!!!!!!"

He is 8 months now and I don't care for this seat. It is just so upright in the back and since it's all clothy, it has no real support and I don't like that. He always looks so uncomfy. Plus we brought it to go to restaurants but you can't use it (not supposed to) on tables that only have 1 leg or many tables are too thick to attach this too. Just was a waste of money for us. My SIL uses hers still and her daughter is now 19 months old. So to each their own but for us, he likes his booster chair MUCH better and so do we."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"My son wound up in the hospital at 6 weeks with severe high volume reflux. The gastroenterologist recommended Dr Browns bottles with an X cut nipple ( we needed to add cereal to his formula to weigh it down so it would stay in his stomach ). Prior to switching bottles he would gulp so much air there was little room in his stomach for food and it would come right up, he would also squirm in pain from the air bubbles in his belly. When we switched to Dr Browns I saw immediate results (even before the we started his reflux meds), there is still some spit up but the gas pains are GONE. I wouldn't even try to switch to another brand. As far as cleaning, the very little extra time it may take is so worth the comfort my son has received from using these bottles. But really it takes very little extra time. I put all the pieces in a basket on the top shelf of the dishwasher(I don't even need the little brush they include...) and they go through the dry cycle to sterilze just fine. And the leaking some people have experienced I believe is from overtightening the cuff which is easy to do and will produce immediate leaking but is easy to fix. Don't forget to keep the vent clear for best results. One last note, I prefer the wide mouth bottle, it's great for mixing powder formula or adding cereal..."

They're cheaper and easier to use."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking.So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Of everything I registered for, this was the single most critical/useful item of them all. I was SO ENGORGED when they released me from the hospital after my son was born that all I could do was cry and leak milk. Thankfully, my Medela breast pump was waiting for me when I got home. I had tried a hand pump, which was useless and very discouraging. However, I had my Pump In Style up and running in no time, and I felt better immediately!! Not only did my breasts return to a normal size and texture, but my son was finally able to latch on and nurse, and boy was he HUNGRY! In the months that followed, I was able to return to work and continue to pump 2-3 times a day -- my son NEVER needed formula EVER. My best advice to you is -- buy this item BEFORE you give birth. People who tell you you won't need it until you return to work have obviously never dealt with engorgement issues. I have also heard of people successfully using a breast pump to help their milk ""come in"" if it is taking a long time and your baby is really fussy/hungry. Plus, pumping and storing allows dad to be able to feed the baby too, which is great for bonding for them and great for you when you just need to SLEEP (or read, or shop, or take a HOT BATH!). I am a HUGE FAN of this product, which was never painful, was easy to use and clean, extrememly reliable and transportabe and allowed me to be able to provide my baby with the very best food even when I was not around to nurse him.

The heat function is basically useless, and it is more of a vibrator than a masseuse, but it's been great for my back. I bought it for my company car, a Pontiac Aztek, because the seatback offers negative lumbar support. This cushion strapped right on and got the job done.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"For the &lt;$100 this is a great massager. Its massages very well mainly because of the rollers that travel the lenght of the spine on the back. Its as effective as any hand massage session if not better. The rollers are quite strong so a towel or a thick shirt would be good before running the massager. When it starts to hurt it can simply be switched off.The couple of things which i would have desired in this is to have the rollers work on the thighs also. There is no rollers on the seatable portion of this so its like just dumb seat!! the other problem is that the rollers really doesnt reach the lumbar bone of my back which i find it sometimes frustrating since that is the portion of my back which needs extra care.I mainly use the lower back setting since i sit in front of a computer most of the time and can feel the difference after a 10+minute. Though the back muscles are loosened i would have desired it to be a little lower on the lumbar bone area. other than this i am very happy with the performance of this product..some questionsI did wonder if this has heat?NO..mainly rollers which applies pressure..is it plugged in or battery operated?No battery. Just an AC adapter.Can you take it in the car? {in other words, is it portable, or do you need to be near an outlet?}There is no car adapter provided by homedics. but i have seen lot of listings for the same on eBay.How about the material, and the level of settings?The material feels like leather. its really good. but as i said above better to wear a thick shirt and then use it as the rollers are pretty good.3 SettingsLower Back, Upper Back and Full back."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"Our son has reflux and had colic, and these bottles were recommended to us by several people. We started using them when he was 4 weeks old. At first, we thought they were helping but then began to notice that after feedings he would get the hiccups EVERY time. This didn't happen with our other bottles (Avent and Playtex nursers, and Evenflo bottles). He seemed miserable with hiccups.Secondly, after we started to use these, he began to refuse his pacifier. The Dr. Brown's nipples are so soft, that he fell in love with them and just wanted to suck on the nipple instead of his pacifier.Perhaps our son didn't do well with them because of his reflux, but now he is on the Evenflo Comfi nursers and doing fabulous. I do think that Dr. Brown's should make pacifiers that are similar to their nipples, because they are made of such thin, soft silicone, that our son could instantly tell the difference between them and preferred them over his pacifier, even when he was not hungry. Now, we are trying to break him of the habit of needing a bottle to fall asleep!"

Also this is very small and lightweight and it really does read the temp in 1 second. You need to follow the directions because when I first tried it, it said 101 and then I looked at the directions again and tried again and got a normal reading, you need to press the button, insert in the ear, then release the button while its in the ear, its done in an instant. my 4 year old thinks its very neat and asked for her temp to be taken as soon as she saw it, but I really bought it for the baby on the way, and I tried it on myself, its really great for the whole family especially babies as my old thermometer seemed to take forever to get done and when your kid is sick and squirmy you end up having to start over sometimes. I don't know how the performance compares to other ear scanning devices, I never bought one before because they all seemed to have bad reviews, they sounded difficult to operate correctly and required probe covers. But I would definately reccomend trying it out when your child isn't sick to make sure its accurate and you get the hang of it before you really need it."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,3.0,"I tried this product because I was looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter. My main reason for choosing the low carb version over the regular version was that the former was also lower in fat. Although I found the taste of this product to be pleasant, it tastes nothing like peanut butter and is somewhat of an acquired taste. In addition, the lack of sugar results in a texture similar to natural peanut butter--ie, the oils separate, which necessitates stirring the product. I sometimes found that by the time I reached the bottom of the jar, the remaining product was dry and crumbly. Although this product is adequate if you are counting carbs, I prefer IM Healthy's regular Soy Nut Butter."

This will give you additional freezer storage capabilities, but only 4 liners at a time. (the reason for only 4 stars).

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We have preemie twins (born 2 months early at 2 & 3 lbs). One girl has severe gas problems & the other constantly spit-up. We bought the 8-ounce version of these bottles after reading hundreds of reviews, etc. I'd swear by them! A marked improvement in reducing gas, vomitting, spit-up, & colic! We went to stage 2 nipples when our girls were 3 months old and both do fine. Extra parts are no problem. They're easy to clean and well worth the saved time & energy in cleaning vomit off furniture, floors, clothing, & babies. As for leaks, no problem. For transporting use the disks (included) under the nipples before screwing on the caps just like you would with any other bottle. When warming in a bottle-warmer or pan the heated air has nowhere to go so it comes out the air-tube designed to keep air out of baby (overflow/leaks). Just loosen the caps before warming...problem solved. We tried several other bottles and none worked as well as these. I highly recommend Dr. Brown's and wouldn't use anything else!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I almost didn't buy these due to the comments regarding the leaking problems. However, I took a chance and am so happy I did. Bottles are wonderful!!! My baby is breast-fed and I also supplement with formula. I chose the wide neck and she is very happy taking the nipples. Before Dr. Brown bottles - she would cry every day with pains in her belly from gas and had a problem with spitting up. I am happy to report that neither are a problem since we have purchased them. I have not had any problems with leaking - and - I do not think the extra parts are a big deal to wash or put together. Besides, they are worth it if it helps sooth your baby."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,4.0,"In the past I have quoffed more than my share of supplements. Tons of different pills with different claims from carb blocking to energy enhancing. After years of trying different things I came to the conclusion that very few of the over the counter ""nutrients"" I tried did what they claimed. Not only that but the more I read the more I realized I might be HURTING myself by taking megadoses of certain vitamins, or tiny doses of things like Kava.After careful consideration I decided that I would take ONE multivitamin a day and that was it. I asked the pharmacist to recommend a brand and he did. Unfortunately the brand he suggested and many others I found contain Iodine which breaks my skin out.One-A-Day makes vitamins that do not contain Iodine. After looking through the One-A-day selection I opted to go with the WeightSmart. The WeightSmart vitamin is a green unscored pill of about 1/2 inch long. I personally have no trouble swollowing it, but for those that do have difficulty it could easily be cut with a pill cutter.Let me make it clear that the WeightSmart vitamin DOES NOT make you lose weight. It contains ingredients that help support you as you lose weight. Ingredients that give you the nutritional support you may not get because you are eating less food. The WeightSmart also contains EGCG or green tea extract. Much has been claimed about the benefits of green tea. It contains ingredients that are said to be healthy. It is also claimed but UNPROVEN that green tea aids in weight loss. In addition in the studies done on weight loss the patients were given higher doses of EGCG each day than that which is in these vitamins.The company does not claim that WeightSmart will make you lose weight. This is a quote from their website"

I prefer the Orange Mango over the Berry Blast for flavor, but they both taste good, at least better than the after taste off Red*ull.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"It is a surprising good tea at great price. The best part is its after taste, leaving a very enjoyable clean, fresh and delicate sweetness at the back of your mouth. I could feel the breath improved too.I work in the office and always wanted to eat some candy or cookie in the afternoon. After start drinking this tea (about a month ago), I was surprise to find out that I didn't have the same desire to eat the candy or cookie any more! What a surprise nice finding! I think it is because of its satisfying aftertaste. Each tea bag, I would say, could make two good cups of tea easily.I also highly recommend following FooJoy Shoumei White Tea (B0007UXIW0), FooJoy China Green Tea (B0007V1Q78) in this line. If you like black tea, you might want to try Foojoy Dim Sum Bo Nay (B0007Y7Z8E). It is very interesting"
baby products,feeding,gift sets,4.0,"I breastfed my son for almost three months. At three weeks I introduced a bottle of expressed milk with a Medela bottle. He took to the bottle right away but got VERY gassy. I tried the Playtex drop-ins that we got as a shower gift and they didn't help. I bought a Ventaire bottle and that did the trick.I did have one bottle that leaked, but only the one. Early on the nipples would collapse but the Playtex people told me that if you stretch the rubber insert before you put the bottle together it would prevent that, and it seems to help.It is a pain to clean all of the parts, but I feel like I am getting the bottle cleaner because I am taking it apart than I would if it didn't come apart. I generally wash them by hand.I gave the bottle four stars vs. three with mothers who breastfeed in mind. My son has no problems with the stage 1 nipples - my guess is that this is because he started on the breast where he had to work for his milk. Even now that he is weaned I am in no hurry to switch him to the stage 2 nipple as I have read that breastfed babies generally have straighter teeth because of how they have to suck on the breast. I think these nipples replicate that and will hopefully have a similar beneficial effect."

Well the only cases we had were when they were sick, but we have never had diaper rash outside of an illness...THIS STUFF IS THE BEST! IT IS LESS MESSY THAN OTHER DIAPER CREAMS, AND HAS NO ODOR (great for those with allergies or sensitivity to scents). IT MAY SEEM EXPENSIVE BUT IT JUST TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT EACH TIME, SO IT LASTS FOREVER. It is the consistency of petrolium jelly.

My child no longer has such a fussy time sputtering, gagging, gassing on leaky Avent bottles.I disagree with the people saying they are hard to clean. Actually, they require effort to clean them! Putting bottles in heat above 140 degrees or a dishwasher releases the chemical in the plastic called Bisphenol A. So handwash your bottles anyway!That would be my criticism, I with these were made of the same material the Baby b Free bottles that HandiCraft has in Europe."

I was pumping every two hours the milk my son needed and now my son is four months and weighs 15 pounds on pure breast milk no formula or cereal. He doing great and not once has he gotten sick. No ear infections thus far. This product is easy to use, clean, and store away. Great Product!!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"My husband and I love this bottle warmer. We Put two bottles in it before bed with the ice pack and all we have to do is go to the baby's room and pour the water in the heating chamber, put the bottle in and press the button. We change her diaper while the bottle is warming and usually warms it just about perfect. Measuring the correct amount of water to put in the chamber is the key. There are instructions right on the side of the bottle storage area on how much water to put in the chamber depending on what you are warming up. I have really enjoyed and used a few of the First Years products and they all have been easy to use and make being a new mommy that much less stressful. If you use the Dr. Browns Bottles, make sure you remove the two parts of the bottle that go inside before you heat it up, the pressure of the heat builds up and will cause the bottle to leak and the hot plate will keep on warming as long as there is fluid on it to steam. Then you have a mess on your hands. (our daughter uses the Dr. Browns bottles because she sucks a lot of air sometimes when we are feeding and she has been quite colicky!) Also if you call First Years they will send you an additional bottle cooler and Ice pack so you can rotate them for free. This is a great company with wonderful products!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,I had been using the lansinoh milk storage bags and ran out so I tried these bags. I found them very hard to use. The Lansinoh bags have a zip top like the gerber bags yet I have not had a problem with them leaking. I was very dissappointed in these bags since you have to place them in a cup and they are awkward and don't lay flat when frozen. I have a supply of milk in my freezer and if I couldn't lay them flat I would have no room for my other freezer items. I was extremely happy with the lansinoh bags and would reccommend them instead of these.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"Listen all - as a Dad of 2 (19mo & 3mo) these bottles LEAK.It's not nipple age, microwaved, dish-washed, or how your kid sucks it down. It's a matter of how the nipple fits into the cap and how the cap and nipple screw onto the bottle.Trust me, as a dude I went through all of the above. Brand new out of the box or used over 6 months you just have to resign to the fact that these things have a tendency to spill out.DUDE's GUIDE TO LEAKING BOTTLE:A. After filling the bottle's content, cap it and shake or tip the bottle over the sink. Allow contents to spill out of nipple. Then tip the bottle upright. It is at that time you will know if your bottle is leaking or not. If it is leaking, proceed to Step B. If it is not leaking, repeat process a couple more times just to be sure. Feed baby.B. If the bottle does spill or leak, unscrew the cap and use a paper towel or bib and dry the inside threads of the white cap.Dry the external threads of the bottle as well. Screw on cap. Reef on it like you mean it (usually you're PO'd by now so a little agression helps). Repeat Step A.Avent bottles are based of a simple principle of channelling air through the nipple/cap threads rather than having the baby backwash (ala chugging a Dr. Pepper from a bottle). It needs to draw air. While eating, just make sure the nipple is at least 1/2 way in the baby's mouth and his lips/mouth are WIDE open as if he was nursing.These moms that say they have to tip their baby upside down etc. is baloney. Tip the bottle - DUH! And as for air/gas/burping, all babies suck air while nursing/bottle-fed. Babies do that. They still have the breathe-thru-nose-while-eating mechanism after doing the same for months in the womb.So trust me. It takes a little work to understand these things. These ARE good bottles and they DO work. Just be aware of the above.Hope this helps."

Light one up and your house will smell divine. It has just the right amount of scent and the red currant fragrance is loved by all. It smells delicious, expensive, intriguing...I give them as gifts and I splurge and keep several on hand so I never run out.

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I have triplets and have no time to spare.The Avent bottles perform beautifully. These bottles are easy for my seven month olds to hold; quite a feat for the bottles and the babies considering that they were born two months early. The bottle shape is broader and shorter than most other brands. This puts most of the liquid near the face so baby does not have to work so hard holding it up.The wide shaped nipple is outstanding!! Our son would inhale most other brands so I decided to try Advent solely for the nipples shape. They took to Advent right away.These features make it snap to clean and sanitize. I have only one bottle for each baby.Here is my routine:Mix large amount and pour or mix in each bottle (blending with small hand held blender either way).Feed them.Rinse out the bottles; wash in tub of warm soapy water that is permanent fixture on the counter.Rinse and toss in microwave sanitize bag and nuke.Ta Da.Thanks for reading and hope you find it useful,"

I'm sure it will be better when my daughter gets a little bigger, and hopefully with a some time, the tray will slide much easier. As far as the other features, the recline options are great, the seat position is versatile for different heights, and the wheels roll well on carpet and vinyl. I love how well padded it is too. It seems very comfortable. Overall, a great buy."

All the lactation consultants on staff applauded my choice of breastfeeding pillow. The fact that it straps onto my body makes it very secure - I can actually walk with my baby still nursing (holding both the baby and the pillow for safety). I have the new model with the clip instead of velcro, so I haven't had the noise problems that others have had. I also find I'm pretty maneuverable in the pillow, so I don't have to take it off to lay my baby down in the cradle or bouncy seat after a feeding. I've machine washed and dried the removable cover with no shrinkage problems. Overall, this is one of the most useful items I have for my baby, and I recommend it with no reservations."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"I bought this because of a wisdom tooth that's coming in, and I wanted something to protect it, and lessen the pain, but without the numbing effects of Anbesol. Sadly, the product didn't work at all for me...It comes with a measuring cap, with markings on it so you know when to stop pouring, and you simply swish it around in your mouth for a minute. It doesn't taste bad, it really doesn't taste like anything at all, and it's a little thick. (non-toxic too, if you swallow it) No numbing, no stinging, nothing.It's supposed to put a barrier above whatever in your mouth is causing you harm, so it can heal itself, much like a liquid bandaid... which is a great idea, but again, it didn't seem to work at all for me, and I still got some sharp pains from my wisdom tooth.Maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't buy this again. Back to numbing Anbesol for me I suppose."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I will be returning to work part-time this week and wanted to continue exclusively breastfeeing my 9 week old son. After speaking with a lactation consultant and a friend of mine, who also has this pump, they both recommended the Medela Pump in Style -- the cadillac of breast pumps! When I bought the pump about 5 weeks ago, my husband and I were embarking on a long roadtrip with our newborn from Philadelphia to Atlanta to visit family for the Easter holiday. I bought the car adapter and pumped in the car in order to maximize our driving time and not have to stop as often to nurse. It was so easy and efficient. Unlike manual pumps, which can cause a lot of discomfort, the Pump in Style is very comfortable. It is discreet and easily portable, which comes in handy for any mom returning to work who wants to continue breastfeeing. When you compare the cost of formula, this small investment is worth every penny not to mention all the health benefits of nursing!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,I never use it. Sure you sterilize your bottles and nipples before there first use but you do not have to sterilize the bottles and nipples after every use. You can just was them in your dishwasher or hand wash with very hot water. Our sterilizer just sits in a corner collecting dust.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"One of the reasons I got this set is that I assumed that everything I would need would be in it. Only in fine print did it mention that nipples weren't included. I was hoping since it was a set that I wouldn't need to buy extra items for this pump...I did shell out over 300 dollars for it. So after pumping I realized that I had to go back to the store and get the Natural Latch nipples. A total hassle if you have a newborn w/ you. Cost of 2 nipples $2.99.Still the pros:1. does not pull on the nipples.2. easy to put together.3. the liners are pretty strong.4. motor is more quiet the the Medala one.5. good customer serviceAnd the Cons1. My lactation nurse said that this pump isn't as ""great"" because it is used for people who already got their milk supply and NOT for someone who is just beginning to nurse and would like to increase their milk supply. I am stuck at producing 1 ounce milk per pump apparently because of it. Her suggestion is to rent a ""hospital grade Medela pump"" to increase my milk supply.2. Does not offer replacement parts if you want to buy them at the store3. rubber (soft cub shield) becomes lose after a few use4. takes a long time to dry them5. Does not have battery pack6. Is not compatible with avent bottles, neither is the bottle adapter that the kit offers if you buy that. So I still have to do the transfers."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I don't write reviews although I have been very happy with most of my purchases as a first time mom. But I felt especially eager to write one about this booster seat since I have been through every one imaginable, opened up the boxes and knew from the get go that they wouldn't work and just kept returning every one. Until I bought this Fisher Price booster. It securely locks on to any type of chair, my son at 6 months old sits straight up in this one, unlike slumping to the sides in the others. He loves the big tray because all of his toys fit on it and I love that you can adjust the tray to three positions considering my son is a very healthy 21 pound big boy at such a young age. And to boot it folds up so quickly and has a strap for you to take it any where with you, not like the others that are in 2 or 3 pieces. I would HIGHLY recommend this booster to first time moms who do not have the time to go back and forth to stores returning 5 other ones (like I did). I'll save you the time so you can spend those precious moments with your son or daughter."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I'm really flabbergasted by the negative reviews of this pump. I used this with great success, but then tried an electric at the suggestion of a friend. I quickly switched back to the Isis because it was just better at expressing my milk. The fact of the matter is that any product is going to be a failure if you don't use it correctly, and pumping breastmilk is not exactly something every woman grows up knowing exactly how to do. I was a full-time student when I was nursing my son and I used the Isis daily. It was the most comfortable, most effective, and most economical choice I could have made. If you are working 40-hour weeks, this may not be the best pump for you just because it is manual. But if you only need to express once or twice a day, this is really just a phenomenal apparatus."

I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I recently bought this and had problems from the start. I was told it was a great pump but I beg to differ. It wouldn't pump well first off and I had to constantly readjust it on my breast. It is hard to do anything else because you have to concentrate on pumping. Many people will tell you it's a good pump but if you plan on getting a decent amount of milk out, it isn't in my opinion. It takes entirely too long as well. One session can easily last an hour, on one breast! And to top it all off, it broke last night on me! Go with an electric pump. You'll have to pay more, but since you can't return pumps, you'll be safe with the best instead of wasting money with manual pumps first, like I did."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Unless you have a round the clock personal masseuse, this stick is the best thing to have when you get a headache. I've had migraines since I was 3, and I can attest to knowing what it's like when the drugs just aren't working, but you have to keep going with your day. This little rollerball has helped me get through it more than once. The combination of peppermint and lavender oils really does soothe the headache and the tension and lets you at least function when you can't find a nice, soft pillow. I've used it on many, many friends and family members, too, when they were under the weather, and they all came back to me wanting to know where they could get their own miracle stick. It's so handy that I never leave home without it, not even to go snowboarding!"

At first I thought the information they were telling me was baloney, but when I tried it, Voila, it worked!I was tightening the bottles by hand around the collar, with out using the cap. This was causing the bottles to leak most of the time. The trick is to hold onto the cap to tighten the bottle! Believe me I really didn't think it would make any difference, however I have not had one leaky bottle since!I would recommend the Avent bottles with no hesitation, my daughter has had no trouble with spitting up at all."

At first I could not get let down with the purly yours and when it finally did, it takes twice as long. With the avent it takes about 10 - 15 min. and I'm done. The only draw back is if you have larger breasts the petal will not work. But, just leave it out and you're ready to go."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,I am a full time working mom and I pump every day. The storage system functions well but takes up too much space in the freezer. I have a chest freezer that is currently half full of nothing but stored breastmilk in the Lansinoh storage bags because they store flat. I wouldn't have nearly enough room for the playtex ones and for the cost I wouldn't be able to afford that many lids.It is a great idea though. I am hoping I will use the supplies more when I stay at home with baby #2 and I am not pumping every day.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I used both the Avent bottles and these Playtex. Based on my experience the Playtex bottles are the best. Of all the nipples on the market these ones are most like the breast so it's easier to do both. I didn't use these with my first child and she spit up after every single feeding, with this baby she hardly ever spits up. I believe it's because of the bottle, it seems to go down easier and because there is not air she's not spitting up. The avent bottles leak when you don't put them together right, you have to be careful not to overtighten. Also with the avent bottles, even the slowest nipple seems to come out too fast, she always seems like she's gulping it down. My only suggestion with these bottles, which again comes from experience, is to spend the extra money and buy the drop in liners. The bag liners always seemed to leak no matter how I assembled them and also it was harder to measure the formula into the liners. Because I was so afraid of them leaking I would pull the liner down further and therefore wouldn't get the full amount the bottle would take. I have had no problems with the drop in liners leaking or breaking, no matter how much abuse I put them through!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"After much review, my daughter decided to add this pump to her baby registry since she only planned on pumping occasionally.But, during the second use, the pump just stopped working right in the middle of pumping and would not restart. She also noticed that the pump was difficult to use since the suction kept breaking. It was also very loud. Luckily, Baby's R US exchanged this pump and let her upgraded to the Pump N Style and she loves it. Its much easier to use and it has a larger motor which is necessary even for the occasional pumper. It is, of coarse, a bigger investment but if you want a reliable breast pump consider making the investment."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"With my daughter (now 3) she would take almost ANY bottle, any nipple, and never have ANY gaseous problems. With my now 9 month old twin sons, they are VERY picky ""nursers"".The ventairs didnt leak, didnt spill, and were easy to clean... but the boys just HATED them. My husband went to buy more, since we were really running low on the 5 bottles we had that the boys would use (ventairs, they would use em', but they didnt like it!) And he had ""accidently"" came home with the Natural shaped nipples... My boys LOVED them. We didnt realize it was a different nipple until we examined the box to go pick up more, the nipple did the trick!As for the bottle itself, I have always loved them. Its easy to pour milk into (some bottles have too small of an opening) and they are easy to ""set up"". You just grab a bottle (the clear plastic ""body"") Find a base and screw it on TIGHTLY (the thing that looks like its part of a gas mask) and than attatch a nipple. The bases and nipple rings come in different colors, but I have never found them to ""not work"" on all ventairs... What I mean is the natural nipple rings can fit on the bottles that came with the regular nipples and so on... and it doesnt matter if the base and nipple rings are the same color or from the same set (everyone probablly knows this, but just adding in my 2 cents). I found ours to NEVER leak if we had it on right... On those occasional nightly feedings (you know, when your half awake?) that we would set it up wrong and it would leak, our fault entirely... NOT the bottles. I also LOVE that there are different shaped nipples, and they all work with ALL of the ventair bottles, so you can purchase new ones if yours ""wear out"" (although they seem to be much tougher than the avents that my daughter used) and you can purchase a whole different set of nipples if your child doesnt like the ones you have, its really a trial and error thing. I also love how easy it is to clean them. It sounds like it would be a pain to have to clean a base, a body, a nipple, and a ring of 2x the bottles right? WRONG. This makes it super easy and convinient to clean... With other bottles we would have to dig and scrub the bottom, and sometimes we would just toss a bottle because the bottom was too disgusting. With the Ventairs you dont have this problem. We have a double sink, and keep warm, soapy water on one side, and just rinse off a bottle and throw it in. Than at the end of the day we take them all out and rinse them off, (and make sure theres nothing left inside of them) and place them in the sterelizer or the dishwasher... EASY... I swear this would be IMPOSSIBLE without the 4 parts to the ventair, if you did that with a regular bottle, you would end up with GROSS bottles, you would definatly have to scrub EACH BOTTLE for about 4 minutes to get everything out... Whats even ""cooler"" is that it actually helps with preventing gas and spit-ups... My sons are coliky, and they have ALWAYS haved gas and spit up problems, we never thought this would be a problem that we could solve, but along came the Ventairs and POOF, hardly EVER do we have gas problems? Now that the boys are eating solids, these bottles have still proven to be worth their weight in gold! They are easy for a baby to hold, and they dont have the tilt thier head back all the way since teh ventairs shape takes care of that! My nice is 16 months old now and even HER ventairs can handle drops, tantrums, rattling in the diaper bag all day, and various kinds of drinks and they NEVER leak, and NEVER break... Its like ""super bottle"".I cant imagine how many minutes we save each day with the ventairs, even if you have a bottle that ""works"", and your baby does fine with it, purchase a few ventairs, they will save you precious time... hey, they are only this size for so long right?"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This is a very easy and useful product. I'm very glad to have this now with this baby because last time I melted the parts to my breat pump by keeping them on the stove boiling and forgot about them. With this sterilizer, you just put your stuff in, place in microwave for 5 minutes and if you forget about it, at least the microwave will stop on its own. And it recommends that you leave in microwave for 2 minutes after it stops anyways. You can manage to put in more than you would think, bottles, (I'm using 6 oz. size), pacificers, breast pump parts, etc. And if you need to do more, than how difficult is it to reload and microwave another 5 minutes!. I would recommend this product for it's convenience and easy use of operation. Hope this helps."

It sounded great to have a pump that I did not have to hook up to and I could use anywhere in the house and I could move about as I pumped - if need be. Indeed it has an incredible latch down flow of milk. I was surprised how much milk came out and it was FAST! However, my nipples were so red and painful throughout the process and afterwards that I suspect my breast and my nipples were too large for the diaphragm.So I give it 5 stars for CONVENIENCE; 5 Stars for the 5 petal shaped massagers that produce milk faster and more naturally than any other pump"

I am now going to get rid of the Whisper Wear and only use this one!! I can get 4 ounces out of ONE breast in less than 5 minutes. This pump is fantastic!!

I gave up and bought a manual pump, that was my best friend. Not only was it compact, but it made less noise then this thing. If your looking for a good pump, get a manual one, it is more work but at least your not paying I think it was over $170.00(at the time) for something that will break and cannot find replacement parts for online. Who the heck has time to call their toll free number, be on hold for however long on minimal sleep. Can't waste my time like that."

Nice to include trace minerals and lots of vitamin C and E. But it's an energy bar for feeding an active body.Clif qualifies as a food substitute on some levels... as in case of sustained strenuous activity or if you are traveling in a country with lack of hygienic food service. But it's loaded with sodium (as much as 210 mg), fat (around 6 gms), and sugars (20 g). Great if you are rock-climbing like that athletic fellow on the package. NOT great if you are a car-driving, tv-watching, immobile dieter. Couch potatoes would do well to stay on carrot sticks, and earn Clif bar privileges once a heavy exercise regime is in place.It is recommended that consumer drink a large quantity of water with every Clif bar, and perhaps that, with their hefty fiber content, is why they can be so satisfying. But people with big appetites will probably be tempted to eat more."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I am a stay at home mom and my daughter is 4 days old when I purchased this pump. My husband is going out to sea and wanted to feed her before leaving so I wasnt even sure if I would get milk out with her being so young. I also didnt want to get a pump because I was afraid I wouldnt get any milk and that it would hurt like it did with a free pump that I had got when I delivered my son. This pump is great and even for me with larger breasts it was so easy to use and didnt hurt at all. I was able to get a good amount of milk without feeling like i was pumping to long and my husband was able to feed her.I am also going to get the warmer and the sterilizer. I would tell anyone who is looking for a pump to get this one.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,I've been happy with the EAS CarbControl bars I've purchased from Amazon. They're pretty fresh (sometimes the ones I get from WalMart are not so much) and I've always loved the product because they're so protein and fiber-heavy that they leave me satisfied until lunch. I just wish they'd stick to their flavors. Whenever I get to really liking one (like the old chocolate strawberry mousse - I really miss that one) they discontinue it and I have to find another. This is the best chocolate-flavored one I've found.
health personal care,health care,first aid,2.0,"After about two months of use, I have mixed feelings about these. Noticed a marked improvement in the height of raised scars (they are much smoother) but no improvements otherwise (in color/size), meaning scars that were not raised already have shown no improvement.Biggest complaint is that they just don't stick well. When you first open a new one, it will probably stick well for about a 12 hours (the recommended amount of time to wear one in a day), as long as you aren't too hairy (and I am, they peel off my arms right away). But you are supposed to be able to re-use them for several days - yet after the first day, they barely stick at all (the directions say to wash them every day with water - I was skeptical at first that this would help, but it actually makes them stick better - just not well enough). Don't even think about wearing them at night without tape - they will peel off and get lost (or stuck in your hair :P ).Overall:The Good:- seem to work well on raised scars- bandages are fairly large, by cutting them up i can cover 3 scars with one bandage- are good for about 5-6 days if you keep taping them downThe Bad- don't stick - whatever you pay for these, expect to pay about that much again in medical tape (i use scotch tape because i am cheap)- haven't helped with the color or size of scars (i don't really care that much, i was just curious if these would work - but for most people, i imagine this is the most important aspect)Final Word:2 stars, until I see more improvement. If you are particularly worried about your scars, I recommend seeing a dermatologist before you plop down 30 bucks for these."

The earplugs stay in quite well (some other brands i have tried fall out sometimes). Since now i am always the only one that remembers to bring earplugs, i am frequently giving out pairs to friends, and they all agree that they are as good as they come.On an interesting side-note, you can still hear people talking pretty well... i've never had to pull out my plugs to have a conversation with someone. I'm not really sure how well these work for filtering ambient noise (on an airplane, etc) because i haven't actually tried that, but they really work well for LOUD noise!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,dried fruit raisins,4.0,"The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them. They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous. If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry. So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth. I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries. Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the water."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I just had my baby 6 weeks ago and I wanted something I could use for occasional pumping. I was told that the Meleda electric pump was awesome so I purchased it. I tried to pump for over a hour and didn't get one drop out of it. The suction was horrible on it and did nothing for me. I asked the general manager of Babies R Us if I could return it if I had no luck, espically where it was $80. They told me they aren't suppose to return them once opened but they would go ahead and return it for me if it didn't work. After trying it and no luck, I returned it and purchased this pump. Can I say, I LOVE IT! I have had great results and it's so easy to use, and QUIET!! The Meleda electric pump was so loud it sounded like a razor going off! I'm not sure how much milk is normal to get out since everyone is different but on average I am able to get about 4 ozs out in about 15 minutes. I don't think I am a milking machine but I get enough out for my baby. I have noticed that since pumping, my milk has let down alot more and I am able to actually feel it let down now. The only 3 things that I don't care for is 1)The cushion around the funnel for the ""Let down"" effect. It seems to work best for me with out it on. 2) Your milk tends to drip out of the funnel and onto your clothes on occasion. 3)The suction comes loose sometimes and you have to start all over again. Overall, great pump and I have had great results. If you are thinking of purchasing a pump for occasional use, this is the pump. I would defenitly ask the store manager though before purchasing it, if it doesn't work, can it be replaced? If they say yes and they will let you return it, like they did me, then you know you aren't out the money if it doesn't work."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"The Isis Pump is the best. It takes a little effort at first. What I found was you are very unsuccessful if you don't use it correctly and have it assembled correctly. Rythmic pumping WITHOUT depressing the handle all the way works best--you have to experiment with positioning to get the best suction, it should not hurt if you are doing it correctly. Try pumping directly into bottles if you can instead of the storage containers-which can leak if not assembled correctly--Like the other reviewer I lost 7 ounces on the floor at 5am that way:( Finally, if I use it more than once in a day I store it in the fridge so I don't have to worry about cleaning it--then I just clean it the next day. Then I boil it once a week."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I own this pump and the Medela Pump in Style Advanced. There are pros and cons to each. I will share my thoughts on both so that hopefully you can make an educated decision about which one to choose.The Playtex pump breast shields are made from soft silicone, so they imitate the nursing baby more closely. The Playtex silicone shield gently presses the areola while drawing the nipple out and expressing milk. The Medela pump comes with hard plastic shields, so they do not press the areola while drawing the nipple out. As you may know, the gentle pressure on the areola is what stimulates both milk production and letdown. This feature of the Playtex pump was important to me because I pump exclusively (5-6 times a day) and it is vital that I keep my supply up. Using the Playtex pump seemed to increase/stabilize my supply.Also, because both pumps come with clear breast shields, I am able to see exactly how many nipple openings are releasing milk. Hands down, more openings are engaged with the Playtex pump.Another advantage of the Playtex over the Medela is that it comes with a car charger and several organization bags, as well as an ice pack for about the same price as the Medela or cheaper. One of the cons of the Playtex pump is that the breast shields themselves are larger than the Medela, and have more parts to assemble (4 parts make up one breast shield). I found that if I have not assembled the shields just right, it interferes with the suction. The Medela shields are smaller (easier to hold, especially for those with small hands), and only require two parts to assemble them. This also helps out when traveling.Another con of the Playtex pump is that I was unable to find many accessories for it in stores for immediate purchase. I had to go to [...] to order extra breast shields and other items, therefore I had to wait for them to ship. Lastly, I have had to contact both manufacturers for help with my products. When I contacted Playtex, they overnighted me the equipment I needed (I called at about 2pm one afternoon and got it at 8am the next morning...WOW!!! Great service). When I contacted Medela, they sent my items via Priority Mail, so it took 3 days for me to receive what I needed.Both pumps are excellent, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Playtex over the Medela simply because the soft silicone breast shield allows me to maintain my supply more easily. Sorry for being so long-winded, but I just wanted to share my experience with you about these products to help you make a better decision. Happy nursing, and remember"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I purchased these bottles after a friend of mine recommended them to me after using them herself for her baby. I have got to say that my baby has had no cholic or excess gas. I've heard many horror stories about cholic babies and anything that can help cut those chances down I am for. I have used these bottles from day 1 so I couldn't say for sure if these bottles did the job but all I know is my baby is happy with them. The only bad thing I would say is you definitely need at least 8-10 of these bottles unless you want to wash them over and over for each feeding. There are also many parts to these bottles to wash but considering what they do it's well worth it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"As 5-HTP goes, this is good stuff and reasonably priced. It does seem to cause vivid dreams and it seems to have the effects it is supposed to. However, it should be noted that although you need take only 2-4 capsules for insomnia, the short half life of 5-HTP from ""GRIFFONIA SEEDS"" necessitates rather frequent dosing for depression and appetite suppression, usually 4x per day and attention needs to be paid to the timing of doses with other amino acids. Serotonin syndrome may also be an issue for some.Whereas many important issues are not certain or resolved regarding 5-HTP dosage and usage, it does seem to do a lot of good when used appropriately. Naturally a lot more can be said and books have been written on 5-HTP. It is a product that must be used with considerable care and professional medical monitoring is advisable due to the serious conditions it is used for and its effects on human brain chemistry. [Depression, Obesity, Insomnia] Nevertheless after taking it for 3 years I can say that I have experienced no negative side effects. Also, I have noticed reduced cravings for sweets, less anxiety in social situations and have slept better than I ever have. There has also been no sign of 5-HTP being habit forming in my experience.If you are considering using this product for anxiety or sociophobic disorders the same company [NOW] makes a 200mg dosage combined with the amino acid L-tyrosine. Many have found the addition of 250 mg of L-tyrosine to be most helpful and the product still retains all of its other characteristics.PLEASE NOTE"

It's not about ""wanting"", it's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people. Unfortunately HOMEDICS didn't think it was important enough to investigate and immediately placed this spin campaign on the situation, but the US PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION found importance in the matter. I'm not saying Homedics is a horrible company and you shouldn't buy their products, I'm only stating that on August 17th 2005 my smoke detectors went off and when I went into my living room ""flames were shooting up from the Squush neck massager pillow"" that was sitting on my sofa and my house was destroyed, not to mention myself being injured and it almost killing my dogs. How does Homedics explain the ""electrical outlet behind the sofa"" (they claim arched)still being intact and unburned and not even melted? This is a review site, and that is my review! Anyone can draw their own conclusions and use the pillow at their own risk! My purpose is not to slam Homedics in this review, I just think people have the honest right to know what happened with the pillow at my home!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is one of my favorite ""fall back"" flavors of protein bar, among all brands. Why?1. They don't melt. I can leave one in my car for quick and efficient calories after a workout.2. Nice chocolate fix. If you eat many energy bars, you know that if the flavor includes the word ""brownie"" that its really not going to taste like a brownie, it will approximate the flavor as best as it can. Fortunately for Balance, their Almond Brownie flavor actually does pretty well in that regard. It is dense and fudge-like in its consistency with small almond chunks. You could let your mind wander for a minute and possibly think that you are eating a heavy brownie.The ingredients are not great, what with the sugar and artificial junk that's in it, but I don't eat them every day and neither should most people. They really are a candy bar with protein and vitamins, not a substitute for real food.For reference, my other favorite protein bar varieties in the non-melty category are"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"These little things are a nifty piece of gear to have, even if you have no physical needs that would require them.The balls have baffles in them, and these make a nice sound as they rotate and move. While making the sounds, there are small vibrations on your hand as the balls move.A point of note, is that you should start using them over a soft surface, such as a cushion or your sofa. It is common to lose one and have it fall when you first learn to use them. Dropping them on hard surfaces can damage them.Also, contrary to advice given sometimes, you should not shake them, as this can also damage the baffles inside.Start with two at the same time, and after some time, you can increase them to three or even four, (with one sitting on top of the bottom three).These balls really work, and after a few minutes, your hands and body will feel very relaxed. I was very surprised with the results, to be honest. They are also great for developing your hand skills in manipulating them without the ""clank"" of balls hitting together."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I gave this only 4 stars because it isn't a ""hot tub"", jacuzzi, or ""spa tub"". But, for around $35, I can enjoy a nice ""spa tub"" like bath. Yes, it's a little loud. Yes, it doesn't stick to the tub like you'd think it would with all the suction cups. However, I don't have a hot tub, I don't have a spa tub, I don't have a jacuzzi. I suffer from a painful muscle disorder, so I wanted something that might help ease the pain. With a little Epsom Salts, which you may use with this, this does the trick. When I first got in the tub, and had to wrestle with the mat to keep it down, I was doubting my purchase, but once I got settled, it was very relaxing and enjoyable. Some reviewers stated that the water doesn't stay hot. It says that in the literature, and I found that if I stay in it for the recommended 15-20 minutes, it stays hot enough. I did notice it shooting out cooler water toward the end, but I figured it was time to get out anyway. Would I buy it again? Sure, unless I can afford the real thing. It did what I wanted it to do, what more can you ask."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I have tried various bottles, including Avent and Dr. Brown's, and the Ventaire are my least favorite. They are currently stashed in the back of my cupboard and I would only use them if I had no others available. I do like the fact that the bottom of the bottle comes off for easy cleaning but I have found that unless you have the bottom disc centered exactly, the bottom leaks. Not a problem if you take the time to put it together correctly but in the middle of the night, I am lucky I can stand upright, let alone put a bottle with several pieces together. Also, you can't use these bottles in a bottle warmer and if you use a pan of water to warm them, the warm water collects between the disk and the bottom ring and drips out onto the baby during feeding. My biggest complaint - I absolutely hate the nipples. They are so hard and rigid! My daughter seems to have a lot of difficulty with them so I have simply put them away and started using the others. One good point - they are OK for water and/or juice, but this is because the hard, inflexible nipples don't allow for a fast enough flow. Overall, I would not buy them again."

I wanted a second pump to use in the mornings and on the weekends but did not want to purchase another large, expensive electric pump. I read the reviews of this item and ended up purchasing it. I love it - it's quick, easy, and gets the same amount of milk as my Pump in Style. It's wonderful to take with us wherever we go. I always keep it in my diaper bag and have even used it quickly in a public bathroom when there wasn't a sanitary place to breastfeed my daughter. This product is worth every penny."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"This pump is great. I received the Medela Pump in Style as a gift and was disappointed in it (I guess it is just not for everyone). I purchased this pump because I really needed something to pump while I was away and for when I go went back to work. I am able to pump twice as much than what I was able to get from the Medela Pump In Style in a half an hour. I was using using it when I returned back to work as well, but I needed something quicker since I pump at least 3 times a day, so I went and bought the Ameda Purely Yours (which happens to be a great pump) and I get just as much as I get out from the Avent pump, just within 10 minutes instead. I now use this pump at home while I leave the other one at work, and it still works out great."

Since I've started using the GoLite, I've been waking in the morning at the time I want, and getting sleepy at night. It is much easier to get to sleep and rise when I want to. The GoLite has worked fantastically for me. It is programmable, so when I sit down at my desk in the morning, I plug it in, and hit a button and it's on. It shuts itself off too. Only improvement I can think of for the GoLite is a button to ""Pause"" treatments. The GoLite is by far the best purchase I've made for myself, regarding health. Absolutely."

I suppose it's effectiveness may correspond with the severity of one's symptoms, which in my case were severe. I had pretty much every ailment associated with systemic candida. I had zero energy. My body felt chronically tight, achey and fatigued in much the same way one feels with the flu. I was seriously depressed, irritable and moody. I couldn't lose the weight from my last pregnancy.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We went to Babies R Us with the intentions to purchase a Graco high chair! But after feeling this one in comparison to the Graco chairs, this was way more comfortable. The padding is much more soft!Now that we have owned this high chair for quite some time, I have to say it was one of the best decisions we made concerning baby products. I'm not sure why some people say it's hard to remove with one hand. I have a VERY active baby so removing it and putting it back on with one hand is a cinch!It's very easy to keep clean. My son is a messy eater so food gets everywhere. But I've had no problem with keeping it clean! Also, I love the 5-point harness feature. That helps my son not to fall out as I remove the tray. He fits in it perfectly. I don't feel that the tray is too high either.All in all, this high chair is a must have and it's such a reasonable price too!"

When my grandson has a temperature, it's going to be too frustrating to not know if the thermometer is accurate, from 99.8 to 97.6 to 98.4 to 96.7 within less than a minute. That's too much of a variance to be reliable. I wouldn't recommend it."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Platex bottles are the best bottles when switching between the breast and bottle. I have health problems which makes nursing difficult, so there are periods when I have to feed my daughter expressed breast milk for weeks at a time. When she was a newborn, I went as long six weeks without breast feeding, and when I resumed breast feeding, my daughter latched on like she had been doing it all along. I have to say it's in part to these bottles and natura latch nipples. The liners can be pricy, but if you buy a store brand (like Target) you can save a little money- especially if you wait for them to go on sale and stock up! If you are planning on breast feeding and bottle feeding, I HIGHLY recommend these bottles!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I first used these bottles 5 years ago with my first child. They were styled a little differently the way you put the bottom vent in. I used the same bottles again 10 months ago for my second child and will be using the same ones in a few weeks with my third. They are the best. They are very easy to clean and we have never had one leak. I do like this new style. They are easier to put together than my old ones, so I am going to restock with these. I think they really helped prevent gassiness too. I would never use any other bottle."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"This is my third high chair and my child is only 7 months old! I started with the wooden Eddie Bauer because I liked the way it looked and it matched my decor. I returned it because it didn't recline, the height wasn't adjustable, it was hard and seemed uncomfortable, and it had no wheels. Plus, it didn't fold for storage. Next, I purchased the Evenflo Discovery High Chair. I loved most of the features (it reclined, the height was adjustable, it was a little more comfortable than the Eddie Bauer, it had wheels, and it folded for storage) except the seat was too deep and my child who is in the 95th percentile for height could barely see over the top. The activity center was way too loud and the graphics could not be seen by the baby. On that note they couldn't really be seen in a normally lit kitchen by anyone. The seat would never sit all the way up and I had to prop a pillow behind my baby at every mealtime which was ridiculous. When I returned it I was told there was no defect that is just how the chair is made. I doesn't keep your baby straight up. Finally, I brought my child to the store and sat him in the high chairs I was considering (below $100). I was so happy with the Baby Trend Palm Tree High Chair. It had ALL OF THE FEATURES I was looking for and it was super comfortable. Plus, it had shoulder straps, which when worn loosely added extra safety without restricting movement. This is the best choice in this price bracket. Trust me, I've road tested three of them!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"Unless you have 20 minutes to kill while your baby is screaming for a bottle, you don't want this. I first used this on a venture to BRU for a Grandparent's Day Breakfast and while Grandma was sitting in on a 529 seminar, my daughter suddenly discovered that she was beyond famished - so up we go out to the car to warm up a bottle! Now, supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us. First of all, the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on. Unless the bottle is a regular generic bottle with a gallon of fluid inside, it won't keep the heating latch engaged. I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes, the bottle was still ice cold! I have no idea how to warm a bottle in the car and have no reccomendations, but I will tell you that this mini blood pressure machine will do nothing to benefit the appetite of an impatient child when she's hungry!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I like strong dark roast coffee and this filled the bill nicely. Much better than the dark roast Senseo product. You need to be careful to center the pod in the single pod holder and to tap it down a bit. Otherwise, the final product can be a bit watery. It is not difficult to do--you just need to pay a little attention when inserting the pod.I have never tried to make 2 4-ounce cups sequentially as did the previous reviewer, but it does not surprise me that the second cup from the same pod was weaker. It is fairly logical to me that the strongest coffee would be the cup made on fresh grounds (just like a regular drip coffee maker). If you make a single 8 oz. cup or 2 4-ounce cups AT THE SAME TIME, the quality is very good.The best pod, in my opinion is the Kona coffee pod, also available on amazon. However, this one is a good everyday alternative for fans of dark roast coffee since it is quite a bit less pricey than the Kona pods."

My husband and I were devestated. The thought of NOT having a baby was beyond comprehension so I started doing research on methods of charting fertility and whatnot. I ran across this fertility monitor and after calculating the cost to buy the ""cheap"" stick (that you use w/o a monitor) I realized that after a few months of NOT concieving (not to mention the complications of READING them) that it would be a better deal to buy the CBFM. (Not to mention I resold it on E B A Y for 90% of the original purchase price) Regardless - I became preg. within 3 months of my miscarriage and 2 months of using this monitor. It's very quick and easy to use. NOt to mention it's good to get an idea of your cycle for AFTER a baby..lol We ended up getting pregnant on our HIGH fertility days not our PEAK.

This kit gives you an array of remedies for the baby that you could use.The only down side is that some of the products are for ages 2 and older....for a panicky mom at 3 am needing a decongestant it could be unnerving to read the drections and see that it's for an older baby and that you need a doctor's okay for a younger child....by the time the baby is 2 years old you are hardly a ""New PARENT"" and most over the counter medicines are available to use...This is the NEW PARENTS SURVIVAL KIT RIGHT?????...but other than that this is a wonderful tool to have in your home for those just in case moments."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I love this pump. I use it at work and in the car when we are on our way to church and I can pump about 6 ounces in 15-20 minutes. However, it took some practice. I started pumping three weeks before returning to work and started out getting about 1-2 ounces in 15-20 minutes. My advice to you is give this or any pump you try a good trial before deciding it doesn't work. Breastfeeding wasn't ""working"" for me either for about the first four weeks, but now I am so glad that I stuck with it.I had first tried an electric pump that I rented from the hospital and what I didn't like about it was the rhythmic pumping motion. It was really hard on my nipples. With the Isis pump, I can squeeze the handle a few times and hold it down while the milk just flows out. I control the pumping motion. It's great and my nipples aren't contantly rubbing on the sides of the plastic.This pump is also easy to take apart, clean (I use the microwave sterilizer) and put back together. It comes with extra parts, which is nice. And I also like that I can pump right into the bottle, put a nipple on it and it's ready to go. So convenient.I highly recommend this pump."

It has a great ergonomic shape that allows you to hold it in comfort, and it flexes in the middle to work with you angles and curves. I have used it on my head to massage my scalp, and it is the perfect shape for this. Your spouse can use this on knots in your back.

My personal steamer travels easily with me, tucked into the corner of a carry-on size suitcase. When you're on the road presenting or performing, it can be a life saver. Much better than a towel over your head and a pan of boiling water too (and safer). I recommend personal steamers to all my voice students.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This pretty little toy is a variation on that old standby, the torpedo-shaped vibrator. Like the other members of the Natural Contours family, this vibrator was designed by a woman for women, and it shows! The Jolie is waterproof, with a gentle bend in the middle, and a smoothly angled tip. It requires one AA battery.Now, as for vibration, the Jolie has only one speed, and it is high-frequency and gentle. So, if you are looking for intense vibes, then this is not for you. Also, like too many vibrators, the batteries have a tendency to rattle in this one, making it too noisy. I tried adding a piece of facial tissue, and it did help, but it is still a little too noisy.But, that said, I do like this vibrator, and recommend it. If you are looking for a gentle vibrator that seems to have been designed directly for your body, then you will like the Jolie."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I can't say enough good things about this chair. First of all, the neutral colors are great. They would work well with any home. The reclining feature is wonderful. We used this feature more than I thought we would. We bought this chair when our son turned 4 months old. He could sit up on his own, but only for a short while, so when we would feed him, we could slightly recline the seat. This made it so much more comfortable for him (and us!). The height of the chair adjusts...again another feature I didn't think that we would use, but we have taken much advantage of that bell and whistle! And of course, wheels. Trust me, wheels are a must have! In the very beginning, the tray seemed a little high, I guess, but absolutely no higher than the other chairs at BRU (I research everything before I buy, and I researched chairs on- line for weeks before going to the store for test runs). The fabric does get messy, but I think that has a lot to do with my messy eater. Some people complain about not being able to dry it, but that hasn't been a problem with me either. I throw it in the wash after dinner, lie it on the ironing board before bed, and it's dry in the morning. Please don't let washing the pad be an issue, because this chair is GREAT! My son is 1 year old now, we have washed the cover once every one or two weeks (as needed), and it looks perfect still. My friend bought the pretty wooden Eddie Bauer (sp?) chair for $99 dollars and hates it. It is way to heavy. It has no wheels either, so she has to carry it around. She saw my chair and is going out to buy one tomorrow."

Also in wafer form it is more effective as it combines with saliva to react positively in the gastric tract. [DGL Wafers]DGL VS. CIMETIDINE:Studies have shown that in comparison to ""Cimetidine"", the DGL wafers worked slower but effected more of a healing action against peptic ulcers.

But I decided to go with this one since its reviews were good and I am so glad I did. I love the automatic shut off function and the beep when it is finished. Like anything else, you have to use good sense and adjust the amount of water according to how much in the bottle and check the temp before giving it to baby but I have easily learned to estimate the amount of water needed based on the amount in the bottle. This is definitely something you will want if you are heating bottles !!!"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet!"

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,The packets are great to use along with this system of sinus rinsing. They are easier than mixing your own which I have done for the past year. It's a lot more expensive though. So to save money you could use the packets just for travel or when you are in a hurry. The correct proportions for do it yourself though are

It has NO suction!I took it apart and re assembled 3-4 times each time and have tried using it over a course of 2 weeks now... and still no matter what I try NO SUCTION.I went and bought another one and returned the first thinking it was defective, but same thing, it pulls nothing from my breast and I can not even feel any pulling. I have ample milk supply and can easily express by hand.Save your time and money , do not buy this pump."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"it has a few serious design flaws:1. The tray cannot be adjusted to fit snug against our child when she is sitting in the chair.2. It does not have a lip on the tray on the side facing the baby and since it does not fit snugly, would allow all of the food to end up in her lap or on the floor.3. The seat height cannot be adjusted to the height of a normal kitchen counter top/breakfast bar - a critical feature common in most high chairs.So we returned it."

The scent is very aromatic and long lasting. I had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house. I was very pleased.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I really looked forward to this product and had high hopes for it. My husband gets very hot at night and I thought this was the answer for him... I even decided to purchase one for myself as I had heard such good things about it.We used them for about a month - First we tried them inside the pillow case - that was useless - you cannot even feel any coolness unless it is ON TOP of your pillow. Also, it never really got cold - I had slightly better success by placing mine in the freezer for 20 minutes (my husband never put his in the freezer...) before I went to bed, however, when we awoke in the morning, the chillo was hot and so were we. (Also, having to remember to place your chillo in the freezer every night is a real drag!)Additionally, after about a month, my husband woke up around 1am drenched in water! It seems that the plug came undone and all the water came out! We let the chillo (and the bed) dry and then put water back in it according to the instructions. Aparently, there is some kind of chemical or something in the chillo, because refilling it was to no avail. We could not get it to work at all after that and it looked like a plastic bag filled with water (it never flattened out and ""absorbed"" the water again... and the instructions do not talk at all about refilling it...)I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product and would not recommend it to anyone..."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands, you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too. Then, place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands. Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts, but these don't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves.~The Rebecca Review"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"My first order of alohaislandcoffee.com was the Light Roast 100% Kona pods. I had just bought the Bunn My Cafe machine. The coffee tasted bitter to me, not smooth like I'd hoped. I was ready to return the Bunn My Cafe and give up on pod coffee. I called Anita at Alohaisland and she talked with me and gave me great info on over-extraction, pod brewers, Kona, different roasts. She asked me to hold on the Bunn one more week and she would send me a sample pack with more pods so I could decide. She assured me that the Bunn My Cafe was not the reason I didnt like the Light Roast Kona. Anita was correct! After trying 4 more flavors(Choco Macadamia Nut, Dark Roast, Espresso, and Hazelnut)we loved them all! Finally we had the rich smooth coffee that we had hoped for. If you are not sure which flavor pods to order first, just call Alohaisland, talk with them and they will help you decide. I have loved Dunkin Donuts coffee for years, thinking it was a light roast. I learned that its a dark roast and thats why I didnt like the Light Roast Kona. I highly recommend the Chocolate Macadamia Nut pods!!!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"When my 10 month old had diarrhea for two weeks and developed truly horrifying diaper rash, a friend of mine who is an RN turned me on to this stuff. It began working IMMEDIATELY! The rash healed completely after just a few days with calmoseptine, though it previously had gotten worse and worse with my use of other assorted diaper rash creams. A little goes a LONG way, so I think a 4 oz. tube would last through several children's diaper years."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,3.0,"I ordered this on a whim, mainly because there was a $20 rebate for it, bringing the price down to $29.99.My initial taste reaction was that it was surprisingly very good. Carbonated... and, I can't really describe the rest of the taste, but I just liked it. I did feel as if I also felt better overall because of the B-vitamins.Over time, drinking two a day, a week or so into it, the taste started getting annoying, like I was getting tired of it. I stopped drinking it for a week or so, and the first can tasted fine again.As for the price, this is NOT worth $50 for 24 cans. It was, however, worth the $30 after rebate."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"I own this thermometer, the braun ear thermometer and a safety first thermometer. This one is by far the best. It is the perfect size and fit in your hand, and there is like no chance of inserting it too far. It gives a quick accurate reading and really just works so good. the safety first one works but is long and skinny, alittle scary putting in a babies behind! Ane I have to be honest I have never used the ear thermometer because generally the DR. wants a rectal because it is the most accurate and they say the ear thermometers are really hard to use, so I wouldn't recommend wasting the money on it. Get this one, you won't be sorry!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Being a nursing mom, I was very concerned that bottles would complicate the latch habits of my new daughter. The nipples that come with my breast pump tended to collapse on her during meals, and she just couldn't seem to get comfortable on them, since they need a completely different mouth position than nursing. Playtex VentAires to the rescue! (Imagine superhero music playing here.) The VentAire nipples were immediately familiar to my daughter and she was able to nurse well. Not only that, but I noticed that after a few feedings with the VentAire bottles, which encourage a baby to open very wide for the nipple, that her latch when actually nursing was much improved. The bottles had actually gotten her in the habit of opening wide wide wide, much more so than by nursing alone. So I can honestly say that these bottles improved our non-bottle nursing experience as well. I can't say enough good things about this product. If your baby is going to be both nursing and taking the occasional bottle, look no further."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,4.0,"XLNT product, but Amazon has just bumped the price up by $5 a box. (currently $17.95)...thats $1.12 per bar. Out of my price range :(The last time I ordered these a few months ago, all flavors were $12.95/box."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"Luna Bars taste and smell like the stuff I use to feed my tropical fish i.e. some sort of nutrition blend disguised as bars (for my fish, flakes). But for something to grab on the go or someone with a busy schedule who doesn't have time to cook (or eat elaborate meals), the nutrition blend of vitamins and minerals offered by this bar is quite remarkable."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"WOW!! What an amazing journey this past 18 weeks has been. I always dreamed of being thin again someday, but didn't know if it was truly possible. However, I never dreamed I would lose this much weight in only 18 weeks. When I started this journey I weighed a whopping 195 lbs and today I am a slim 135 lbs. Thanks to Lipovarin for being such an amazing product! I recall the afternoon that I went to go pick up my developed ""before"" photos. As I sat in my car pouring over the embarrassing photos, it was a harsh realization that I had let time get the best of me and I desperately needed to get my weight under control. It was painful looking at those photos, nonetheless, it was the spark that I needed and motivated me to get started NOW!!In the beginning I was a bit skeptical to take any type of dietary supplements. However, once I started taking lipovarin I was pleasantly surprised at how much it curbed my appetite. My weakness with food has always been portion sizes. For the first time I felt like I had control over what I ate and how much I ate. I started to eat smaller portions combined with an overall healthier diet and daily exercise and the results are still shocking. Today, I feel much happier, sexier, energetic, and my self-esteem and self-confidence have skyrocketed. More importantly, I'm a better mother and role model for my children.Recently, I attended a meeting with many of my colleagues who had not seen me for a few months. The reaction was amazing. Literally, nobody recognized me and once they did everybody wanted to know the secret to my weight loss. I feel as though I have discovered the fountain of youth and I have been able to turn back the hands of time by about 15 years.It is difficult trying to juggle all of life's daily demands with the pressures of working full-time and raising two young toddlers. But it's just as difficult trying to live life in a body you're not comfortable with either. Lipovarin helped me show that I am living proof that a woman approaching 40 can regain that 20-something body. Today people refer to me as ""tiny,"" ""small,"" and ""skinnie minnie."" These adjectives are uplifting and motivate me to continue on this path for a lifetime. Although this contest has come to an end, for me this is just the beginning.I feel like a butterfly that has hatched from it's cocoon ready to experience all that life has to offer. I am now truly living life to it's fullest and no longer just surviving.....but thriving! Taking lipovarin on a daily basis, I know that I now have control over food and food no longer has control over me."""
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,When I think about the huge plug in sterilizer that my mother had for me and my siblings as a baby. A sterilizer that seemed to take forever to clean and run I am still amazed that all you have to do is pour in water and stick it in the microwave. It also makes a great drying rack if you wash your bottles by hand instead of running them through a dishwasher. It saves so much time to just put them right into it as you wash them and everything stays organized. As a mom getting ready to have my second child in a few weeks I thank the baby industry for life simplifying non-essentials.
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"For anyone who has unexplainable congestion that only really bothers you during sleep, these are the best. I tried lots of ""snore relief"" products, but none worked. The only thing that worked besides this was Afrin, but you can't use that everyday or you get permanent nasal damage. These strips go on quick and hold well assuming you have washed your nose with soap and water RIGHT beforehand. I don't ever want to sleep without them again."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I did some extensive research on pumps while I was pregnant knowing that my maternity leave was going to be short. When my son was born, he had difficulty latching on and I started to pump everything for him. Within a week the pump was suctioning but not pulling any milk. At first I thought it was me, until I tried a manual pump and expressed 6 oz in 15 minutes.We called the company and they told us to boil the parts again and see if that helped. It worked for 2 oz and then quit again. Called the company again and they said they would ship new pieces to us since it must be a problem with the seal. However, they would not express ship and we had to wait 8 days for the parts. In the meantime, we rented a Medela from the hospital.At this point, I wish we had just rented to begin with. I was so engorged while trying to figure out the pump problem and lost some of my milk supply. Not to mention the stress of thinking something was wrong with me that I could not feed my baby!While it was working it worked well, but that was only for a little while and the company was def. not as responsive as I would hope a company who helps provide food for infants would be."

That's going to be a hard one to kick because I have unfortunately been with this awful habit for nearly 35 years.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,3.0,"The dominant flavor of the Chai Tea bars is Cardamom. Although it contains tea, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, etc., they have not really balanced the flavors, and you will likely notice only the cardamom flavor. If you're thinking this bar will taste like tea, forget it. Emphasis strongly on the word Chai, not Tea. (Chai tea is flavored with cardamom and other spices.) If you don't know what cardamom tastes like, it's one of the staple spices of Indian cooking, comes in pods with small black seeds (which, by the way, are great to drop in a cup of coffee...) I'd advise you to buy a bar somewhere and try it, before you buy a box; some will truly love its exotic, spicy flavor; others may despise it."

The plastic top tray unsnaps so that you can clean the dirty part of the tray in a second. My son is 9 months old and 21 pounds, he doesnt have any problem fitting into this high chair and still has plenty of growing room. Please, don't waste your money on other fancy high chairs that recline, change positions, or have silly toys on them. They will leave you with more things to clean when your little sweetheart gets their breakfast or dinner in every imaginable crack and crevice of your snazzy high chair. High chairs aren't for naptime or entertainment anyway, so whats the big deal about this one not reclining or having 5 star entertainment on board? I highly recommend this high chair to anyone looking for a chair that gets feeding time done!"

When you have a new baby, you have tons of laundry, sterilizing, and feedings. Who wants to add to that by having to clean a 5 piece bottle????If you ask me these bottles are very time consuming and they don't seem to do what they are meant to do- reducing spit-up and digestion."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I love this seat. If I had it to do over, I would have purchased this alone and no high chair! The seat is portable, easy to clean (love the ability to put trays in the dishwasher), and sturdy. We've used the seat on all kinds of chairs- restaurant, kitchen, dining room, outdoor. My daughter loved the seat so much if we left it on the floor, she used to sit in it, close the straps and sit (and then ask to get out and then climb back in). She now sits in it at the table without the tray to eat meals. I've compared this seat to other similar types of portable seats - I like this one the best for ease of portability, size (it's compact, but comfortable for a toddler), and cleanliness. The tray with insert is a little small, but not really a major drawback. It's also a good option for keeping at Grandma and Grandpa's house for visits (and can be easily tucked away when not in use)."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I also do not have the pump suctioned to the bowl, and with the pump setting on medium, plus a careful arrangement of rocks, I can create any level of water sound I'm in the mood for, and I have to lean so close to the fountain I'm practically drinking from it before I hear any motor noise.This fountain does have a not-so-pretty side, so I put it on a bookshelf underneath a window. I guess it might not work as a centerpiece, but 3/4 of it is very pretty to look at, and it came with two good size bags of rocks, plenty if you leave the ugly side alone.Also, even if you overfill this fountain there's almost no splashing and no leaking out of the bottom either. I have it running all day long at work (up to 10 to 12 hours at a time), and it's very consistent, I only have to add filtered water occasionally. I've gone through MANY fountains, and this is the best one out there, more than worth the price."

Going out to eat, you never know how clean the tables are, and I don't like the thought of her food sitting on whatever cleaning products were used.

I even get compliments from waitstaff for using it. Gives them less to scrape off... ha, ha. Definately worth it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,My whole family loves balance bars as a quick way to get a breakfast start when there isn't a lot of time. We used to get them at Trader Joes. My youngest son and myself love the mocha chip the best. My other two like them too but I can get them a couple of other flavors. They stopped carrying any of our favorite flavors at Trader Joes. I decided to try a find them directly- online. When I did they came up on your site which we consider reliable and trust worthy and you had a good price and shipping deal. So we can't miss. Just don't buy too many at once so we don't get them too stale. The first shipment seemed like they may have been on the truck awhile. But we love them and have orded on 3 occassions and plan to again.Thanks.Lisa

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Back problems are something new to me and this is just what I needed to relieve the ache. The vibration seems to really help relax muscle spasms and the heat is also soothing. It is well worth the price.
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,I love luxury gift items for babies. This is something they will have forever and pass down to their children's children. Great price on a classic item! Regular shipping was prompt.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I love these Balance Bars. The honey yogurt peanut flavor is the best I've tried, and they are great with a glass of cold, skim milk for breakfast or a snack. Without the milk, they aren't very filling, it's true, but they are still very tasty and better for you than candy. However, it's also true that since they are made with HFCS they aren't as healthy as some of the other bars available. They probably have a fairly high glycemic index.Still, if that's not an issue for you, and you want to soothe a sweet tooth, or find a fairly healthy fast breakfast or snack for on the go, give 'em a try. Btw, some people have complained about the price - here in NYC they go for nearly $2 per bar, making Amazon's prices amazing!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I purchased this pump reluctantly to use occasionally at home during my maternity leave. I have been using it for three months now and I use it at least once or twice a day. It is easy to use and after some practice, can pump up to five ounces in 15-20 minutes. I highly reccommend this pump!!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,IN A NUTSHELL
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Fabulous massaging cushion. It actually feels like real fingers massaging and kneading your back.
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This stuff is so good it's scary. I've used it 3-4 times in the past couple of days since I got it, and already the dead, thick ugly skin under my nails (that I used to emery-board down when I could) is a little softer and comes out easier with a tool (Tweezerman Pushy & ingrown nail file). Nails are a little whiter, too. (They weren't/aren't as yellow as the ones pictured in the ""before"" photos on the product's box.) I swear they're even a little less ridged on top.If you've struggled with thick undernail/fingertip skin, but have found that antifungals don't work (rightly so, because excess keratin isn't fungal) you'll love this product!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been using this product for two years. It is an excellent product because it contains all the nutrients in a good ratio plus additional herbs. I no longer have to swallow numerous pills to get the nutrition supplements I want, I only have to take two tablespoons once a day and it tastes good. It helps to maintain my health and gives me energy. An excellent product!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"Okay, General Tso's isnt exactly gourmet, and I know that its probably the #1 dish ordered at chinese take out places by americans who think its the epitomy of chinese cuisine. I will only eat it if its on some buffet and it looks fresh, a coworker of mine that will remain nameless always calls it ""Admiral Chos"" and we laugh at her everytime. ANYWAY, I was making stir fry over rice and needed a new taste and decided to try this bottle of Iron Chef, I mean how could Morimoto steer me wrong? It was actually a good blend of spicy and sweet, it blended well with the chicken and cabbage and onions. I did not make the traditional fried Tso's because lets face it, fried things are bad for you. I cant wait to try the other ""flavors"" of Iron Chef sauces!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I bought this based on Consumer Reports Health page , it ranked at the top of all the diet pills . They gave it a 96 out of 100 score. It does work , for me it does anyways , im a big snacker and i find this kills that for me. I have no desire to snack taking this product and i am only taking 3 pills in the afternoon to try and kill my evening / late night snacking habit. It has worked better then i thought it would.Of course with the no snacking im also losing weight , which is what i wanted to do."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"There are only two kinds of coffee I love, one is Starbucks French Roast, and the other is Starbucks Espresso (ground from whole bean.)The richness in each of the above is fantastic, and I love making a pot every day, then adding my favorite flavors which is always purely enjoyable.I always buy this brand because it taste so fresh, and I've tried just about every brand on the market over the last couple of decades. Nothing comes close to this brand, and this particlular roast, except for Starbucks espresso. They really are the best!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have been using the cannister for 2 years with excellent results. I use it to store a small supply of ground coffee, and am ordering a second cannister to store whole beans after I've opened the bag.I, too, experienced the ""losing the vacuum seal"" that some reviewers have noted. In my case, I grind exceedingly fine, and if I allow some of the find-ground coffee up on the cannister sides where the seal fits, the seal will not hold. I routinely just run my finger around the inside top of the cannister after adding new grounds to remove the thin dusting of coffee, and have not had the problem. I do occasionally rinse the lid with water, but very rarely. I highly recommend this product."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"This nice mask fits me just fine, and does a great job of blocking out the light. It is nice and soft and comfortable, which makes sleeping with it quite easy. As for erotic play, the same properties which make it great for sleeping (effective light blocking, comfortable, soft) makes it a great tool. I highly recommend this mask!(Review of Infinity Sleep Mask)"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"Like most people, my exerience with sleep aids is limited to Nyquil and Tylenol PM, which work ok, but aren't made for regular consumption.I have heard that melatonin doesn't work on some people, but it definitely works on me. Its effects are slightly more subtle than you might expect. It is much more pleasant in comparison to other chemicals. I do have to take 6 mg, but I am a big guy.The best part, by far, is that there is no hangover or tiredness the next morning. I can take two and won't feel terrible if I get only 6 hours of sleep."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This products provides excellent lumbar support. The heat and massage features are very soothing. Perfect for the people who suffer with low back pain. It is a must have for road trips.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,Super product at a great price. Why go to the supermarket when you can get these at Amazon for less money?
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,These are definitely for lounging in and not for walking in. I took them on a weekend scrapbooking retreat and used them constantly. Wonderful produt!
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"I received this item as a gift, after mentioning to a friend that I had loaned my Graco Travel Lite clip-on highchair (see below) to someone and never got it back. My husband and I were immediately baffled as to how the Hippo could be marketed as ""portable"" and shown on the box being easily toted in a carrying bag. Sure, it can be placed in the bag, but only after being completely disassembled! Disassembling it requires pushing in little buttons that are buried under the fabric of the seat. The legs do fold inward without being removed for somewhat easier carrying, but they don't lock in the collapsed position, so they constantly swing back out while being carried. Even with the legs collapsed inward, it is awkward to carry, especially while also carrying a diaper bag, purse, and BABY. The chair does seem comfortable, though, thanks to lots of padding and fabric. However, the fabric must be removed and machine washed to be cleaned, and there are a bunch of snaps that must be reckoned with to do so. My husband and I disliked this chair as soon as it came out of the box, but thought we would give it a chance. After one use traveling with it, we vowed never again. I am about to order a new Graco Travel Lite, which was my very favorite baby product with my first child. The Travel Lite is truly portable, folds easily and FLAT, is a breeze to carry, has a removable tray (which the Hippo does not!), and has a vinyl seat that is easily wiped clean. I strongly recommend the Graco version to anyone who is looking for a portable, clip-on highchair. We loved our Graco and can't wait to receive our new one!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I ordered this product just last month and let me tell you it is the best that I have ever had. I have problems with my spine and I was looking and looking for a product that I did not have to take internally. I was in a car accident a few years ago and never fully recovered from it. I have trouble with my upper back muscles that then to pull on my spine a great deal. I use this product and it sooths that pain and I can go about my daily activities. I even found the companies web site that is www.bluestuff.com that has a lot of other products as well. You will not be sorry that you tried this product really for any pain that people have. SuperBlue takes the pain away so I can have a life!!!!!
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"Just like the other reviewer, I had the biggest hairy wart on my butt. But wart away was juicy on the wart. And it melted it away. Now my butt is smooth as silk. And smells minty fresh too!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have the larger sized Cold Pack and just LOVE it. I've recently injured my back, and the large pack spanned my whole lower back--providng pain relief and accelerated healing.The packs are pliable and easy to use"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,The massager was received in good condition. It was easy to hook up and use. It gives a nice neck and shoulder massage and is a good value for the money.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I have been purchasing these Depends from Amazon.com for my mother over a year now, and am very, very pleased with all aspects of the ordering process, arrival time, quality and quantity of this product. My invalid mother lives 145 miles away from me, but being able to order these Depends and having them shipped right to her front door is wonderful. I searched for the best deal on these Depends, in stores and on-line, and this is ""as good as it gets""."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"My son, age 9, has always had sweaty little feet and hands! His skin in between the toes and even on his fingertips gets very sore---the skin peels and appears red and ""raw"".We have tried EVERY type of antifungal medication and these swabs are the ONLY thing that works. It takes away the discomfort immediately and it will be healed overnight. Absolutely amazing!!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I am in love with this pump - I just started back to work after a 12 week maternity leave and was in need of a good breast pump to continue nursing my daughter. I couldn't decide whether to bite the bullet and purchase a Medela Pump in Style or this one. I have had an electric pump in the past (First Years Dual Pump) and really didn't care for it - it was so noisy, at times wouldn't have great suction, as ws awkward to handle while breastfeeding my baby on one side. I felt like I was constantly prisoner to the electric outlet sine I couldn't move anywhere since it was so comlicated to get everything together.This pump was quiet, fast (8 ounces in under 15 minutes from both breasts) and needed no electric outlet. At first I was afraid my hand would get sore, but no problem at all. I had better luck w/out the petal cushion - this just didn't work for me, and I've never had a problem stimulating letdown without it.I am so glad I didn't purchase a PIS, I also love the bottles, they're the only kind my baby will use!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"I have also fallen in love with these cookies but have recenlty been remanced again by them. While in the Crown room for Delta I was pleasantly surprised to see these cookies in a larger size and in a 2 pack. Same wonderful flavor and crunch but in a larger cookie. Love the idea, not as many wrappers to unwrap.Haven't received my order yet thru amazon so can't comment on condition of cookie after shipped."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is the best brand for making my Pug's dog bones. She gets all the vitamins along with the great favor.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This warmer works quickly and warms the bottle evenly and to the perfect temperature. If I start it just when the baby starts to fuss, the bottle is warm well before complete hysteria sets in. And I have had no worries about hot spots or over-heated bottles.The only gripe I have is that it does not have a timer... but I am now in the habit of popping the bottle into the warmer then turning on my normal kitchen timer. It would be really nice if it were built in, though."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I thought I would love these bottles when I first got them, boy was I wrong!!! First, you really have to check the nipples because they are perforated and you have to actually make sure the nipple holes are open. Second, after a few times of washing the bottom leaks!! This is the worst thing about them, after putting freshly pumped milk in there it was all over my counter! Talk about disappointment. I have other family member who have the same complaint about them. Seriously think about another bottle when purchasing!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"The table warmer is very easy to use and it works, it's a good buy."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"My girlfriend recommended these bottles for my fourth baby. I had always used Playtex bottles with great success when transitioning from breast to bottle. Unfortunately, that was not the case with Avent. I found that my newborn sucked in too much air, and the lack of flow control on the nipple didn't help - I had never had a child spit up so much and so often. I found myself nursing him after a bottle feed. Thankfully the Avent was a ""loaner"" item from a friend and I have now replaced all the bottles with Playtex."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,2.0,"I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about. But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off. Plus when we were all done, I had to try to clean it off as best I could, then put it in my diaper bag-yuck!I much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Don't be fooled by the simple packaging of this mixed spice. This is not a simple flavor.If you like the steaks served at a certain ""Australian"" styled steak house you may well like this seasoning. A friend of mine introduced it to me at a little cook out, where he rubbed a generous amount on some new york strip cuts and grilled, and I fell in love. He then told me that this was the above mentioned steak house's secret seasoning for it's steaks, him claiming to know this by having worked their for a time. I know he had worked at just about every chain restaurant at some point, but that's about all I can confirm in regards to this rumor one way or the other as I've never had a steak there, nor worked at one. Regardless of the truthfullness of that statement, I can firmly attest to fact that this is an excellent mixed spice.I've used it on just about every type of meat except sea food, though I suspect it would be good on that too, with a noteable preformance on eggs. It is mildly spicey and fairly salty, but not overpowering unless you really load up.Reminds me of cajun seasonings in simular packaging, but is not as ""hot"". I highly recommend a good cut of beef, pan fried in olive oil with a generous amount of Cavender's Greek Seasoning rubbed in.It is also priced very well, and one container is more then enough to last a while. If you for some reason don't love it, you won't be out very much money and if you end up loving it as much as I do, you'll have plenty of it to last you a long time. A seasoning every kitchen should have!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"This stuff doesn't crackle at all. Plus it grows awfully tedious after the third spoonful, like trying to eat a whole bag of those circus peanut candies."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I have been taking Prilosec OTC for quite awhile now. After trying many other products with no results. Prilosec OTC seemed to be the only one that worked and keeps on working around the clock.Prilosec OTC Is the only Acid Reducer Medicine I buy now and I highly recommend for anyone to give It a shot and see If you don't agree after trying It.It does state on the box, that the product shouldn't be taken for the required number of days. You can take this product as long as you need to, but consult with your Doctor before you do.I've learnt this after consulting with my Doctor and he said that I could take this for as long as I needed.Which I was very pleased, because I couldn't Imagine not being to continue on daily without Prilosec OTC."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,"When did the rooster on the box get a cartoony face? Whatever happened to that wonderful abstraction? First they ruined Tony the Tiger, now this.And where did all the high fructose corn syrup come from? Admittedly, it is a flake of corn but that is a nasty ingredient to be skipped at all costs.It's things like that which drive people to the formerly odd grains like spelt and kamut!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"I had been looking for a product for when we're driving that won't get the snack all over the place. This does pretty well at keeping it contained; sometimes there are still goldfish crackers in my 2yr old daughter's carseat - but that's more because of her and not the container! This does the best job that I could find - an open container just does not work! The only thing ""negative"" is that is does seem to ""scrape"" her fingers. And I hesitate to even say ""scrape"" because it's not a true scrape, but after using this her fingers are red and raw. Other than that it's a pretty useful product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blending of this top quality tea. The black teas utilized are, as the box states, ""the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya, Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India."" These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend.The fragrance of Tazo Earl Grey is powerfully floral, in particular lavender, citrus, and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. The flavor of this splendid potion is refreshing and perfumed. The addition of cream creates a lush sensual brew. A topnotch tea blend!Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,This tea has a sweet fruity scent reminiscent of melon as it is brewing. The flavor is very mild and soothing--a lightly sweet chamomile flavor. A good choice for drinking a low caffeine beverage and still receiving the health benefits of drinking green tea. Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Although these are fat free, they were much to sweet to my taste. Sugar can be just as bad as fat for you... but for being fat free, they are good for those of us who get an hunger attack for something wont make you feel TOO guilty. I can only take it in very small portions because of its sugar content."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,This pump worked for about a week. It kept getting milk sucked into the motor and finaly it just died. I should have known. I bought a meleda single pump to replace it and it works great. I didn't pay full price for this thankfully so I just threw it away.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I was excited about this pump based on a presentation during my childbirth/breastfeeding class. I fell in love with it in the first few weeks of using it because its as comfortable as other reviewers said. Sadly, after using it for two months (2 times a week when I went to work) the motor gave out! Playtex replaced the motor at no charge only for it to burn out again in three months. After my one year warranty runs out in June, I'll most likely have to buy another pump. Stick with what's tried and true...Go Medela."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I had a similar neck pillow made by another company- which got lost on a plane, train, or...somewhere else along the way on a recent trip. I was very glad to find this!These pillows are filled with rice and buckwheat, which comform to your body and provide much better support than foam, air, just about any other material.We bought 3, (2 ""travel"" and one ""spa"") and are very happy with them. The fleece provide warmth, and this one (the twilight crush) stays nice and cool (better when you're in the tropics ;) (the fleece will be held for use in travel).I'm adding this review for those who can't tell the difference between the various pillows offered (as the descriptions are pretty sparse). I believe the fill is the same on all of them. (so they should all be microwabeable). They all have removable covers, and so, are washable. The fleece retains warmth better, and the smooth fabrics stay cool. beyond that, i can't tell the difference between the ""travel"" and ""spa"" pillows.These are very well made, and a real bargain at this price!One other thing to consider if you are buying this as a travel pillow. It's pretty substantial (weighty), and might be more than some want to carry....but they are so much more comfortable than air pillows, and really good if you have neck or back problems."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"My wife had a lot of trouble pumping milk during the first ten days after delivery.I called Medela customer service and told them the Pump-In-Style was not working. They offered to send us a brand new pump in exchange for our existing one, that we could then return to Amazon to get our money back.We decided to try it out some more, and it started working quite effectively after a few days. There is some medical literature giving evidence that breast pumps can be ineffective just after a caesarean.In any case, now we have a nice product from a company that gives great customer service."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,I read on here that people were very disatisfied after taking it for a few days(get real)and in a few weeks. You have to give the product time. The first month..I felt nothing..the 2nd month..wow! I was a new person...and I have lost 22 lbs to boot!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together.Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.~The Rebecca Review"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"We loved this product from the start, until it started to fail. The mechanism that allows you to remove the chair from the table kept getting tighter and tighter on one side. Eventually, it would not budge and the chair had to be sawed off our table. I contacted the manufacturer, Chicco, and they gladly shipped me another chair. Sadly, 4-5 months later, the new chair they sent us did the same thing. Now I have another chair stuck on my table.It is very disappointing because we love the product otherwise. It is great having our daughter sit at the table with us. I also love the low back on the chair because it makes a great hair-styling chair. The back is too high on the high chair and I have difficulty getting at my daughter's hair to put it in pigtails and trim her bangs.Like I said, it is too bad because the concept is great, but the design is poor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I've been on just about every diet imaginable!! Slim fast left me hungry in about 30 minutes and spiked my carb levels! The Atkins diet made me sick for about two months and I gained 10 lbs more then what I lost when I went off the diet! I was so drained and tired all the time!Herbalife is based on protein! Protein is what drives our hunger.. I guess I should say the lack of protein. Herbalife isn't about quick fixes or some kind of magic pill that wouldn't work any, it's about Living Herbalife Lean! Not two days or two months but, they provide medical information on how to change your eating habits forever! No more dead end diets for me!! Be careful who you buy from though. I've seen Herbalife products fairly cheap on Amazon and Ebay, I'm an Independent Distributor myself and Herbalife doesn't approve, endorse or even allow mass selling so watch the expiration dates! You also might end up paying for something that they won't be able to provide when their license is revoked or find out that it's been handled by a variety of people exposed to temperature extremes."

I like it strong so I brew it with two bags for at least 20 minutes and then reheat.In addition to the delicious flavor, rooibos has health benefits due to a high antioxidant level that some are saying is higher than green tea."

I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I didnt listen to some of the nay-sayers out there and decdided to see for myself what all the hype was about and if it really did was it was supposed to do. I tried not to get too excited because i have tried Trimspa and Zantrex before but had very slow results if any.Lipovarin started out ok as i got a little uneasy feeling for the first couple of days but than that went away. I really liked how i got energy from taking the pills in the morning before my workouts and again in the afternoon. I found myself drinking less and less coffee which also helped me save some pocket money! :) My dieting was good as i ate less carbs also. I lost over 4 lbs the first week and was super excited.The next week I felt like i was really sweating more during my workouts and that was surprising to me since i didnt increase anything i was doing in the gym. LIpovarin also seemed to curb my appetite and i didnt have the urge to snack during the day which also helped me since i was a big carb snacker at work. The second week I lost another 3 lbs which i was still very pleased about. I also started to notice a slight chang ein my waist area. It seemed to me that my jeans were fitting better too. My husband also noticed this as well.The 3rd week I lost another 3lbs and although i wanted to keep losing more weight each week i was very happy to maintain what i was doing. My workouts were going very well and i was following my diet very well at this point. The fourth week I slipped a little because of Thanksgiving and I ate more than i wanted to but you all know what happens when the family gets together and everything looks so GOOD to eat! Well i only lost one pound that week but i think it was all due to Turkey day.The 5th week (i was on my second bottle at this point) I really started to see some better increase in the weight loss as I lost 6lbs that week alone! I picked up the cardio a little in the gym because i was upset that i let myself go on thanksgiving and it really showed. Lipovarin was giving me good energy throughout the day and i couldnt be doing what i was doing without it. I actually looked forward to going to the gym and the best part was feeling energized on my way there. I used to dread going to the gym without and energy and just hoping a morning cup of coffee was going to get me going. The diet was back on track and i was eating a stedy flow of chicken salads, tuna, and chicken sandwiches and trying to stay away from late nights eating and drinking lots of fluids.The 6th week I dropped 5 lbs and there was a noticable difference in my body and all my friends and co-workers really started to notice as the compliments were flowing in. This is the best part of dieting and really makes you feel good when compliments are being thrown at you. At this point I have lost over 23 lbs and was well on my way to my goal of 40lbs lost. I was fearful of hitting a plateau and didnt want to do that so i tried a new diet plan which consisted of new foods and it seemed to spark my weight loss more! I added in a protein shake and that helped to increase my protein intake.The next week I lost another 5lbs and actually measured my waist to my surprise i had lost over 3 inches on my waist!! I was so excited to be able to fit into some of my older jeans. I tell you that the best feeling is to look into the mirror and just be able to stare and wonder who that new perons is standing in front of you. I was almost at my goal and was so crazy to get there. I was going to stop at nothing till i reached it. The following week I hit a personal best and lost 7lbs that week! I so focused in the gym and i looked forward to every workout. I added in an extra 30 min on the stair master after my normal hour of treadmill. This was actaully very easy to do as i was in good cardio shape now. I was almost at my goal and was getting very excited and i was going to reach my holiday goal of 40 lbs lost. The next week I only lost 2lbs but it was still positive so i was not complaining (upset but you know the deal). I was almost there but the holidays were right around the corner. I sucked it up and kept myself focused and mid-week i weighed in and had reached my 40lb lost goal! I couldnt believe myself and my hubby was soooo proud of me. At this point 3 of my friends are now on Lipovarin and 2 of my male co-workers so this stuff is great. Everyone should try Lipovarin and stay with it because you can get the same results i had and you will love it!!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,We tried this cup when my daughter was 9 months old. She just couldn't master drinking from this sippy cup or any other. We finally used the Nubi cup for a month and now she is 13 months old and does great with this cup. This is the only cup we use now.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work. I used it FREQUENTLY (at least twice daily) for the 5 months I pumped at work. It always worked wonderfully. I never had trouble with let-down or supply. Sometimes I filled both 8 oz. bottles in a 15-minute session! Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply, I can't imagine this pump not working great. I didn't have any problems with it the whole time I used it!"
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"This is the best nursing pillow on the market. I have also used both pillows and the Boppy. My baby is 7 months old and I still use My Brest Friend. Boppies and pillows do not give the same comfort and support because they do not secure around the waist as this one does. It stays in place and I do not have to re-situate everything each time the baby shifts positions as I have had to do with pillows and the Boppy. I have found that I do not have any upper back, neck or shoulder discomfort while nursing and I believe that is due to the stability of this pillow. I highly recommend taking this to the hospital to use right away. It is also useful to support the baby while bottle feeding. Spend the extra money, it is well worth it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This product is a great item for anyone who needs a protein/energy bar as part of the weight/muscle gain and workout program.They have about 300 calories and 21g of protein, as well as great amino acids. The taste of the 2 varieties I tried has been good, particularly the double fudge brownie. I would recommend using these bars in conjunction with something like cytogainer or even muscle milk, because these bars alone might not be sufficient for some people.My only complaint is they use high fructose corn syrup, but hey, nobody is perfect."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a great product for anyone who can't have a bowel movement. I'm not sure if I would call this a laxative. It definitely causes a bowel movement, but it's so gentle that it could probably be taken every night. It seems to work best if it's taken before bedtime. You only have to take one capsule. I've read that Cascara Sagrada is also safe for small children. However, anything stronger than 425 mgs might cause abdominal pain. Most people with irregular bowel movements usually suffer because of poor diets. It would be a good idea to make sure you are getting enough fiber in your diet by also taking a fiber supplement such as Fibercon or Metamucil if you are one of those people."
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"Apparently Walk-Fit Orthotics may come in different sizes, but they only come in one width. I wear EE shoes (way wider than most women!). I did not at first realize that the Walk Fits were too wide, but I did notice that my feet felt like they were tilting to the outside. I attributed the tilt to the ""Breaking-In Phase."" Of course, the only thing that broke was my alignment (several costly trips to the chiropractor have NOT remediated the situation).When I finally took a closer look (unfortunately, it was a few week later), I realized that the orthotics were actually tilted inside my shoe because they were slightly wider than my shoe. I had a friend with a C width shoe try them on; well, she never acutally got to try them on because they did not even begin to fit inside her shoe. Since the average woman's shoe width is B, most women cannot begin to wear the Walk-fit. Now, they can send it right back for a full refund - minus shipping and handling of course (probably a great money-maker for the company right there).I have heard comments about the difficulty of trying to return products to Walk-Fit. They are true! Maybe a few lucky souls get their money back, but the company just won't do it - they have several reasons why they don't have to. I consider the company to engage in false advertising - the product is not for women, but the infomercials do not say that. I'm going to contact my State's Attorney's Office to report fraudulent practices. I suggest all other unhappy consumers do the same."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"No batteries or outlet needed here! The Medela Harmony manual breastpump is great, I love it. It is so easy to use, has a dual phase, less parts to clean, lightweight so you can throw it in the diaper bag and pump whenever needed, and has wonderful suction power. Great price at $30 (got mine on sale). Medela is a reputable comany which also puts my mind at ease if something were to break and I know it is the best quality. This model is for occasional pumping only. For frequent pumping, you need to get a Medela Pump In Style (the Advanced model has the dual phase, the original does not)."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I have about $100 worth of Avent products that did not seem to work for my daughter. My cousin told me about Dr. Brown that she uses with her son (8 days younger then my daughter) and they are the best bottles! They are definitly worth the money. They are not as difficult to clean as they look, (Which is why I originally went with a different bottle!) Also, something I wish someone would have told me before I had my daughter, find a bottle your baby likes before buying everything compatible with those bottles. It was a very expensive mistake for us!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I have a lot of trouble sleeping, and do better when I have some sort of white noise going on in the background. This machine is incredibly inexpensive, and you don't have to go broke supplying batteries for it, because it comes with its own AC plug.Another great feature is the timer. You can set it for 15, 30 or 60 minutes. And of course, there is a volume control. I also like the design. It is compact, but stable, and not likely to get knocked over very easily. It could be placed on an unstable surface like the carpet, or, in my case, a pile of books on my nightstand.I don't like the heartbeat sound, but I've fallen asleep quite well to all of the other sounds. My favorite is the ""Rain"" sound - very consistent and soothing.My only complaint is the sound quality. I would rate it as average - I've heard better, and I've heard worse. The sounds are repetitive, with only about a minute long cycle.And my reason for not giving it five stars is that when you turn the sound up past a certain level (not even to the halfway point on the volume control), there is a feedback buzz. Lucky for me, there is room on my nightstand right next to my bed, so I can hear it on the lower levels. But for someone who has to place it on another spot in the room, it could be annoying."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,This pillow is so much better than the Boppy for nursing. It us a great platform on which to feed the baby! I hate when the cover is dirty and I have to use the Boppy!
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"My friend recommended these to me when I began feeding my son solids (cheerios and other snacks). The idea is cute, but it just wasnt comfortable for me. My son figured out how to take the lid off as well as taking half of the food out at once, so it made lots of mess. Its also not comfortable to have in your diaper bag. I tried using the link rings and attach it to his stroller but the food tends to spill out. Overall it was just a waste of money, switched back to ziplock bags and its been almost a year and found nothing that can beat the ziplocks."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Finally a gluten-free nutrition bar that satisfies and tastes rich and chocolatey. I eat it for lunch on a busy day in between seeing patients and it keeps me going all afternoon. It's like a rich chewy brownie except I know it's good for me. This so far is my favorite nutrition bar made by anyone and my favorite flavor for this company. I also recommend the peanut butter one.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"Everyone told me that these were ""the"" bottles. So, we bought newborn as well as the 9 and 11 oz sets. Here were the problems with these bottles/nipples:1. Nipples are too long and too tough...the baby would almost gag on the nipple when feeding and would fall asleep quickly because she was having to work too hard.2. The bottles had a vacuum effect - every few minutes I would have to unscrew the cap and screw it back on to stop the vacuum effect, which would stop the milk flow from the nipple. Every time I had to re-screw on the cap, milk would start leaking. I followed the directions exactly and did not over tighten the cap, but still the problem persisted.3. The nipple flow was too slow or too fast. My newborn couldn't get anything from the newborn nipples and would fall asleep from exhaustion. We then went with the next size up (faster) and that worked. Once she outgrew that speed, and needed the level 2 and 3, they were too fast. There was no inbetween.4. The nipple flow rates work differently on each sized bottle. I don't know what causes this, but she was able to eat with the 2 flow nipple on the 4 ounce bottles, but when she needed more food, and we tried the 2 flow nipple on the 9 ounce bottle, the 2 nipple flowed too slowly.Overall, my experience with these bottles was exasperating. I felt like I was a ""sucker"" for falling for the latest fad. I then went to the store and bought one of every bottle out there. She went for the Playtex Nurser with the latex nipple (they are softer and more flexible) and has loved it ever since. Haven't had any problems what-so-ever and finally feeding is a happy experience.One thing I can say is that the Avent bottles with the wide neck are perfect for mixing formula in. We actually mix the formula in the Avents with a hand mixer and then pour the formula into the Playtex. Also, we can use the Avent bottles with the sippy cup conversion pieces, so the money we spent on the bottles isn't a total loss. We now have more sippy cups than we could ever possibly want or use!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"If I had not been given a ton of Avent bottles, I would have chosen some other system. The leaking is terrible!!! You have to buy the disks separately, you should get them for free because they are absolutely essential. The only way to mix formula in the bottle or transport liquid is to use the disks in the ring, then switch to the nipple when you are ready to feed. The only reason I give it a two is because I do like that you can pump directly into the bottle with the ISIS breast pump. And, I like the sippy cups."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,3.0,"Now, maybe it was poor judgement on my behalf to buy bulk potato chips online, but I like Pringles. These (pizza flavor) arrived, and I noticed, by ear, some damage, but I didn't think it would be that great, so I opened it up anyway.The first can had minimal breakage, and I thought, alright, this is fine. I just oepened can number two now though, and I see shards of Pringles up to about the halfway point of the can.So yes, lots of these chips were cracked beyond recognition during shipping, which isn't the best way to enjoy a Pringle. Amazon definitely needs to package this item better."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I've always thought this water had a funny taste to it. Kind of like it was filtered or something, even though this may indeed be how ""pure"" water is supposed to be. It's difficult to describe the taste of water though.Anyway, I'm sticking with Poland Springs sparkling flavored waters. I like the carbonation, and the slight natural flavors like lime and rasberry. It's also cheaper than this water."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I breastfed my son for 15 months and I am now breastfeeding my second child. I work full time and so I MUST have a reliable and easy to use pump. I am also a breastmilk donor and donate milk to a mother's milk bank for premature babies. So,in addition to feeding my own child I must have enough supply to donate as well.I used the Medela Pump in Style Advanced the whole time that I was nursing my son. (So trust me after 15 months I know all of its pros and cons) The Medela PIS advanced has a very large bag and is very heavy once you get it packed up with all of your milk and supplies for pumping. I am also a petite female and the strap on the bag for the Medela PIS is so large and long that it was forever falling off of my shoulder while trying to walk to the parking garage. The personal fit horns for the Medela PIS are great except there is a ridge inside that can rub your nipples raw. I loved my Medela PIS at first but towards the end really started to dislike it. I also noticed that the longer I used it, the Medela PIS, the more my supply diminished. I could pump for 20 minutes and then could sit there and hand express 2 to 3 more ounces from each side with just my bare hands.So this time I decided to try something different. The Avent Isis IQ Duo.THIS PUMP IS WONDERFUL! A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!The ability to select your own suction level and speed is great. (You definately don't have that same option with the Medela PIS) I get 10-12 ounces in 10 minutes versus the 8 I got in the same amount of time with my Medela. I think The Avent duo pump is extremely quiet. I believe it is less noticeable than the PIS ever was. The microfiber bag is perfect and is comfortable to carry, even for a very petite female like me. I believe the set up for this pump is no more complicated than setting up the PIS by Medela.Overall I would have to say that I LOVE this pump. It is comfortable, quiet, efficient and worth every penny. I only wish it had been around when I breastfed my son for 15 months!UPDATE!!!After reading some of the other reviews I wanted to add a few other things:1. This pump is no more top heavy than the Medela pump in style. The tubing for my Medela was no more flexible than the tubing on the Avent Isis IQ duo. I cannot tell you how many times the tubing for my Medela Pump in style tipped the bottles over spilling my precious breastmilk everywhere.2. The Avent VIA bases are Wonderful for storing your breastmilk. They work much better than the bags because they do not leak. As far as not having stabilizers to hold the via bases; the lids work perfectly as a base for the via bottles. The bottoms of the via bases fit in the tops of the via lids.3. Unless you have used a pump for at least six months or more I don't think you truly realize all of its pros and cons. As I said, at first I loved my Medela Pump in Style Advanced. Now I couldn't bear to be without the Avent Duo."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"I give it one star for the engergy boost. That was the only benefit for me. I went to the gym, and yet my weight stayed the same. I was very excited when I ordered it, but after a few weeks I gave up. I was extrememly disappointed. I am convinced that diet pills are a joke. Please, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!The only way I lost weight was by eating small portions, every few hours, and walking at lunch. I lost 12 lbs in two months, and I continue to lose weight by watching my portions and working out, my total weight loss is 18 lbs."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,I have been exercising like a lunatic and barely saw any results. A woman at my health club said to try this weight loss system she found on Amazon so I decided to give it a try.I really don't like to write reviews about stuff because I feel everyone has thier own opinion and should be kept to themselves to share only with who they care to. But when I tried these products WOW I had to tell the world...I'm now the incredible shrinking woman. My body is getting back to the weight I was at before having my son. I really hope this review helps anyone out there that needs that little extra something to help them achieve thier weight loss goals.

A 6 pack should be about $60, in my opinion, not $80."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"Our little one has grown out of the gas, and we thought we'd give these a go, after using the Playtex nurser system for her (she's mainly breastfed, but I'm going back to work soon). These bottles gave her more gas than the Playtex nurser collapsible liners, although I guess it depends upon how your baby feeds. Ours gets right down to business, and protests strongly if you take her off to burp her until she reaches a certain level of fullness, so it's important that the bottles do not generate gas. Dr Brown's bottles do seem to generate gas, and they are fiddly to clean. We won't be using these again. On the plus-side, you can pump straight from a Medela pump into the bottles, which is handy, and means slightly less waste, I suppose."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I had tried playtex disposable bottles and was highly disappointed. The liners kept filling up with air once I put the cap on the bottle or I had spills.But Dr. Browns have saved the day. I love the way these bottles look, perform and how my son passes his gas easily. Great purchase, I loaded up on nipples the other day for when he needs a different flow. Worth every moment cleaning and sterilzing! I rather have a happy baby then a fussy baby."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,I followed the instructions well but do not show the result as I expected from their advertisements. It is a little disappointed and I felt ripped off because these products are expensive. And there were SO MANY colorful capsules to ingesting in my body with almost little or no results ...I would suggest anyone interested to think twice before purchasing these products.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"I give this 3 stars because it is too pricey at $28.80 pack of 12, even with the promotional discount. I can get this for $1.52 a pack, almost $1.00 less than the Amazon price. Better yet, now it is on sale for $1.28 a pack. I won't buy this here. It is worth a trip to the store."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Just spent the last day and a half in the restroom. Can't believe they advertise this as 'gentle'. Pay close attention to active ingredient (I wish I had). Magnesium in high dosages will give you the runs, nothing more. If you want to have the runs, buy this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I decided to try this out. I'm a 100% skeptic. I never resort to these so-called natural remedies. I believe the vast majority of them are simply bogus, and some even dangerous.The above having been said, I WILL be using this product again. Not because I believe that it has 'cleansed' me, but simply because -- ever since the first day -- I have been feeling extremely well. Not well as in strung out on caffeine well, but well as in healthy well. I highly recommend this to anyone who constantly feels fatigued, as did I."

Also, some sites that offer genuine Argentinean brands, I think I'll try them next."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I bought these bottles and loved the shape. My newborn daughter sucked too hard for these stage one nipples. It took her 45 minutes to eat 2 ounces. As a result, she sucked in a lot of air and had gas pains. She was not burping during or afer feeding anymore.The stageb twos were too fast for her. I switched to Dr. Brown's stage ones and couldn't be happier!"

I only uses them when I really crave a ciggarette, and I'm detemine to really quit this time.UPDATE - It's April, 2008, and I'm still commited to Commit. At least I'm not destroying my lungs with smoke anymore. Will try to quit Commit by the end of the month. Good luck!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I first bought the Cookies N' Cream version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it. However, the taste of Cookies n' Cream isn't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate.On a side note; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles, or give them an complexion or even make you bigger. It all depends on the type of workout you have. You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym, however, muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that's what protiens do. They repair damaged muscles and strengthen them, and at the same time make them bigger."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have been taking the green tea supplement for 4 weeks, twice the dose that the bottle recommends, walking 20 minutes daily and have lost 21 lbs. without any change in my diet. (I still enjoy the occasional cheeseburger and fries). I have yet to found another supplement that yielded that kind of result. I don't know if the weight loss was due to the walking or the green tea, or the combination, but I do suggest trying this routine. Swanson Vitamins is the most inexpensive source I have found (with fast mail delivery) and walking is really kind of addictive. I had a hard time at first going out to walk, but wanted to see if the plan would work and I can easily say, it did. Good luck to you! One thing I can say with certainty, is that the supplements I have purchased from Swanson have been cheaper than most and still effective."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I liked this tea. I average a cup a day, and I always use teabags instead of the loose stuff for the convenience factor. Speaking of which, that is my sole complaint about this tea. The bag didn't have a string, which is what I use to drain the last few drops of water from the teabag.This is minor, I realize. But my tea-drinking is a ritual event. The boiling of the water, the whistling of the kettle, the dunking of the teabag, and finally the squeezing and disposal of the teabag.Bottom line, though, the tea was yummy."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the ""single malt and cigars"" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Like the famously smoky Lapsang Souchong, Oolong tea comes from mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits, and where tea has been grown at least since the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279).In terms of production, Oolong tea takes a middle position between the fully fermented black teas (Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon, Kenya, Lapsang Souchong, etc.) and the unfermented green teas (Sencha, Maccha, Gyokuro, Hougicha/Hojicha, Gunpowder Green), in that it is part-fermented or ""brown"" tea. Its long, dark leaves' fermentation is stopped when they are about 30% red and 70% green, after which they are rubbed to promote their aroma and texture and then dried over charcoal.Ti Quan (Kuan) Yin Oolong takes its name from the Goddess of Mercy (Quan Yin), whose statues can often be found in front of Buddhist temples. Quan Yin is a bodhisattva, i.e. a person who has earned the right to leave this world of misery and enter nirvana, but who has volunteered to stay on earth and assist others in their quest for enlightenment. Legend has it that in a village whose temple was adorned by an iron (""ti"") statue of the goddess, one night Quan Yin appeared in a local farmer's dream and guided him to a cave behind the temple. There, she told him, he would find a treasure he was to tend and share with others. The treasure he did find when he went to the cave the very next morning turned out to be a small tea plant, which he took home and nursed. When it had grown to its full size, its leaves produced this particularly aromatic tea with the delicate fragrance of fruits and spices and a rich, golden color. As he had been bidden by the goddess, the farmer shared it with his neighbors, and he also dedicated it to Quan Yin in grateful appreciation of her gift.Goddess of Mercy Oolong makes for a great refreshment at any time of day and also goes well with meals. It can be enjoyed with or without milk (or cream), and its leaves will even yield a second cup when re-infused."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"My husband loves Tangerine Orange Zinger tea, but it is hard to find. I used to buy 2 to 4 boxes a week from a local grocery, but they decided not to carry it, and did not respond to my request to bring it back. Other local stores charge $1.50 more per box, so I decided to look elsewhere.I found several places on the web that sell this tea, but I would have had to buy 24 boxes to get the price I wanted, AND pay shipping charges. In the end Amazon offered the lowest price ($2.17/box), and no shipping cost when I bought $25+ worth of product. That was only 12 boxes which may seem like a lot, but the tea is cellophane sealed, and won't go bad. If you drink lots of tea buying from Amazon will likely be your best value."

However, when it comes to diapers and especially formula it seems that they're shipping the product from Neptune. The deal is definitely worth it and also for convenience it's a great buy BUT please try to stock up on formula/diapers before you order otherwise you'll end up going to the store for these items."

I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar.Water is so good for us, but so boring. If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water.This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water). Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect.My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years. A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug. I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee. With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy.The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows:Purified waterNatural flavorsCaramel colorPotassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness)Citric acidXantham gumSucralose (splenda brand)Acesulfame potassiumNutrition Facts label reads as follows:Serving Size"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I got these for my husband to try something different than just regular coffee. He really liked it, though he added a hint of cinnamon to his froth. He tried both the demi-tasse size (one cup) and the full cup size (two cups) and found a very small difference between the two. Using two pods made it just a little better, but not enough to justify using up two pods for one cup of coffee, vs. just one pod on the two cup selection. It is frothy and tastes good."

health personal care,health care,first aid,2.0,"My experience appears to be different than that of most other reviewers. While Bite Blocker may keep the bugs at bay, it smells rancid and leaves a lingering taste in one's mouth for hours. Two of us in our home used the product and had similar results. Our experience with Cutter Advanced with picaridin is much better. No smell, no taste and it keeps the bugs off."

I prefer to eat them raw although my best friend, who referred me to them, puts them in her cereal in the morning.I used to buy these 8 oz. bags in my local health food store--for $10.99 each. The deal here on Amazon is far better. I'm only 23, so I can't vouch for the whole life-enriching, ultra-vitality claims, but I can say that I'd rather eat these tasty Tibetan berries than swallow a pill that never seems to do anything."

When I said No kitty, she went crazy, climbed me like a tree, jumped in my hair and started trying to claw my eyes out. Luckily I was still able to see well enough through all the blood oozing down my face to stagger to the refrigerator, yank out the milk, and throw the container down hard enough to knock off the top. Milk gurgled all over the floor and Kitty forgot all about me! I slipped on the way to the bathroom and the sight of all that blood and milk swirling around me was really quite striking. I'll have to order some more one day."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I like spice, so it's great for me, but if you are using it for meat and are in the habit of marinading and seasoning the meat before preparing it, tone down your own spices, this spicy peanut bake is spicy enough on its own and tangy and doesn't require additional seasonings. So be careful."

First of all, its made in Winston-Salem North Carolina and served in all the diners here in the Carolinas like ketchup, which it complements very well, but doesn't add any heat too.Rates out at about 500 Scoville units, Texas Pete can only be described as ""hot sauce flavored thinned-out tomato sauce.""

I was desparate for chocolate/sweets. This has evaperated cane sugar - but nothing else bad, and I love them.It only gets a four because the teenager in my house thought they tasted odd, but then she can have normal sweets.Also when looking for dairyfree and refined sugar free chocolates, I noticed all the other stuff has a sweetener called maltitol in it - which is corn based! Corn is on my forbidden list. This product is my savior....but wondering about the price, when I buy a bag of this is the store, it is not that much. the 30$ price must be for an entire case of the mix, they should say how many bags are in these cases."

When we don't want it out, it's small size makes it easy to put in a closet. Even better, we take it to restaurants with us and our daughter is secure and in a clean seat. This new one has some toys on top that are great for occupying her while we get her food ready. It comes with an on/off switch so you're not stuck hearing annoying sounds. The seat is great even if you don't want the toys - you just remove them and toss them or hide them. It's also much less expensive then traditional highchairs."

I think you agree with me Thai Pavilion is head and shoulders above the competition. I found this to be true with all their flavors."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My IBS symptoms (mixed) reemerged horribly after having to discontinue a serotonin-based antidepressant due to a rash. I had weeks of incredibly painful symptoms and nothing worked, not even medication from the doctor. I was taking Fibercon caps which did no good. In desperation I tried a low dose of acacia powder and also later, one peppermint capsule a day. A complete turnaround occurred in just a few days, also helped by suggestions on the helpforibs.com website, and I have been doing well ever since. Based on the timeframe,it appears the acacia powder was the most significant agent. I am a complete skeptic so I can tell you this was not a placebo effect. I didn't think it would work and when it did, I was surprised and so grateful."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I can see why people claim this vitamin tastes good. Compared to other liquid vitamins on the market, it's a huge improvement! I like this vitamin, but they add ginseng, which is a stimulant. When I first started taking it, I didn't feel the need to have extra caffeine throughout the day, but then I couldn't get to sleep at night! My head was buzzing from the ginseng long into the night. I've been taking the red versionSource Of Life Red Mixed Berry 30 oz Liquidconsistently for a while now and I find that the over-stimulating effect of the ginseng wears off after about a week.The red version tastes better!"

My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly.

I was getting tight, knotted muscles in my back and shoulders that were restricting my movement and dully hurt. I'm single, though, so had no good way to get them out. I was looking for something to help when I came across these reviews and decided to buy a Theracane for myself. Oh, is it wonderful!It's very easy to use and easily got out all the knots in my muscles. Right after it was delivered, I spent about 30 minutes gently working the knots out of my shoulders and back while I watched TV. That felt so wonderful, so I worked the last knots out of my shoulders a little bit later that day. It felt so good to be free of stiffness and pain! I felt like I was fifteen again. I highly recommend this product."

After a few doses of pills my baby became very gassy and uncomfortable. I waited a few more day and tried again, gassy again... so I'm not taking them anymore. I'm sure this product probably works very well for other moms, I think my situation was just unique.

Goes great with Trader Joes hot chocolate powder too"

From now on I'll be buying Rosenberger's."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,4.0,"I give this Tuscan Milk four stars simply because I found the consistency a little too ""milk-like"" for my tastes.

grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,5.0,"Once I began this extraordinary milk, I could not put it down. ""Tuscan Whole Milk"" is so much more than a gripping suspense thriller. Tuscan takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for the Holy Grail of Milk- a Grail totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. A Grail of Milk! With its impeccable whiteness, Tuscan introduces us to aspects and interpretations of milk and cream that I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly, leaving the plastic carton, and time and time again, going online to research Tuscan's milking process - only to find a new world of dairy possibilities opening up for me. And my quest for milk and the answers to questions that the dairy product poses, paralleled, in a sense, the quest of the gallon of milk's main characteristics. What a trip! What a cow!A violent murder is committed in Tuscany. The region's chief dairy farmer, who is also the head of a remarkable secret milk society that has existed since the death of Christ's cow, is found dead and gruesomely positioned on the floor near a milk bucket. In the minutes before he died, this very complex man was able to leave clues for his daughter to follow.

My neighbour suddenly pulls out a Gaterade and his ipod. ""Allah Akbar"" he shouts out and in annoyance I turn to him to tell him to shut the hell up, accidentally knocking my milk jug over his lap just as a small explosion was beginning to emit from his groinal area.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,:
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"I was highly skeptical, but I bought this stuff because I've liked other Taste of Thai products that I've bought in the store. I wasn't sure it would translate into a microwave product though -- but it does.The noodles cook up really nicely, although it's important to stir well between the two cooking phases. The sauce is very flavorful, and thickens nicely as it cools. It's a bit spicy, but I like that. I wouldn't think that it would be too spicy for many people, but if you REALLY dislike spicy food, this might not be for you (then again, if that were the case, you probably wouldn't even be considering this product).The only downside of this product is that it's fairly small. The container is huge, but that's just to accomodate the noodles before they cook. Once cooked, the noodles take up much less space. The portion is decent for a lunch, but you may want to cook up two of these for dinner.This stuff is addictive like Asian crack -- I just ordered 3 more cases!"

Interestingly, it has dramatically helped my bone-on-bone knee pain, since when my back is in better alignment my knees don't hurt as much. I rarely get back aches but when I have ""overdone"" my bending, etc., activities, this takes the discomfort away immediately. Definitely a keeper."

It came completely assembled, ready to use out of the box. After all toys, gadgets, what have you that we've had to assemble we really appreciated this aspect. I find the chair completely sturdy and I can fold it up and unfold it with one hand while holding my son. It is absolutely perfect for small kitchens like ours, we fold and unfold it for every single meal. There are also hidden wheels at the bottom that make it very easy to move once it is unfolded. The seat wipes clean easily, but like the prior poster I have a noticed one very small stain on the seat, I am assuming from carrots or sweet potatoes.I absolutely rave about this chair to all I meet. We love it!"

I've tried the gum, the patch, the cold turkey syndrome...everything. Until, I came across QuitKey. I figured...it's just another tool, but at this rate, I'll try anything. So, I bought it and I got the hang of it after a few days. It's a great tool since it allows you to tell it how much you are smoking and then it will tell you when to smoke and when not to smoke. It's relative to the Pavlovs Dog's Theory. Everytime you hear the chime go off in the program you are supposed to smoke. After about 34 days, the chime never goes off again and you don't think twice about smoking. It's a great tool since the chime isn't like any other chime out there. I would recommend this product to anyone who has been trying to quit smoking forever just like I have been. Give it a shot!"

They came from Amazon and not a third party seller. This was my first time ordering from Amazon and was disappointed in this item only! Unfortunately, they were extremely stale. I looked at the expiration date on the product and it was fine, however, I think these items were frozen and thawed out or they sat in a very warm area of a warehouse and dried out beyond tastefullness! I had a few other people who always eat these try them and they said they were not good AT ALL! I will not order food type items from you again, but will definitely keep shopping at Amazon.com. It's great otherwise! Keep up the good work on your prices, items and service. I would take a look at your food storage though."

I have one on race morning with about 12 ozs of milk. I try to finish it about 45 mins to an hour before the race. With about 15 mins to go I'll have 10-15 ozs of sports drink. I don't drink anything during the race. This has worked flawlessly for anything up to 10k."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"The only thing good I can say about this product is that it tastes good. That is true of the entire Slimfast line of products. They all taste good. But due to the high sugar content they are not weight loss products as the name of the product and company advertising suggests. The Optima line of Slimfast products reduces, but does not eliminate the volume of sugar. This is really stupid on the part of the Slimfast Company. They could have eliminated sugar all together and replaced it with Splenda. Then they would have actually had a weight loss product. But due to the low cost of sugar and the fact that most people prefer the taste of sugar, they chose to ""reduce"" the sugar content. The smart consumer will not buy this product, unless you have no need for weight loss, and don't mind buying a good tasting product from a company that misleads the public in their advertising.Since the main ingredient in all Slimfast products is sugar, their products have absolutely no weight-reducing characteristic. I tried the Slimfast products and program myself, so I know from my own experience that it does not work!The US Department of Agriculture did many studies to result in their well know ""food guide pyramid."" It states that ""sweets should be used sparingly.""

You can taste apples and cinnamon in each bite and every once in awhile you'll get a big crunchy chunk of walnut. So good!

I find other brands can be too agressive to swallow, as some are too large, uncoated, and seem to have sharp edges on them (they are simple and crudely made); whereas, these Oat Bran tablets exhibit quality in every pill. Not all brands are the same. Solgar's Oat Bran tablets appear to be a product made with pride and to perfection. They are neither too large nor difficult to swallow. These are two important qualities I search for, which facilitate my taking my daily vitamins. With such care taken in creating this product, I can only conclude that the end product is of equal excellence."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"OK, this is going to be a tough one. O'My O Clitoral Stimulating Gel is a water-based (glycerin) gel that is designed to stimulate the clitoris by using menthol to produce a tingling sensation, and as such a heightened sensitivity. The idea is that you will apply it in drips, until you reach the desired level of tingle.My first problem with this stuff is that it works best for solo play. Your lover will be hard-pressed to know how much to apply unless you talk him through it, which is somewhat less than sensuous. My second problem is that if you use too much of this stuff, it will produce an unpleasant burning sensation, rather than an erotic tingling one, and when used by a couple, that's too likely.Some women seem to swear by this stuff, whereas others swear *at* it. Similarly some men have complained about burning, whereas others have never felt any such thing. This suggests that results will be somewhat individualistic. So, you'll need to buy some to experiment with, and it's not cheap. On the up side, the fact that it is water-based which means that it will not interfere with condoms.Overall, I was not impressed with this stuff. At first I found the sensation quite stimulating, but before too long it began to just burn. So, for me it didn't work, whereas for the next woman it will. Let the buyer beware!(Review of O' My All-Natural O' Clitoral Stimulating Gel)"

I had never tried whole wheat pasta before, so I didn't know what was ""good.""It's not bad. Cooks well. Has a bit of a nutty flavor, but this doesn't overwhelm the spaghetti sauce. If the kids aren't ready for brown pasta, it can be mixed with normal angel hair pasta--just beware that whole wheat takes longer to cook, so you will have to prepare both pastas separately.Also, there are 12 boxes in the package--so if you don't know if you are going to like you may want to buy an individual box at the store first!"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"First let me say that I have tried many different bottles.When my first child was born a few years ago, I used Advent bottles. I didn't like the straight shape, although cleaning was easier and I loved the wide neck. Unfortunately if you don't screw the top on just right on those things - whammo - formula/breast milk/juice all over you and your close neighbors! (I don't even want to mention what this can mean when you are sitting on an airplane). And let me just say that I could never quite figure out when this was going to happen. There was absolutlely NO indication that the top was not on correctly. It looked right. It felt right. After being completely disgusted with the unpredictability of those, I switched to a bent-necked J&J; bottle that is no longer being made. I liked those, but hated cleaning the narrow bottle - it never seemed to GET clean.With my next child, I chose the playtex ventaire natural shape. There are several things I love about them:1. Wide bottles are a MUST for ease of cleaning. You don't even need a special brush which is nice when you are travelling/camping/backpacking2. I agree with some other reviewers that having all those separate pieces actually makes cleaning easier and as long as you have a little dishwasher cage to collect them all it's not a big deal.3. The crook-neck design is great for the carseat/stroller/whatever.What I hate about these bottles:1. What's with the cover? Can anyone else get them to stay on? I simply abandoned them completely after wrestling with them for a few weeks with no luck2. They do leak sometimes. It has only happened a few times but when it does - Yikes! Another reviewer mentioned a slow leak that happens over time in your car/diaper bag and that has definitely happened to me. Perhaps only 10 times in the year and a half I've been using them, but STILL annoying. and MESSY and what happens when you only brought that one bottle and there it has spilled all over the floor of your car?3. After about 11 months of use, all of the bottles started cracking in the dishwasher and they all had to be thrown away and replaced. Which come to think of it could have coincided with the slow leak issue...Now we just put the bottles on the upper rack (was this in the instructions to begin with?) and haven't had a problem yet (been about 6 months).4. My son bites through the nipples and I have trouble finding replacements. Babies R Us is the only store around that carries the nipples (not Target, not the Grocery store) and then playtex has so many designs, it's tough to figure out which one you really need. Made all the more challenging by screaming baby and impatient 5 year old. Right now I am frantically searching the internet for suppliers as BabiesRus is out of stock and I only have 4 functioning nipples.With all of that said...I really love the concept and wish they would solve their quality and availibility issues."

Sometimes you want something soft and soothing but not herbal, that almost tastes like juicy water and this really takes the punch.I love it with a bit of sugar, and it gets even better when cooled or made with ice. For those watching calories, sugar can be omitted and this tea can be drunk in gallons to refresh and tranquilize. I can forget all about store bought iced teas and all the soda in the world when presented with this, as it is truly a tea I can see myself buying for the rest of my life. It's gentler than black tea, healthier and 100% natural with less caffeine than coffee and that flowery aroma of summer bouquets caught in a tiny tea bag is a marvel to behold.- Kasia S."

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I was very skeptical about this product at first. Me? Put water up my nose....ON PURPOSE? How stupid do you think I am?However, constant sneezing and irritation due to a dusty work environment eventually made me give in and try this thing out.It's absolutely amazing! The first few times are very strange. The feeling you get when using it for the first time is similar to snorting water up your nose while swimming (not very pleasent) and your nose will most likely run for a day or two afterwards, so keep some tissues on hand.If you use it on a regular basis though, you'll really be pleased with the results. I was sneezing at least 15 times a day and now I only sneeze 1-3 times and only at the end of the day after I've been inhaling dust at work for 9 hours. I no longer have to deal with a stuffed up nose and the constant nosebleeds I was getting from rubbing at it so much to ease the irritation.The one thing I have to warn you about with this item is NOT to use tap water. I tried using tap water at first and it felt like someone lit fire to my nose hairs. To remedy this, I bought some cheap distilled water and it worked like a charm. Also, please follow the instructions which say to use lukewarm water and breathe with your mouth. If you follow the simple instructions you'll become a neti pro in no time.So if you have allergies and you're tired of shoveling benadryl down your throat every day, I'd really give this a try. You might just be pleasently suprised."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,1.0,The chips are so-so. For me a package when opened must pass the smell test - these didn't. When ordering a case (12 bags) I assumed they would be shipped in a factory packed box. Not so. They were repackaged by Amazon in a box designed for ten bags. The case consisted of 12 bags. No problem for the packer as he just squeezed in the two extra bags. You can imagine what that does to potato chips. I now have 6 bags of whole chips and 6 bags of chip pieces which can be eaten with a spoon.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love drinking dietary supplements, my body feels more refreshed and exhilarated the moment they go down. When I take vitamins they often upset my stomach and I can feel them dissolving slowly while churning my stomach acids making me feel nauseous. I discovered Ola Loa products while shopping at my local Whole Food on a rainy Saturday. The healthy looking oceanic packaging caught my eye and the list of minerals and elements raised my curiosity. The flavor is Tropical, and it tastes very strange, not the sort of tropical fruity taste one would imagine, but it does taste more like the picture on the box. To me it tastes like the ocean, slightly salty and fizzy! I don't mind the flavor at all since these make me feel so great after I drink them. Ola Loa has no sugars and artificial ingredients, I don't want to drink vitamins that are spiked with fake things so the taste doesn't bother me. I mix it really well with a small glass of cool water and the effervescent fizz feels really nice when drank right away.Few days ago I had an upset stomach due to something I ate, after taking Imodium, Rolaids and Alka Seltzer with mixed results, I took a packed of Ola Loa Orange powder, which has the same ingredients as the Tropical, and dissolved it. Relief surged upon me instantly, and my stomach woes went away. I felt relieved and happy that this did the trick, as I used to have a sensitive stomach in childhood, but I am not used to problems of any sorts now. The unpleasant feeling did not come back, I have doubt it was the Ola Loa powder that did the trick.This is a great way to take your daily vitamins and some other exotic things such as CQ10, Chromium, Iodide, Boron, and amino acids N- Acetyl cysteine, L-Arginine, L-Lysine, L-Glycine, TMG-Betaine, L-Glumine and herbs Bromelain and Pineapple Bioflavinoids.In the past I had great results taking drinkable vitamins and I now see this might be the way to go for the future. I recommend other flavors of Ola Loa such as the Orange which I enjoy as well. The packets can be comfortably taken on any traveling expediting as well as to the office and anywhere else my feet guide me that day. Recommended dose is 1-3 packets daily, but I find it that even one packet makes me feel great, and sometimes I don't bother to take more than that.- Kasia S."

But if you realize how good for you they are and that they are made with real, natural ingredients then hopefully they will satisfy.

In addition, you're getting only 32 calories and 100% of your daily required folic acid in one serving. Because you need only take one small scoop a day, one cannister lasts a few months.

And what I like about this is that they come in varieties (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc.), so I won't be eating the same thing every time, which is also good. If you're in a rush in the morning and want something to grab and go within a 15 minute period, I recommend this to you. Also you don't have to waiste your dishes, because they come in their own plastic bowls.My only problem is that they are so small, and after about 10 spoon fulls, it's all gone. Sometimes I'm still hungry after eating one packet (and I'm skinny too).True this contains Trans Fats, what breakfast item that kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them? Not very many items. Maybe eggs, and whatnot. Also if your kids are somewhat active in somekind of fitness activities, those ""deadly trans fats"" should be worked off by the end of the day. And using fat free milk with the cerial would make the situation better also."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,Probably the worst meal replacement/supplementI've ever tasted. Huge after-taste and don'tforget NON-RETURNABLE - even after one bar.Not only do they test terrible but researchis now showing that high peanut content foodscause skin problems.My skin cleared up overnight after eliminatingall peanut based products from my diet.Look for a bar that offers digestive enzymesand all the right kind of protein your body needs.We live and learn
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"After reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar, and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby. We tried and used both bottles with our boy. The real deal between the two is the nipple. The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles. When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles. He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple. We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem. As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents. Why did we switch? Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS! There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles. Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well. However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do. For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other. Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with. Only 4 stars because of the cleaning issues."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,1.0,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon. I wish I had read the reviews before I tossed $14 down the commode. These are the most terrible tasing things I have ever put into my mouth. The texture is gritty, there is no taste except excessive salt. How can cheese, which I LOVE, be made to taste this bad? The only thing good about them is the smell. They smell like butter but taste like %@&#. One handful and the rest were flushed. I will definitely check the reviews before buying any more food products on line."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I am a diet bar junkie, my favorite ones are the ones that taste great but leave you full, rather than yearning for another snack 20 minutes later. These ones are quite small (about a 1/3 of a Luna bar) with 120 calories, a gooey caramel filling which is quite chewy, and a chocolate like outer shell. They are quite yummy but just don't taste ""real"" --not worth the 120 calories and they totally don't fill you up, and usually i reach for another snack soon after. If you have 120 calories to waste, just go for some very satisfying chocolate, or a few nuts."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"I was shopping last week in our local health food store and my daughter, sitting in the shopping cart, almost fell out to grab all available bags of these pretzels (she's 3). On the way home, she ate almost an entire bag and then for the next three days, all I heard at meal time was ""I want my pretzels!"" She's down to 0.25 bag per day now! Ditto about the taste (see previous reviewer)!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,5.0,"I was just sent four of the Sahale nut mixes. I really enjoyed the Ksar blend. I like the use of ingredients, it's fun to see what tastes good together that you wouldn't normally eat. I have one more to try, but I think this one is my favorite. Very good!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"For starters, I have never once heard of a ""tattoo pen"". That in itself scares the hell out of me. Secondly, everything about this is simply wrong, not to mention dangerous. Things like this continue to give hack and slash ""artists"" the means to continue to mutilate people, and give respectable artists a bad rep.Please, just say no."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"*****This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation. It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It's a very unique tea that is a true treat.This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,4.0,We liked this product. I used shrimp but did not add as directed. We do not like to cook shrimp 15 minutes. I saut'eed the shrimp and added on top of the rice when finished. I gave it a four star because I felt it could have a little more kick. Would buy again as it makes a fast meal.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I am suspicious of most of these reviews. After several months of use with limited to no sugar intake and avoidance of other provoking diets, there was no result. Again, some of these reviews are suspicious."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,1.0,"I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor. They were both disgusting. The texture was similar to a protein bar. The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor. The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice. Not a pleasant experience. I didn't finish either of them."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"This is some great Coffee:) Perks you up & gets you moving. A good tasting, highly energized morning wake up:) Even better as an afternoon pick me up. Even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I was diagnosed w/ Crohn's Disease (a type of inflammatory bowel disease). This stuff is really good. It helps a great deal in keeping my gut from hurting and keeping me living a normal life. I recommend it whole-heartedly. It's made an incredible difference.I also recommend All One powdered vitamin/mineral drink. I've only tried the original formula and phyto (green) formula. This has really increased my energy and general health. Good stuff.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"These taste just fine, but I am affraid I will break a tooth on them when I take them. They are much harder than a childs vitamin."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"The micro-steam bags are wonderful. I use them at work and when travelling and they make cleaning/sterilizing so much easier and faster. I use them on my pump parts, bottles, nipples, pacifiers... anything that can be microwaved. Definitely worth the very small price."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,3.0,"Like some of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in these. Yes they are a healthier option than traditional krispie treats, which is why they still rate a three. The taste is a little bland but ok, but they are very sticky and not easy for kids to bite. Be ready with the wet wipes for clean-up! I won't order more, if we even finish the rest."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I must say I was very skeptical when I received this massager as a gift. It looked a little clunky and is pretty heavy. However, once I turned it on and gave it a try I was pleasantly suprised.It has a really nice vibration speed and motion that is a little different compared to most massagers. Also, the rythm really is relaxing for the whole body, not just the area you have the massager directly on.I would recommend this product but wish they made it a little lighter. The wieght of it is a little cumbersome and could be a little too much for smaller individuals."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I ordered these for our Child-Care, they were the perfect size afternoon snack. There are plenty for the school age children, and the smaller ones split the packs. It was nice to have them all pre-packaged. I found the flavor and crunch to be better than the ""goldfish"" shaped crackers."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"If you've never had one of these, do yourself a favor and try one before you commit to an entire box. They're sweet, sticky, and really chewy, and they'll do a great job of giving you energy and killing your appetite. That may actually be a good thing, depending on the context.I don't eat these much lately, but there was a time when I was very busy at work, and I didn't want to take a half-hour for lunch and pay $7.00, and I didn't bring my lunch, but I had a box of these and it took only one to get me to totally forget about food for several hours. Power indeed."

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"For years I had chronic and recurring sinus infections requiring the use of antibiotics. This unit was recommended by a friend and I didn't expect much, but figured what the heck it was worth a try. Well, it is worth its weight in gold. I have not had an infection requiring antibiotics in the two years I have been using it. I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone with sinus problems. It only takes a few minutes and is very easy and comfortable to use."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"I've had this product for about a week now. And I have been using it everyday on my boyfriend who has back pain. For the price it's perfect. It has different heads that you can use on different parts of the back, and part of the handle adjusts to the motion (kind of like in some tooth brushes). He loves it and the heat is also a nice feature.The reason why I gave it 3 starts, it's because of the vibration given out by the massager, my hand gets a funny sensation, it's not too pleasant. The same applies if you're massaging yourself. So my recommendation have someone do it for you, so you can relax and enjoy.So in general for the price of 16 bucks it's a good product to have."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,5.0,"I am ordering more of these goodies. They are not only delicious and top quality, they are the most interesting assortment I have ever had, and are great for my sensitive stomach too! VERY EXCELLENT PRICE AS WELL!!"

It is the most tender beef jerky I have ever had, their is no MSG or Nitrites and the flavor is great I have tried the Hickory, Pepper & Teriyaki -- I will buy Wild Ride again..."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I love this coffee; it is absolutely wonderful!!!! The only problem is getting the coffee now. Grocery stores in my area do not stock it anymore and now I can't even get it from Amazon.com. I get upset because it is wonderful coffee and I guess I have just become addicted to it. If you haven't tried it do so the first chance you get. I have even gotten non-coffee drinkers hooked on bcause it taste so great.I wish that Folgers or (P&G;) would sell this coffee to me directly. I would buy it on a continuous basis.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,"When the world didn't know who Tim Burton was, it must have been quite a shock to realise his genius first. This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I took it and it helped me out well. I gave to my mom and it also helped her out a lot. It helped me balance my energy. It helped my mom with stomach acid. It also the real product and not fake like many of the other coral calcium products out there that are claiming to be Bob's creations.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"The product has changed, dramatically since I last purchased some about 4 months ago. It even tastes worse!! They've added High Fructose Corn Syrup and cheapened the taste. It now tastes just like their regular syrup found in all supermarkets. Even my friend said the same thing. It's no longer ""special"" and I won't be purchasing it anymore, a shame, it used to be very good!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"When I first tried these confections many years ago (in the early 90's) I instantly loved them. They are toasted sesame seeds bound together with a honey glazing. That is all - honey and sesame seeds. But boy are they good and addictive. The only negative side to this treat is that the four individual wafers contained in each package tend to stick together and sometimes they do not break away cleanly from each other. This is to be expected though given the nature of the ingredients and is a small inconvenience. The product is made in, of all places, Poland and I find it gratifying to be able to purchase a product from a country that has come so far, economically and socially, in the last 20 years. If you want a simple, delicious, and nutritious confection, look no further - this is it."

Unfortunately, this exceptional dressing is very difficult to find this in the stores, for some reason, which is why I have used Amazon to order. It's been a smooth process to place the order and receive my salad dressing."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"These were available in the Dallas area for about a nano-second. Can't buy them on the Carr's online store (WHY???). I found them at a grocery store in Kenosha, WI (I think that it was pic n save or jewel). They are incredibly good. If you can find them, horde them. If you know where they are in the Dallas area, please post this info."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I just returned from a trip to North Africa, and wanted to see if I could get this delicious appetizer locally.It is not hot, not like a tabasco hot, just flavorful. Take a small shallow dish, put in some good quality olive oil, add a heaping teaspoon of the harissa. Serve with bread for dipping - in Tunisia they use baguettes."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Even in Southern California, the winter mornings have a chill in the air, and it's nice to have a healthy bowl of oatmeal to warm and satisy the body. Quaker Instant Oatmeal packets are the perfect solution, for those with little time to cook breakfast, or those who don't want to deal with a messy saucepan afterwards.I don't have a microwave oven, but you don't need one for this product. Just put the contents of a packet (I like 2 packets!) in a bowl, and pour enough boiling water for the oatmeal to reach the consistency you like (the instructions say ""up to cup"" of water per packet). Stir for a few seconds, and you have a delicious meal. Quaker Instant Oatmeal can also be made in a microwave oven of course, and you can use milk instead of water.The Maple and Brown Sugar flavor is my favorite, but there are many others to chose from. At 160 calories a packet for the Maple and Brown Sugar, the low fat content makes it a good choice for dieters, as it is a breakfast that is nourishing and ""sticks to the ribs"" as my Mom was fond of saying (the fat content is listed as 2 grams per serving, with 0% on the saturated and trans fats). And it's a good source of fiber! And we all need lots of fiber. For those harried mothers who have to get their kids off to school, Quaker Instant Oatmeal is the answer, to give them a breakfast that has some nutritional value, is tasty, and ready to eat in seconds."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"Senseo Douwe Egbert Coffee, including regular, decaffeinated, and flavored, is delicious! A bit on the strong side, but rich in flavor. The foam on top adds to its enjoyment. Just wish that the coffee required only one pod and would brew a large mug."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,I was disappointed in both the flavor and texture of this cappucino. The foam was minimal. I find it easier to use the dark roast pod and foam my own milk (heat it in the microwave and whiz it with one of those little battery-operated whisks).

Unfortunately I had a very early miscarriage. Later I checked it for two months with BBT and found it to be accurate. Once we started trying again we happily conceived again within a few months. It takes stress out of the timing and is easy to use. I'm 38, and I was very nervous about the clock, the monitor gave me a sense of having more control over the thing ....."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I was suprised how good the Stash Holiday Chai was. I've tried many ""flavored"" hot teas and the Stash Chai is one of my favorites. If you've never tried Chai tea, it has a spicy holiday flavor, along the lines of pumpkin pie. It does come in bags, and is typical bag ""tea dust"", so you will not get the opening leaf display you will with whole tea. But if you are looking for a tasty cup of tea I recommend giving it a try."

My younger one forgets sometimes but she can always tell when she has missed a couple of days. ""Oh, I forgot my Acne pill!"" And as soon as she starts taking it again, they clear up.It's nice that it works WITH your body chemistry, not against it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I prefer the strawberry bars, but Amazon stopped selling them at the time I was buying. I tried these and was very happy with the taste. They didn't have any aftertaste that some power bars have. Very good overall."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,4.0,"This is a must for those who love chocolate and hazelnut. Hazelnuts are not nearly as popular in the USA as they are in Europe. When I visited my family in Europe, I really loved all the chocolate and hazelnut desserts there and was sad to discover it's hard to find such things in the USA. This spread is delicious but after you have eaten a real chocolate hazelnut torte (a cake-like, layered brownie type thing I had) nothing is quite the same. Either way, this is great on crepes, cake, waffles and as one other reviewer mentioned, graham crackers! Another interesting treat is to have it on fruit or make a peanut butter and chocolate sandwich."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"It is the first time i am using this product. It works great and does what it is supposed to. Also, when taking it, I have developed aversion to certain junk foods and soda is absolutely off limits. I suppose it is a positive effect you need to cleanse your body, but in addition i got stomach cramps that interfere with my daily life."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,Bought this at the pet store and paid much more for it. Tt was called cat caviar. I sprinkle the flakes on my cats food or just feed for a treat by itself. They love it! Its simple and easy to store in the fridge after I open it or put in a air tight container.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"These are some good cookies. Upon first trying them, I never would have guessed that they are all natural and made with organic ingredients. I felt bad eating cookies while pregnant, until I found these. There is no reason I can't at least have an organic, natural cookie at this point if these exist.Plus you are only paying a little over $2.00/bag with the package deal Amazon offers. Shipping was also free when I bought the pack of 12 bags of cookies.Not bad!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"I'd give this chair 0 stars if that was an option. The chair seemed great at first in helping my son sit upright and practice his sitting skills. He started using the chair around 4 months old. I was very careful in using this chair. I only put him in it when it was on the floor and I was always nearby to supervise. One day my son was reaching for a toy next to the chair and he fell completely out of the chair flat onto his face. Luckily he wasn't hurt and there was no furniture nearby for him to bump into, but this could've been a very serious and scary hazard. The chair seems like a great idea, but I really want all parents to know that it is not safe. I have written the company to complain and am awaiting a full refund. DON'T USE THIS CHAIR FOR YOUR BABY."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,The mints are good and some of the flavors are a little unusual
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I seriously love this bowl and spoon. The bowl fits nicely in your hand so it's easy to feed a squirming baby. The spoon has a very soft tip so you don't have to worry about hurting their gums. My daughter is a year old and mostly feeds herself, but we are still using the bowl for snacks or I'll put yogurt in one side and fruit in the other. The lid always stays on and the bowl still looks new even though we've used them a lot. I would highly recommend this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The Essence of Vali Soothing Mist for Sleep is an exotic lemony forest of scents with an instantly relaxing result. One inhalation and you feel calmer. Spray this on your pillow to fall asleep fast.Essential oils of lavender, cedar, marjoram and ylang/ylang are blended to create a calming sensory environment. I use this in combination with Hyland's Calms or Bach's Rescue Remedy for a good night's sleep.~The Rebecca Review"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,The kids made these beans for the first time today. They added some salsa for extra flavor. We all thought they tasted great.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,4.0,"Sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise. They're not over-sweet nor over-hot, and they've got a lot of flavor and texture. Over all I'd say they're among the best snacks you can buy, not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves. However the price is pretty high for the amount you get. Even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack, it's a little high. However, for the occasional treat, it's well worth the price. It's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,3.0,"I bought these for my kids. I like them, but my kids did not care for them too much. They took a few bits then they just left them on the table."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"This is how hot chocolate should taste! It is a little hard to stir compared to the cheaper brands, but well worth the effort. Parents keep this away from your kids and save the good stuff for yourself."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I have one of those jobs where I can suddenly have to spend all day out in the literal boonies. So just in case I carry lots of water and a couple of these in the tote bag, and that's sufficient for 8+ hours. But, no, at 250 calories each, these are NOT snacks. It reminds me of a malady that sprang up in the 1970's - ""Granola belly""."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Got exactly what I wanted in decent ship time. Price was good for a 2 pack.
health personal care,health care,unknown,2.0,"Although the quality of this plastic kit is quite good, I understood the description to mean that an assortment of homeopathic preparations was included so was very disappointed to find I had purchased only the storage unit. I think the description could be written more clearly."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"I liked this tea but it is kind of regular in flavor. It doesn't stand out in my opinion. It is just there in taste. So if it is on sale buy it, if not pass."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I just started to use it three days ago and I feel a relief of my sympotm of vaginal yeast infection (I am with it for at least five years, some medicine helps, but it constantly comes back). I am glad to try this product."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"My son is 13 months old and has been using this cup for about a month. We tried many other sippy cups but this one works the best because he doesn't have to hold the cup up to get the fluid out. He can drink from the straw when the cup is in all different postions. The top screws on to the cup, so even when he throws the cup on the floor the fluid stays in the cup 95% of the time. (It leaks periodically)"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,1.0,"I din't love these at all. The flavor combinations struck me as off, there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa. Also the texture was unpleasant, somewhat soggy. I like the healthy aspect, but if you aren't enjoying the experience why eat at all?"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"We got a case of these and the strawberry flavor. LOVE THEM! They do look a tad odd, as I remember a previous reviewer mentioning, but that's because the fruit has oxidized (which only changes the color, not the flavor). They taste great!My 2-year old loves these fruit snacks. They taste better than the nasty artificial flavor you get from the usual fruit roll-up type of candy (because, really, that other stuff is just glorified candy!) and they're much less detrimental to a healthy diet.I'm just really excited that we have a really tasty, sweet, portable snack that doesn't have sugar and corn syrup and chemicals in it! Plus no cores or seeds to throw away!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"About a month ago, I ordered this when it was on an Amazon special. My back has become increasingly troublesome, and I've been treating the sore spots with portable heat pads. Heat helps a lot! This is one feature that I WISH this massaging cushion had -- heat with movement would be perfect.I love the kneading action, though, even if it is a little rough at times. Mainly, the rough spots just indicate to me where I am holding tension and, as I work through the pain, my back, shoulders and neck no longer feel creaky. My posture seems to be improving as I've become more conscious of how I sit and stand. The rolling action doesn't do much for me -- seems a little weak. I can't seem to position myself so that it has some purpose.I'm still experimenting with all the possibilities and what works best for me. It's a whole lot better than those units that just jiggle."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I use Bob's Red Mill wheat gluten flour for making seitan, a wheat-gluten ""meat"" familiar to vegans and vegetarians. It is very easy to use, is obviously high-quality, and keeps well. I've found Bob's works the best out of all the brands for this use. I just wish that it was organic and that they made bigger bags (the case comes with a lot of packaging, which seems like a waste)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I used to drink coffee throughout the day and tried lots of flavored green teas, that I thought were okay. The first box of Roobis Red Chai was different. I immedietly got hooked, but couldn't just say it was the taste. I felt better. I have asmtha, and being allergy season it started kicking up. Drinking this tea seemed to bring relief. When my store raised its price to over $4.00 a box I visited Kalaharis website. It confirmed what I had already found-good for asmtha, and a lot else. I've also tried the plain red but didn't care for it. Amazon offers a terrific deal for six boxes."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,"I bought this for my picky 5yo, since she'll actually eat this for lunch at school. I didn't even THINK for a second to check the ingredients to see if the trans-fat ridden and cheap ""Partially Hydrogenated"" oil was used to make FROOT LOOPS. -I mean, really! I cannot believe that in the year 2006, Kellogs is still using such cheap and unhealthy ingredients in their cereals, which are aimed at kids!! They have at least attempted to make this cereal seem ""healthy"" by lowering the sugar content, but would be even better if they took out the partially hydrogenated crap!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,1.0,"I Don't know how they can say plump and juicy..my were dried out so hard I could crack them in my hand.The delivery time wasn't bad.....too bad the black berries were of such poor quality.' Were these supposed to be freeze dried? It didn't mention that in the description nor any instructions as how to ""plump em' back up""?I'm very disappointed."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,2.0,"These have the same basic shape and consistency of a Cheeto, so they are nicely crunchy, but aren't hot or spicy. In fact, they don't have much flavor at all."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,I purchased two of these for my preemie twins. They love to relax on these pillows. There is a lot of flexibilty with the various attachments. The sides are very suportive and can be adjusted as they grow. I would recommend buying this over other products due to the design and flexibility.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"If you like a good spicy sauce, then this is just right for you! Not too hot, kind of sweet, just right for anything that needs an extra kick without the heat! Yum!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"MET-Rx definitely make the best protein powders I've tried so far -- and I've tried about a half-dozen brands and looked at the nutritional information for others that I ruled out due to their high caloric content. You can click on the link above to see the manufacturer's nutritional information label, but the key point is that almost all of the calories in this powder come from the whey protein. In other words this powder is very low fat and low carb yet it still tastes very good. I like both the vanilla and chocolate flavors and alternate between them so I'm not drinking the same thing post-workout every day."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"This is a great pump. It's so easy to use amd it works! There are very few parts to clean and unlike the Medela, you don't have to clean the tubing because of the closed system. I've never had any problems with it."
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,"....but dont use for contact lens handling inless you wash first.I use disposable gloves for everything, the best use yet is cleaning contact lens, my normal choice is the purple nyplex they are thick and textured, when I used these my eyes burned - probably from a chemical they have on them, so I have to wash them before use to remove it and they work well, dont like the added inconvience but got to burn though a case before I go back to purple."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"The calories and fat are far less than a candy bar, and it's far more satisfying. I don't get nearly enough vitamins, and these bars give me a better start. There's no corn syrup, plenty of protein, and so many vitamins I found a few I didn't recognize.Amazon has a great price for 15 bars, less than a dollar a piece! Don't be afraid to try these! The Peppermint Stick bars taste just like thin mint Girl Scout Cookies! I like Caramel Nut Brownie too, in fact, the only one that didn't fit my tastes was the Lemon Zest.They're fit for a lady's health, but I'm very sure anyone can enjoy these."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I usually carry a bottle of Cytomax when running in the hot Hawaiian sun...does a great job at replenishing fluids and electrolytes. Works well as a recovery drink too. Cool citrus isn't a bad flavor. I can't say that Cytomax would stand on its own as a tasty beverage. Nevertheless, it's a decent taste that's palatable."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"This assortment of Adagio teas is interesting. I am fond of the Ceylonese bands and black teas. The others were not good; I discarded them after one cup. This is loose tea, by-the-way, in case someone thought they were bagged teas."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"If you like the original, you'll like this fruity flavorful tea in the green version. And if green is truly healthier, well then it just gets better."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,I like this product for two reasons
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,I love this jerky. I have to watch myself because I can't get enough of this jerky. ALl the flavors are great but this is my favorite.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I like them all except for the Earl Grey, but that could be taste preference."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"Very nicely constructed, and the service from the seller was truly rare in it's excellence and personally professionaly touch.The zafu was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but it was exactly what it should have been. It was my expectation that was off. Great item."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"Poor quality for the inside cotton, it breaks in parts easily. Too many printed publicity not wanted or asked my authorization to be sent."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This product is excellent! The only caution I would suggest is to not use too much of it at one time as it can be bitter. I use approximately 85%-90% Stevia liquid and 10%-15% Spenda and the resuts are excellent!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag. California does some things better than us here in Indiana, coffee is one of them."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"Although the package says this is a soup, we prepare it and pour it over white rice for a delicious and easy cuban style side dish. The taste is fresh and the texture creamy. Add some shredded cheese for a satisfying soup high in fiber and calcium."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,Not my cup of tea! No doubt the quality is good. But soooooooooooooo strong. Where is the delicate tea?
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"Most people get their blood sugar monitors free. I was fortunate to be given the One Touch Ultra by Lifescan. I used to discuss the problems my sister had with hers and could never understand why she was having so much difficulty.One Touch Ultra is quick, almost painless and easy to use. Of course these test strips are pricy. They all are. About a buck a piece. But there's not much you can do about that."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I am trying in my middle age to develop some adult responsibility, thus bought this First Aid kit for the Jeep. Will likely never use it, but if I do it seems to have everything for wounds, bug bites, blisters, etc. Well designed, clear instructions, compact size. Have used many kits, in many different situations, this one is very well thought out."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"Needless to say I drink alot of coffee butthis Cafe Caribe espresso coffee is truly not one of my favorites at all.Not to keen on the taste whether made in Espresso pot or french press.Could it be that since I am not Latino, and lack the Latino taste(as item description states???)that this coffee did not suit me? I doubt it!To make things worse, Amazon could not seem to be able to fulfill this order correctly. They kept sending me 1- 10 oz brick instead of 6 listed, not just once but 3 times....I was refunded half of my order cost.Good thing these were not gifts for Christmas!On a positive note"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Where I live, I know of no stores that carry this tasty, healthy drink. I received my order in a timely fashion in great condition at a fair price. Thanks!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,I purchased this product for my mom. She has trouble with RA in her neck. She has used the Therabeads cervical and finds it pretty easy to use and helpful. The hard part is that you must take it out of the sleeve each time before micro-waving and then put the sleeve on it again. This is not easy for my mom. It does warm up enough and keep warm for a period of time which does help. I would recommend this product.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"This is absolutely the best relish-style hot sauce available. I first tasted it at the restaurant, which closed several years ago. It's great in cajun dishes, as well as in chili and on sandwiches."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've been taking Primal Defense for a year and a half and it has made a huge difference in my life. I used to have chronic constipation and intense food allergies. Within two months I noticed a big difference (you really need to take at least three tablets a day or more to have good results). I didn't want to spend so much for something that I knew I'd have to take for the rest of my life but now I'm happy to pay for it, I've seen so many benefits. After two months I noticed that my body was purging all kinds of gunk, I was shocked at what was coming out of me, basically a lot more than I was putting in. I had read that that could happen but it was strange to actually experience it. This went on for about 6 months but it wasn't a horrible experience at all and I felt sooooo much better afterwards. My food allergies went away completely and so did my constipation. I also have absolutely no problems when I travel. My hair, skin and nails look amazing too. I think that is because my body can actually absorb the vitamins and minerals better. Primal Defense and OmegaZyme are amazing products and, although they may seem pricey, making this investment can actually change your life!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've tried other types of ""chai"" tea, both teabags and powdered, and find this product the best tasting -- and at a lower cost and calories than powdered -- when I add sweetener and milk. This has become a staple in my kitchen -- I love it!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"With the addition of soy and milled flaxseed, this whole grain couscous, with its 10 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber per serving, is a nutritious, flavorfull alternative to plain refined couscous.Try a simple recipe mixing the couscous with peas and carrots (an easy meal for camping trips) or more exotic, mixing couscous with dried cranberries, cashews, ginger and garlic. Yum."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"After taking this products for 3-4 weeks, my condition improved. (I also took calcrate plus). I do believe this product improved the functions of my intestines."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"The directions and the test worked very well. The accuracy was very good. I had an A1c blood test with my doctor within 3 weeks of the Biosafe test and the results were within .1 of each other. I only had to stick my finger one time, painlessly I might add. So I would highly recommend the test if you are interested."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,I got it out of the package and followed the instructions but it didn't even warm my bottle. Consequently now i use it as a bottle carrier but thats it.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,Half the cost of the name brand and looks almost identical. Great for reading - my husband loves it.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"At one time in my life I used the sweetener in the little blue packet, then switched to the pink packet, but NOW ""they"" tell me the yellow packet containing SPLENDA is the healthiest.Since diabetes runs in my family, I don't want to risk getting that disease or gaining too much weight, so I hope ""they"" are right in promoting this product.I've been using it for about a year ... mostly on certain brands of cereal and my hot oatmeal. It actually enhances the flavor of things I sprinkle it on and actually tastes like it's suppose to"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is a great product and very heart healthy. It was packaged very good and except for there not being enough in stock at the time of my order, I received it in a timely manner."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I heard about these bars from the author of The Lupus Recovery Diet. Shesent me a bar with my recent CD purchase and I loved it. I have since purchased bars at Whole Foods and was so pleased to see them offered here.The Pecan Pie tastes so wonderful. Just like a piece of pecan pie. Myfavorites are the cinnamon roll and chocolate coconut.I read the other review regarding calories and fat, but these bars are healthy and so filling. I have one for breakfast on the run, or as a midafternoon snack. With a plant based diet, I am not concerned about the calories and find the bars so satisfying. These are the best tasting bars I have ever tried. It sounds like a commercial, but I honestly am in love with this product. I have ordered 4 cases for our household. My kids love them too and they are way better than the cookies and other sweet processed snacks offered for lunches."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"The tea flavor is fine. After 2 cups, minimal energy boost, really no more than drinking a plain black tea. I likely will not purchase this type again, but contiune to be a strong fan of Celestial Seasonings."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"I didn't have high expectations for this product based upon previous experience with Homedics. Although ours is new and we cannot vouch for it's durability, the massaging action on the back is just wonderful.If there is a flaw, it's that the width adjustment is only available on the vertical roller settings. It would be really good if that were available on the shiatsu settings too. Maybe that's the way the next model up works, but it wasn't clear in any of the product descriptions.The most useless feature is a vibrator in the seat portion. I suppose that's nice if you're female."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,1.0,"Awful. Feels cheap. Looks cheap. But isnt cheap. Harness connection is IMPOSSIBLE. Seat doesnt support my 5 month old (though she's within the guidelines). Harness/restraints wont tighten enough--that doesnt matter though, as I cant unlatch the clips. They're cheap clips requiring too much force and time. The tray is too easy to get offtrack (I can see why other reviewers had related safety problems)An additional tray is pointless. Its not as if you'll use one while the auxilliary tray is in the dishwasher... it wont fit!!!Sure, this high chair does all the things the chairs of this class do"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I bought Now's 5-HTP with the intention of using it as a sleep aid. I found that it is best taken in the morning as the effects are calming instead of sleep inducing. It will smooth out the rough spots in your day and make time slide on by without tension or anxiety. I sometimes take this along with melatonin for sleep and boy the two combined can really give you a plesent and recuperative sleep. I recommend trying it.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,5.0,"This packaged smoothie was excellent -- I liked the taste and will keep looking for it in the stores. It was especially nice to have on a trip to use as a snack. Also, it is just filling enough to ward of hunger pangs in the late afternoon.I heard about this product from the Hungry Girl website and decided to try it. I attempted to purchase this product at Wegmans Market in Bridgewater, NJ but they said it was a ""summer item."" That is when I figured Amazon. com would certainly have it -- and they did."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"These mustards (I ordered three varieties) were not available in my market.At last I found them on the web via Amazon.Arrived in a well packed condition.I will order more, no doubt.Charles"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Source of Life multivitamins are the best multivitamin available without a lot of fillers or synthetic ingredients. They give you a boost and keep your immune system in great shape. I highly recommend them! I haven't taken over 1 or 2 days of sick leave per year in over 5 years.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING ANY QUANTITY AT LOCAL STORES. THIS WAS 1/2 THE PRICE AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A 3 MONTH SUPPLY! (I HAVE PLENTY OF FREEZER SPACE.) THE EXTRA WAS HAVING IT DELIVERED TO THE DOOR! I'LL BE BACK TO THIS SITE FOR PURCHASING GROCERIES. THANKS!!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,I'm very pleased with this product. The price is much better than any that I've found elsewhere. The product is high quality and is certified organic. I would definitely order this again. The flavor of red quinoa is very nutty and is much tastier than regular quinoa.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"Twice they sent me cartons of the wrong variety. Once it was ""Movie Theater Butter,"" forgot what they sent the other time.I was credited back for my purchase, because they are unable to receive returned food products. They never were able to successfully fill the order, and we gave up.I love this particular product, it contains 0% transfats, low salt, yet it is delicious and tastes as sweet as candy to me.Unfortunately, I will have to rely on my local supermarket, which is often out of the product"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,2.0,These plastic/vinyl pants are fair. They really didnt do a very good job at controlling leaks. They were smaller in dimensions than expected. The crotch width wasnt enough to cover even a very thin disposable diaper. And they didnt ride high enough in either the front or the back to be effective. I would not buy them again. i would probly order a pair of leakmasters.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,The reviews of this product were poor before I bought it. But when I received it I didn't see what all the complaints were about. If your not a pro and just want a functional table this is an affordable option.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"My son is one years old, and he's about 27lbs. This Chair is very strong, and steady once clap on the table.One shortcome is it has to be installed on a very strong or heavy table, otherwise the table will not stay put with the weight of my son. So I'm not able to use it at all restaurants though."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I broke my nose years ago in high school and it healed crooked, so I cannot breathe very well at night. In the mornings, I always woke up feeling tired, like I never slept at all. I would sleep with my mouth open and would have a sore throat every morning.Nozovent has been a godsend. I sleep like a baby, with my mouth closed, because my nasal passages are opened and I can breathe easily and normally with Nozovent. I wake up feeling refreshed, revived and no longer have a dry, sore throat in the morning.Nozovent is the next best thing to nasal surgery and a lot cheaper."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,2.0,"Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product. However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita. These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor. Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired. If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it. If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it. My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"this came in a timely fashion and was just what i wanted. the price is very good, too. thanks."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I would give this product a 5 star rating for taste, except for the fact that it they contain GREEN TEA extract. I think that you should list (or provide a link to) the product ingredients and nutritional info. I am allergic to green tea but having eating the Clif bars and other similar meal bars, which do not contain Green Tea, it didn't occur to me that these would."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"The coffee is great and packaged nicely if giving as a gift. The service was fast, I received my order in 3 days during the holiday season."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is the best jasmine tea in a bag that I've ever had. The flavor lasts through a second cup too! It also taste good with milk and sugar.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Garlic tobasco is pretty scarce in grocery stories and the like. And even if you find it, it's usually the tiny bottle, which doesn't last long and clogs up easily at the opening.Thus, ordering this full-sized bottle is completely worth it.Oh right, and the flavor is awesome. It's very mild in terms of spiciness. but that makes it more versatile, IMHO. Goes absolutely great with pizza or anything even somewhat Italian."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,I found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack. I have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just don't taste that good. Nice surprise.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,This is a product I use daily and found a great deal on Amazon that saved me a lot of money.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Its worth the name brand cost because it truly helps w/performance - I feel more fatigued during the day when I skip it. Try it, you'll like it"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,Perfect one portion size. Quick and easy to make. Great source of fiber and protein and low in fat. Great and spicy tasting!!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"Call it either being in a rut or being smart enough to stay with something good, I have some form of Taylor's of Harrogate ""... Breakfast"" tea first thing every morning. I've mostly stuck with the British Isles with the English, Irish and Scottish Breakfast teas. Can't say I hugely prefer one over the other; they all give just the right taste and kick for the morning. I like the big 2-cup bags too. I just make an oversize cup of tea for myself and it lasts a bit longer."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,1.0,"Wish I could give NO STARS! My husband is a ""Mikey"", he'll eat anything, anything except these bars! They are terrible. Called customer service to request refund or store credit. Was informed ""that is the risk you take when you order food online"". Guess ordering grocery items from Amazon is just ""too risky"". Very poor customer service and quite a disappointment. Was a big Amazon fan until dealing with their poor customer service reps today."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,"The product is excellent. Tasty, crunchy, hot as wasabi can be,but the hotness desappears just in time to grab another handfull. People who like Japanese food will certainly enjoy to nibble Kasugai."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,4.0,"A little thinner than I had wished for, but they are in a great, larger size and the low price is amazing! They also arrived very quickly, and they had free shipping!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"Comes un assembled but is easily put together. The finish is good and the fit is good too. It allows the infant ( useful into junior years ) to sit at the table with parents and guests. It is not in place of a traditional high chair but allows for socialization of the child.I noted that it did not come with glides for the bottom, which would be needed on hardwood floors or any floor that could scratch."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"These Senseo pods are easy to use, great tasting and a decent find on Amazon.com. Simply put into your Senseo and your ready to go. I often use two at a time since I like stronger coffee, but regardless, it's simple, and great tasting."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,A pleasant surprise. i couldnt find Vaedemeum so I tried this and am very pleased with the taste and the smoothness of my teeth after I brush
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,Would recommend for babies from 4 months up. This has been and still is great for my daughter. She's only 7 months old and is not yet comfortable in a high chair. This booster is the best.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"This is by far the best gluten free pasta out there. I have tried rice pasta, corn pasta, etc. The rice/millet mix finally gets it right! Just do not overcook. Great mouthfeel, not slimy, or too firm or soft, and great with a variety of toppings/sauces and in soups.HIGHLY recommend!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"I bought this bug spray to combat the amount of mosquitoes there are in the Alaskan atmosphere, and was pretty pleased with it. I especially liked the scent, which is citrus and zippy, much nicer than your typical lumberjack scented bug repellent. I wouldn't reccomend it to someone canvassing the rain forests, but it's a good basic repellent for daily use or picnics or something where you don't want to smell like you were coated in DEET beforehand. It comes in a cute metal bottle with a spray nozzle, but it doesn't produce a mist of spray, you'll actually apply this more like a handful of tanning oil or lotion, with your hand."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,5.0,"There should be some sort of Surgeon General's warning on these they are so good. With all the high fat and high sugar cheeze puffs most people are used to these may taste somewhat bland at first bite, but believe me you'll be craving it soon enough. I offered my neighbor a handful and even though he thought they were just okay he came back ten minutes later and asked for an entire bag. My dorm room is full of sugary pop tarts and rice krispy treats, but I always go for these first and I think that kept me from gaining too much weight during finals."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,These are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself. Whenever we are out at a restaurant I just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table. Who knows what they wipe those tables with?! This is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on!
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,5.0,"These are our new favorite breakfast food. FANTASTIC!!!! We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes. The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts. Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so. This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried. Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,Wonderful product! Too delicious for words. I will order this again and again!
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,"I started eating crispbread when I was beginning my Weight Watcher's program, 60 pounds ago! They replaced my fatty snacks as well as higher calorie crackers and breads. The Dark Rye by Ryvita is my favorite, I love to put reduced-fat cream cheese on them, and they are fine alone as well. My only issue is they break easily when I'm spreading the cheese. I highly recommend this product and purchasing it through Amazon, it was cheaper than the price at my local organic grocery store."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Best stuff ever !! I should get some of this stuff for free for all the people i've gotten to start purchasing it.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I drink alot of tea and Lady Grey is one of my favourites. The citrus undertones are soothing and complimentary any time of the day. Lady Grey is refreshing hot as well as iced, lending itself well to any situation. I was very happy to find it available here."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"Crisp when chilled and refreshing without synthetic flavorings or added sucrose, Zico is the packaged beverage my yard men prefer. The smart-paper carton packaging created less bulk waste than canned drinks, and nature's own engineering packs this fruit punch with five electrolytes, the most overtly critical of which is potassium. I didn't think I would like this product but bought it because I cannot quite manage the full-time taste for spring water and herbal tea my yoga regime suggests. VERY helpful for those weaning themselves off alcohol and conventional mystery soda-pop."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"This was practical and on a friend's Baby Registry, useful and used daily. Because I do not have children, I would of not known to pick this! Great gift."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,1.0,"I am anxious to find salted/cheese flavored snacks.....well the salt/grated cheese shakers are a lot more appealing. The aftertaste may send you right for the Hershey bar. There is also a funky stomache feeling too. I was desperate enough to try this stuff twice (I did have a box of 12)....it wasn't the result of a bad first impression, these chips are just awful....."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"When used at least 6 days per week for 15 minutes it does a great job at nearly eliminating breakouts and keeping skin clear for my 14 year old daughter. I got the light because I had noticed that she did not break out during the summmer months, and hoped that using this light would have a similar effect, and it does. Much better results than benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products alone have had. We have found that she can skip one day, but if 2 days are missed, breakouts reoccur. I think that over time it will pay for itself when considering what I have spent on expensive over-the-counter acne treatments. We are now getting by with just an inexpensive Equate brand cleanser and a foundation for acne-prone skin."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,4.0,"I liked these. They were a bit spicy, but a slice of chedder melted on top turned them into a very high protein nacho.The lemon herb were horrible. Smelled musty and stale. Poor combination of herbs with the lemon. They became expensive dog treats.Would buy again.....but never the lemon herb..yuk"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I have a friend who finds this product works very well.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I too bought this for a road trip I was taking. It worked like a charm. As a little warning
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"Out of the box this product was great, but it seems to lose its cool fairly quickly. Perhaps I'm using it incorrectly but I thought it would stay cool for at least a month at a time."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,3.0,"At $18 with free (Prime) shipping, these are much cheaper than Red Bull, etc. They also don't pack the same punch, but they seem to be healthy and they do help in the morning routing. The taste is okay, seems to have a weird aftertaste. Goes nicely with Vodka (can I say that?). I won't order this flavor again, but I am trying some of the others..."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I read many of the reviews prior to purchase and bought this product anyway. One person expressed it clearly stating something to the fact of it has a great demo mode, but no way to combine the rolling and shaitsu any other time. That is my one criticism of the product. The size and weight are fine and the lights are not bright if you use the cover provided. I would suggest unplugging the unit after each use so the lights don't burn out."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,1.0,I love the product and have bought at other places. The reason I bought this from Amazon is they had a deal that allowed me to buy it for much less per bag than other places. When I got it I noticed one of the 12 bags was opened already. OK I was still in the black on the deal but after I put it on the shelf for a few days I pulled it down to get another bag and 3 more were open. 4 of the 12 bags were open and that isn't acceptable.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"This device is clearly not for everyone. It's heavy, hard to manuever, and can be hurtful. It can also be blissful, relieving a painful constriction in, e.g., a calf and/or shoulder muscle. I think people who've had experience with shiatsu or even rolfing might be better prepared to use this machine properly and effectively. If you prefer light-touch, swedish massage, this may not be your cuppa.If you've never heard and/or don't understand the instruction, ""breathe into the pain"", think twice before getting one of these."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,Barely a step up from canned supermarket brands. It's not bad but just not worth the cost. For [$...].(current sale price) one can do much better.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"At our YMCA facility since we do not have a freezer, we need this product for emergency care for our members. The product works!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,GEORGE'S ALOE VERA JUICE IS THE PUREST AND THE BEST THAT ANYONE COULDEVER BUY. THE QUALITY IS ALWAYS AT ITS BEST.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I couldn't wait for this item to be available. I love it!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,5.0,"If you are just starting out w/ espresso, or looking for a new brand-THIS IS FOR YOU! I thought this was great. It gives you 2 of each. You are able to try so many different types of espresso in just 1 purchase. See what you like & go from there. I actually enjoyed all of them. I give this sampler 5 stars."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"My HoMedics luxury footbath died an unnatural death after 3 months of extremely light use - it worked fine the first three times I used it, then there was a break over the holidays, and I returned to it only to find that the bubbler or massager was dead - the water stayed hot but no bubbles and no power jet. Although inexpensive when compared to some of the other high dollar foot spas, it turned out to be pretty expensive when you consider its working life - I would not buy this brand again."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"I too like these cups with the exception that the design scratches off. This started happening immediately when my daughter started using them. After about 6 months, most of the design was gone leaving just enough to make the cups look extremely worn and old. I didn't want to buy new sippy cups because they don't leak and are otherwise great cups. I eventually ended up gently rubbing a green pot scrubbing pad over them to get the remaining paint off of them. Sadly, my daughter just has plain pink and purple cups with no princesses now!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I combined this tea with Fenugreek seed capsules and I could tell a difference after the first day! I'm not engorged by any means, but I definitely pump more milk than I did before."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,These are covered with chocolate that provides a sweet counterpoint to the peanut butter. It is a very filling bar with a nice texture (rather than to waxy one most protein bars have)and is not sickly sweet. It is a nice morning snack that gives a great boost of energy and sneeks in a couple more hours before you have to stop for lunch. If I could give them 10 stars I would.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had been using ""Fibermucil"" by Andrew Lessman, taking anywhere from 5-8 a day. I was truly suprized to find that this particular product (Vitamin Shoppe - Psyllium Husk With Acidophilus, 600 capsules) works much better, faster and with no bloating. I only need 2 a day. I'm very happy with this purchase...and it's much more cost effective than Lessman's!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,1.0,These are disgusting! I do not recomend this product at all..... Don't waste $19.00 because that is what you'll spend after shipping!!!!!!!!!!!
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,butter,5.0,"Home-churned flavor that can't be found in the grocery store! This is just like grandma used to make from her own cows' milk. It's in one solid block, not in quarters like the store bought stuff."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,This has been a great booster seat. We bought one 5 years ago and used it for both kids. It folds up nice and is durable and easy to clean. We used to take it camping with us and strap it to the picnic tables. Best booster seat we ever tried!
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This product was marketed in many stores - Amazon was $25 cheaper than Kohl's, who (and obviously) falsely claimed to have the lowest price. The delivery, one week before Christmas, took under twenty four hours to my home."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"A genious came up with the idea to make this shape around the shoulders and neck!! Love it! I also have the regular size TheraTherm and I highly recommend them both. I love the digital display to set your temp and timer to shut-off, cause I sometimes fall asleep and don't have to worry about it being left on. These pads are heavy weight so they slide around and you never add water, it's idiot-proof!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,Using this product with the Grossan Hydro Puls Nasal and Sinus Irrigation Ssytem has been a god-send. I breathe a lot better now.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I have been using it to keep coffee beans as well as the grounds. It woorkswell but you need the pump to create the seal between the lid and canister.
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,5.0,"And why do I know this? My CATS ordered some for themselves. Only they ordered 50 gallons for the low, low price of $779.47! Damn cats! Their coats are so sleek and shiny now, though."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition. I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies. I bought a starter kit and several other bottles. I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak. I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid. Nothing helped. My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them. I switched to another brand and now we are very dry.
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,1.0,"It looks incredibly comfortable and in fact, it even feels that way when you touch it. The way that it molds to your hand gives the impression that it will provide the best night's sleep possible. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard when you actually use it for sleep.As someone who sleeps on my stomach, it is even more painful. If I slept on my back I think it would be a little bit better, but I could never see myself using this on a regular basis.Also of note, the fact that this is only sold in standard size a bit disappointing.I thought that this could finally be the pillow to take the place of my old (and falling apart) foam rubber pillow that I've been using for 20 years...but it seems that my search will continue. Does anyone still make the classic style pillow made with heavy foam rubber? The closest I can find is a latex foam pillow, which has the same kind of sleep, but is way too light."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"These drinks are SO GOOD, so much better than the low calorie no sugar things in the regular marketplace. No aftertaste, it makes me feel like a kid again drinking that stuff that left a smile shape on my mouth after drinking it. I am hooked and back for more. The price is very good too for something of this quality. Try it and you won't be sorry!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!- Kasia S."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This doesn't actually massage your head, but it sure gives a great scratching sensation. The only problem is that a couple of the balls at the end of the wires have a rough spot on them. They don't hurt, but aren't as smooth as the others."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"All our systems are different, but this seems to be a real winner for mine!I take one cap about 11pm and 1 about 4am.Digestion/elimination seem truly improved."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I was suppose to be able to PICK which kind of tea that I wanted and it was not offered to me. I did receive 2 boxes of Red Rose Mountain Tea for $16.88 including shipping and handling. I wanted the Red Rose Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea Bags. Well since this is what I'm suppose to give a review on, I can't because I wasn't sent this kind. The ones I received, I don't care for; but for $16.88 they will be used. It would have been nice to get what I ordered.Thanks,Betty Jean King318 Planett StreetLaPorte, IN 46350"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,Glitter was pretty on my pastries but I was under the impression it would be flavorless and it actually had a yucky aftertaste.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,He did not know if he would but he loves them. Great for a quick snack or a snack to go. Please don't quit selling these. Glad we bought them and will buy more.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"This is a well made alternative to the very expensive Stokke chairs. It works on the same principles but includes plastic knobs for adjustments - so you don't have to mess with the allen wrench. We never even installed the lap bar and took the saftey straps off right away. Our 6 yr old feels like a big girl - no more figetting and complaining when sitting at the table!I can't figure out if it was made in Germany (where the company is based) or in Virginia - the address on the original box. It usually says made in XYZ, but it didn't.Also, we got the Junior Pad-Orange (Mouse Print) for $9.99, a great value over the other colors going for $25.99!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"These are the most fabulous snack ever! No additives, nothing but pure delicious tomatoes. For those of us who want to eat a healthy snack and don't have a sweet tooth, there's nothing better. They're chewy and it takes a few minutes to eat them so they're great for keeping your weight down.I don't think they'd be very good for any other use, but if I had to name ONE food to be my overall favorite to snack on, nothing else would even come close!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"I read where Orville wanted to come out with a different kind of popcorn and when he marketed kettle korn, he knew what he was doing. A blend of sweet and sour coats every kernel."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,3.0,"You will like these. They are rich and heavy. Soft and chewy. They are not low-fat.Personally, I prefer the crunchier pecan varieties."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I tried this tea recently and It tasted just fine. It tasted better to me than they're regular black tea, but I have tasted other brands that have tasted just as good as this too. I wish the bags were sealed to prevent them from gradually losing their flavor though. You can use a mesh screen tea ball to do the same thing with loose tea, if you dont wanna pay extra for the pyramids."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,this heat pack does not hold its heat as well as others I have had. Also although it appears in the picture that it is sewn in sections it is not. As a result the material inside slides to the bottom making it uneven if you try and use it sitting upright. I'm also not nuts about the aroma.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love these vitamins. I started taking the larger-pill version which worked great but were sometimes hard for me to swallow. So I found this smaller-pill version and have had no problems at all. They make me feel great, too. I am taking prenatals right now and therefore am on hiatus with these, but my Husband is taking them and he loves them (this is a man who never took vitamins before and never liked to).This is a nice vitamin and I recommend it!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"My husband and I were trying to conceive and were having no luck for 4 months, and then the FIRST month I used Preseed, wham-o! Big fat positive pregnancy test! I know that doesn't scientifically prove anything, but it is certainly possible that PreSeed made a difference for us."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,2.0,Crusher worked great on large hard pills until it broke after about 5th use.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I got this for my son when he was turned 1 so he could join us at the table. This seat is great, I wish I would have bought it sooner. The only thing is the tray pops off too easy so my son was able to pop it off right from the begining. I only use it at the dinner table & I love that the height is so easy to adjust."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"While some of Larabars have a thick grainy-nut texture, this particular product is very smooth and almost tastes like chocolate candy. For those of us who can't eat real candy because of allergies, this one is a winner! It almost tastes like a soft Girl Scout thin mint cookie."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,I Love these veggie chips. these chips are so full of flavor that you will not just pop whole chips in your mouth like regular potato chips. You will want to nibble on these and enjoy every little bite of them. They are also colorful and would look nice for serving guests. So Yummmmmmy! What a great treat. Each different veggie chip has it's own destinct flavor.Buy these to share.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,2.0,"Ok, I'll give 2 stars because they taste ok and are convenient.But don't let the different bowls and labels fool you!Over half of the 60 cups are corn flakes.Corn flakes are boring and leave me starving!Smart Start and Healthy Heart are really good cereals, full of protein and fiber.They only have a few of those in the box.Rasin Bran is ok, flakes but with raisins.Special K, Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, and Rice Crispies HAVE NOTHING.You might as well drink the milk and throw out the cereal.I'm hungry in minuites if not seconds after eating those darn flakes.Stay away from this assortment and try the others.I prefer the ""Wellness Assortment.""They are a lot more filling and provide more energy.The ""Wellness Assortment"" keeps me happy until lunch time.The ""Family Assortment"" just keeps me hungry."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,Buy more and stack higher if you need the capacity. Takes up less counter space this way. Sturdy and well designed. Comes with extender feet so you can have short or tall levels when stacking. Easily unstacks for ease of loading bottle parts.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I was hesitant to buy this tea, since all of the Lipton brand teas I have tried have a musty taste and odor to me. But the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea (my two favorite fruits) was irrisitable to me. I am so glad I gave it a try. The scent was incredible and the taste just as good. With a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea I have ever had."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"The Blue light is the only thing that has helped me have a normal life for the last two years. I used the bright lites starting in 1996 and they helped a bit but nothing like this device.I went to the sites described by some reviewers here. These sites do expound that this blue light may affect AMD. This includes the bright lights and also the sun - it is not limited to this device. To get the same therapeutic affect with the bright lights and the sun I would need several hours more a day so the total blue light would be the same. I read Rosenthal's new book and I do not believe he checked into the lights much as he dismisses them off-hand.I have no choice but to use the blue light. Before I bought mine I suffered suicidal depression, an inability to have coherent speech, and a affect on my body where the slightest effort was not worth it. The bright lights diminished this affect but the blue light eliminated it, except for a bit of lethargy in the dark winters.There are many medications out there that cause complications if the user is not carefull and maybe the blue light is one of them. Even the medication alternatives to light therapy cause problems. I can not go back to the way I felt prior to this product and will not. I will limit my light time to 30 minutes as recommended by the manufacturer. This is after all a medical device and as such should only be used by people who suffer S.A.D.A note"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,I am very happy with this product. The instructions where sent beforehand by e-mail and I have printed them out to keep with my sticks. The price of this package is incredible compared to what you would pay in the shops. Until now they seem to have worked fine. Once when my period was late I doubted the negative result of the pregnancy sticks. I tested with an 'answer' shop bought pregnancy test which was the same price as this whole package for only 2 sticks and the result was exactly the same.I would definitely recommend this product.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"These bars rock! I've been trying to convince my hubby for awhile to switch over from Clif Builders bars to something more natural and raw as his daily protein bar. This has finally done the trick! Bars taste great, great source of protein and are healthy! Thank you Raw Revolution!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Great taste! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma, does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste.The reason why your(to the previous reviewer) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine.If you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer.These are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,These are great especially if you are one that does not eat a lot of fiber. No messy powders. Just pop two a day in your mouth and your set! You can't beat the price for two bottles! If you go to the store you will pay a lot more!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Not only will this product make you more attractive to the opposite sex, but it will give you the fresh breath and energy to take advantage of that attraction.Huzzah for Penguin Mints! Double Huzzah!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"As a massage therapist wanting to be able to do massage or facials on this table. I thought the table would be great. When I got the table, I noticed it was a very hard table definatly not a 3"" padding as stated and not as comfortable as other massage tables, it was also not as wide. I also had the same feed back from others. The cables also got in the way everytime I would try and put it away, it was very tricky to put away with out the cables getting in the way. I had decided it wasn't good enough for my clients and had to return it."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"Item worked well at first.We planned well in advance so by the time this really got used the 90 day warranty had expired. After less than a month of regular usage the pump motor started to go bad, now it hardly pumps at all and when it does the motor really labors.Kind of a pisser when a $140 item turns out to be a lemon.One star because it DID work well at first."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Absolute waste of money, this is not a Pillow as advertised, in my opinion falsely, but a flat mat which, when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this. You could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all. An extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution. Now out of pocket and no better off."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I am currently undergoing physical therapy for knee pain and I end every session with 20 minutes of icing with the Elasto-Gel. I currently do the frozen veggies bag trick at home and it is not nearly as efficient as the Elasto-Gel. I'll be purchasing one in the near future most definitely.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"sure after the first one or two it's ok, but after a while, there's not much texture too it, the tastes meld together, it gets bland,.....I still have most o fthe box left if anyone wants them....."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,It works. Everybody at work comes and asks me for this tea when their stomach is upset or when they eat too much or have gas. Also it has a nice sweet taste. No sugar required.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"People seem to love or hate the Raw Revolution bars. They have a different taste and texture. They're uncooked, after all! I think they're very tasty and filling. I gave the Hazelnut and Chocolate bars only 4 stars because I thought they were a bit doughy (uncooked!)and had a somewhat sweet/sour taste. Overall, I liked them a lot. They're excellent for people who want to avoid gluten and diary!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Like a massage therapist in your own home.. this is the exact same product Discovery store sells- made by homedics- same exact model. Feels great but wish the rollers moved a bit faster. I bought one for me & one for a friend who just had a baby..instead of more baby stuff, a massage chair for mom for her tired back -while the baby's sleeping mom can really relax!(the best baby gift she ever got she said) It really works out those knots in your back."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,These cereal bars are delicious. I've tried 3 flavors and they've all been wonderful. They make a good quick breafast if you don't have time for a bowl of cereal.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I've been using this pump for the past several months and have been happy with it only because I have nothing to compare it too. I do agaree with everything the prior review said for Pro's and Con's. I do like the petals since without them my nipple gets sucked all the way inside. If the suction is too hard it does become painful but then you can just decrease the suction. I found that at the end of each pumping session I have to massage each breast while the pump is active to get all my milk out though. I'm not sure if this is due to the pump or maybe my breasts are not fitting in the petals/cup correctly. It just prolongs my pumping time.I can deal with all that but I would say the biggest draw back for me is the freezer storage system. I work over an hour from home and are gone for over 10.5 hours. The freezer gel packs last a maximum of 6 hours - I've experimented with this including putting the entire themal bag in the freezer but that didn't lengthen the time. Since the thermal bags are such an odd vertical shape, I can't find any regular liquid freezer packs that are small enough to fit inside the bags. My job offeres a lactation room which has a small refigerator - thank goodness for that -but I'm still going to have a major problem in the summer when I have to travel home in the hot weather and when I have to travel to remote locations. The small gell packs are a major pain since there are so many of them.I can rearrange the parts in the center of the bag so that I have a small horizontal space to fit a different thermal bag. Right now I'm searching for a small bag like that which will fit inside this space and which I can use liquid freezer packs plus fit 2+ 9oz bottles inside - so we'll see. I contacted Avent about this and they offer nothing else.I also need a car adaptor which they currently do not provide but said they were working on it. They have no battery available.Before I purchased this pump I did research between Medella and Avent and thought both were comparable but the real quirks don't become apparent until you start using it!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Item as described and received in a timely manner... an excellent buying experience!
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,A little narrow so the amrs feel crowed on the larger customers . And by all means do not kneel on the arm support under the head rest as i did acidentily as the tigs that hold it on will snap like dry spagetti. LOl The product was very adiquait and well put together other than the arm rest which I have not fortified and it holds nicely. Weight and portability are good so a thumbs up from me!
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,The sound of it working is great ambient noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell wonderful! It does a reasonable job of humidification in my medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it. And it doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run for several hours. The light show and the aromatherapy can be quite a nice mood setter romantically as well.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"I am a person who take good care of my health by eating good things. By now, I am very concerning what food should be included in our diets to maintain good health. Especially, high calories food based on carb make me worried about my diet. BUT! Since I tried this product, which is real good, I stop worrying to eat RICE. It's real low calories, healthy organic brown rice, not expensive, and easy to cook (just only 1min. 30sec. in the micro.). Anyway, I really enjoy this product, and of course buy again."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"I got a pack of these for free with my last order! Thanks Pier Mall! Very tasty cookie cracker snack, with a light touch of honey flavor. My friends liked it too. I will definitely buy some with my next order."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,I bought the Dreamfields Penne pasta and Victoria's Vodka Sauce (only 4 carbs per cup of sauce in any grocery store). I got to stay on my low-carb diet without cheating at all and have Penne a la Vodka for under 10 carbs. How great is that?!
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,5.0,"Light cheesy crunch with none of that nasty orange coloring. We love them and always get them at Trader Joe's, but amazon had them for less"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"It is very easy to put it in your hot cereal or in a milk shake, and the flavor is malty, not bad at all, I include a tsp. of Maca powder and 4 tsps. of Flax powder together, it only makes the cereal or shake better tasting and more filling. Enjoy!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"Our daughter swears by them. When she needs a quick lift between classes at college, during a study session, or can't get to a meal yet, she grabs a luna bar. As she is a chocoholic, any of them with chocolate will do, but she really likes the chocolate pecan."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've had difficulty falling asleep since my college days. Once I entered my mid-30's the insomnia became more frequent. Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect. L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, and GABA were ineffective. I have also tried numerous prescription (sleep is necessary to get through nursing school) and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia. Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness (zombie mode). I first tried Sleepytime Extra (Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me)about 6 weeks ago, and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes. Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm! The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella. I'm stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava. I also recommend 30-60 minutes of sunlight in a.m. hours, because many people are unaware that they have DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia)."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"My daughter bought this massager for me for Christmas and I know she spent a lot of money, even with the 20% off at Linens and Things. That is why I hesitate to tell her that it stopped working. I didn't use it much, first of all because it is so thick that when you place it on my computer chair it leaves little room for you to sit. You feel like you're falling off or just sitting on the edge. I had to move it to the couch because my son and husband kept complaining they can't sit back in the seat. The remote kept falling out of its pocket which may have contributed to it acting up and eventually stopped working altogether. First it was not doing the choices you pressed, then not shutting off when I pressed off (I had to unplug it). I don't know what the blue light is all about. It just shows us now that it's getting power, so we assume the remote is not working. My son, who loves taking things apart and fixing them was not able to fix it. The massage itself left bruises the first time I used it. I had to be more selective of the massage I chose or not lean back too much. I don't know what to do with it now because I didn't keep the box as I usually do for a while in case this happens."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"This was spicier than what I usually prefer. Good change of pace in my salads, but I prefer the Broccoli sprouts."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Only those who have suffered from canker sores would know the pain and trauma associated with these sores. I get canker sores that last approximately 14 days. Pain! I found Canker Cover after searching the net for relief.A few minutes after application of Canker cover on a full blown sore, my pain was gone. Three days later the sore had disappeared completely.Canker Cover is a medical breakthrough which deserves a Nobel Prize!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"We enjoyed this mix. Read about it in ""Consumer Reports."" It does require almost constant stirring after the noodles are added, however, it's worth it. It is also good the next day. We added celery and onions and chicken to it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"First, Yuban is my favorite coffee. To be able to buy a case and save is great. The coffee was in date, the seals on the cans were excellent, and the freshness of the coffee was excellent. I will definitely buy more Yuban coffee when I need it from Amazon groceries."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"It's a great idea but it doesn't work. I bought it and tried it after a small glass of beer. It turned green, meaning there was alcohol in my breastmilk. Astonished by the result, I put some water on a different strip and got the same result."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,1.0,"I bought two of these and saw no results what so ever, I actually lost weight. The mix has a hard time totally dissolving so you will routinely drink big clumps of powder. Also the mix does not last long because they have you using one big scoop per serving. The scoop is one cup I believe. I recently bought GMC brand of whey protein and there is no comparison. GMC's stuff actually tastes good and I don't mind drinking it. Anyways you get what you pay for."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I bought it for my daughter and the only complaint I had is that one of the ties was broken. but it was easy to fix and now works great! She loves the fact that it reaches the table. It was also great because it was weighted for her, some seats I found were only weighted to 30lbs and at three years old she is over that. She likes the colors and the pocka dots. It was a great buy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"These arrived nice and fresh, but even though I'm a real salt lover, they have too much salt on them for my taste. I suppose I could put them in a strainer and shake them. But it would be better - and for many people salt is a health concern - if they weren't over-salted.The packages have a notice on them that suggests refrigerating or freezing. That is good thinking. Anything with high natural fat content can easily become rancid over time, especially at higher temperatures. So when buying the small case of these things, it's wise to keep in mind your storage capabilities."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've suffered from chronic constipation for years. Laxatives and Stool softeners never really provided me with the relief I needed, only cramps. When I first came across OxyPowder, I was skeptical. I didn't think that it would work as well as it was hyped on their website. I was wrong.After the cleanse, I felt soooooo much better. It's the only colon cleanser that I've found that has provided me with continual relief. I've recommended it to my friends and family and they have all had success with it too.Highly Recommended!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:Calories"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This cushion is awesome. As a big muscular guy (6'2"" 260 lbs), I had never found a massager that was powerful enough to be effective. My muscles have met their match. It's very powerful and has enough settings and options to fix all of my aches and pains. This is a great product and I recommend it unconditionally."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"This bar is full of good nutrients; However, it is really a lot of work to consume one. You need a lot of water or milk. The taste is not that great. The only advantage is convenience when you are driving a long distance and you don't have an easy access to a quality high protein meal."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"My wife hates hot food, but for some reason, loves hot fries. If her salsa has the tiniest spice, she won't eat it, yet these mouth-burning beasts are her favorite snack. They are sometimes hard to find - having them by the case helps solve that problem. The size offered here is the size that you will normally find (around here at least) printed with the 99c price, so you can also figure the price savings, somewhere around, what, 40%? Wow!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,well one of the best you just have to have a copy of this.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"These bottles are great! My breastfed baby took to them very easily, and now that she's older, the 4oz size makes a very good container to put cereal and other solid foods in (with the sealing discs). A benefit to these bottles is their ability to effectively and easily reduce the amount of air the baby swallows. As she is drinking from the bottle, you can actually see the air bubbles being released into the bottle in between sucks.In response to other posts about the bottles leaking, we have only used these bottles, and they have never leaked (even with mommy hurrying to pack bottles when running late). I have even dropped a bottle full of milk on the floor (several times), no leaks!I love that you can interchange the nipples and sealing discs, so I can have bottles or storage containers, depending on what I need! I also bought the Avent Breastpump Conversion kit ($9), so I can use my Medela pump to pump directly into the Avent bottles.All the bottle parts are dishwasher-safe, but I choose to clean the nipples myself with a nipple brush, just to be thorough. The rings, sealing discs, caps, and bottles themselves clean up very well in the dishwasher.These bottles are durable! Like I said, I have dropped them on the floor, pumped into them, run them through the dishwasher, sterilized them, boiled them (before I had a sterilizer), and they don't show any signs of wear at all! The bottles themselves are a very hard plastic, which can go through several babies without any problems. The nipples are a softer silicone, but are thick enough that they hold up great too."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,4.0,they are high quality mints that are different from the rest with a good variety but a lil expensive is all.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,this one has a lot of vibrations and is really very heavy...if ur a petite girl like me u might want to have someone else hold it for u..i really was expecting something similar to a shiatsu massager ..should have known better...the heat like evryone says is not that bad really...it does heat up fast enough...but its the surface area of the massager that is not as big and continous as a heat pad..anyways..i would still prefer the shiatsu massagers to this one...but i guess thats me.thanksvidhya
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,2.0,"While on the whole, the Tuscan Milk experience can be described as ""mildly pleasant"", I found that it failed the most important category of all... Compatibility with chocolate syrup. Indeed, the density of Tuscan Whole Milk is so severe that Hershey's Chocolate Syrup (and 95% of store brand equivalents) does not actually blend with the milk, but instead floats at the top no matter how hard you stir. And if you should be so foolish as to consider powdered Nesquik, you will find that the chocolate flavored granules in fact hover above the surface of the milk and create a choking cloud of air-passage clogging brown particulate.Were this Tuscan Whole Milk's only transgression, it might have earned it 3 stars, rather than 2. Unfortunately, the extraordinary density also affects the consumption of cereal. Captain Crunch for instance not only ""stays crunchy"", but it also never actually gets ""wet"". This is simply unforgiveable.For those interested, I would recommend drinking it plain... out of a sturdy glass."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me. Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage. Most of my Korean colleagues love it. It is a kind of cultural icon. Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for. My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador. Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer. Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural. I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons. Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable. You must try some."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I used Avent with my two older kids and was very excited when I heard they were coming out with a disposable system which worked with the bottles (the old system had color coded nipples that you had to match to the nurser or bottle and they weren't interchangeable.)The biggest selling points of this new system is that if you are already using avent bottles or were planning on it you can add these nursers without keeping two sets of nipples. Everything that you love about the Avent bottles holds true with the nursers. You can pump directly into them and that's a big plus.Here are the major drawbacks:1. The nurser base is very wide. I have small hands and found the nursers to be very cumbersome and they didn't feel natural to hold during feedings. The nursers are a lot wider than the bottles, if you've used the old version of the nursers you'll also notice how much larger this new design is. My husband who has much larger hands than me said that he liked the wider bottle and it didn't seems as easy to drop and felt more natural to him.2. You can't use other brands of liners. I pump & store my milk, and I've found that the bags are just TOO narrow to fit this bottle (Playtex & Lansinoh). You are either going to have to pump directly into this liner or you'll have to transfer milk (which for me defeated the whole point, since I use Lansinoh to store milk flat in the freezer!)3. This bottle won't take the Playtex Drop Ins either, they are MUCH smaller than the Avent brand. If you can't find the Avent liners easily in your area you'll be stuck ordering online.All in all, I think this is a good product if you are willing to deal with the issues I've stated. I used Avent with my older children and I SWEAR by their system however this product just wasn't for me. For all of the trouble I had with it, it just made more sense in my situation not to use them.For now I will keep using my Avent bottles. I might try the Playtex disposable system however I have learned that their system doesn't have as many silicone nipple options as Avent (Playtex currently makes"

What a racket. The cup is $1.74 at Walmart but the spout is $1.75 on ebay. Might as well get a new cup. Lame!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"These are so yummy. My son likes the Oat Bran, hubby likes the Honey Wheat and I love the Pumpernickel & Onion. It makes me happy to find an incredible ingredient list for something so yummy. Amazon has the best price if you want to buy in bulk."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This stuff is amazing-it not only tastes exactly like sugar it looks like sugar. This is the only substitute sugar my husband has not detected. We have had it in our sugar bowl for five months and he still thinks it is sugar!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I love this tea. I prefer to drink it at nights prior to bedtime as I find the aroma relaxing and gentle. Nice tea!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I love the chillow. It works really well. I was worried it might leak but I have had mine for two years and it's never leaked. You have to open it occasionally and let the sponge inside unbunch but other than that it is great.It keeps your head cool for at least an hour and you can flip it over or move it around to keep it cool longer.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Since I have started to use this product over a year ago, I don't even try to find other brands. I will stick with this brand of ex. virg. coconut oil for as long as I can get it. I take at least two tbls. of this throughout the day and I use it on every food that I eat instead of butter. This is one of the top natural cures that you can buy and it is simply a FOOD!!"
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,My co-workers and I in my hospital unit all think the crusher works just fine and we like the grip you can get on the top because it isn't justround. Only drawback is that the base edges are kind of sharp as most of us hold it in our hands while we are crushing meds.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"I love yogi teas, however I have to admit that this one tasted a little bit too sweet from the stevia. I dont mean sweet in the good way....It gave a weird after taste and i really didnt enjoy it. However this is just my taste preference. If you dont mind an overwhelming stevia sweetness than this tea would be fine."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Muscle milk in general is really good! The chocolate milk (not naturals) was a little better. This one didn't mix as well, it was a little clumpy even though I used a shaker. I'd recomend the not-naturals kind but they're all good."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"Is this a black tea? Or a tisane? There's so little darjeeling that I wonder why bother putting it in at all. As well, the darjeeling is overpowered by all the other ingredients, so why not use a less delicately flavored black tea. As for the berries, well, the hibiscus overpowers those elements, so why not cut out the hibiscus altogether? I was disappointed, only because I like a full bodied cup of black tea, and didn't get it. I believe Numi offers an all-berry tea, and I would recomment that."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have used this stuff for a few years, mostly for bruises, but when I broke my big toe it really seemd to help it heal very quickly,not just clearing the blood under the nail, (which I didn't loose), but helped with the pain. It also seemed to help with a case of tendonitis I had in my ankle. Its non greasy. It works so well that when my 8 yr old smashed his finger while working he wouldn't let me put it on because he didn't want it to make his ""trophy"" go away before his buddies could see it!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,I love this Garlic Seasoning and could only find it at Samms Club (which I no longer belong to) I looked everywhere and finally found it on Amazon.com. This is fabulous on anything and what's very important to me is that it has No Salt or MSG.! I received it very quickly and will be back for more. This blend of Garlic and Herbs is excellent!

grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"I think that some people have complained that this popcorn is bland, but that's what it's supposed to be.... It's a product that is as healthy as you want it to be- you decide. :) Although I do like to add salt, I have found that I don't really care to add a lot of other flavors to it. This is probably because my mom used to air-pop popcorn when we were kids (and add her own flavors) and it kind of reminds me of that. I guess she didn't add very much. :) It seems to ""pop"" better than other varieties I've tried and it doesn't leave you with greasy fingers. Good job, Newman."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I bought this to get my kids started on an Omega-3 supplement and it's a great idea; however, while it's probably the best option you have for kids, it does not taste good. It has an unpleasant orange taste, certainly OK enough for an adult, and maybe for some kids, but for many kids I think you will have a battle. My daughter will take it mixed in some chocolate yogurt but she's a really good sport. My son HATES it in every combination I've tried so far. It is very hard to mask the dominant orange taste. I am trying it today in a couple of tablespoons of raspberry sorbet and see if that will fly--it might as the supersweet flavor of the sorbet goes a long way to mellowing the orange. Bottom line"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"When I ordered this Flax Oil, I really should have read closer, I went for price, not quality. I should have looked at the serving size, which in this bottle of 120 caps is only 17, meaning you have take 7 of these huge pills a day to get the amounts advertised. I won't be buying this one again."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"Although designed for high-protein, low-carb diets these bars are a nutritional powerhouse featuring many essential vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in generous amounts. At around 270 calories per bar you get a complete meal replacement which satisfies your hunger while being very tasty. Highly recommended."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,I got these drinks as well as some other Hawaiian Sun assortment from my aunt who got them straight from Hawaii and fell in love. these juices are my favorite type of juice. They're addicting good and with ice they make the ultimate smoothie and I'm sure with or without ice it'd be a great cocktail mixer. Try all the Hawaiian Sun drinks before you choose your favorite. This happens to be mine
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These vanilla protein pills tast great. I can eat the protein pills while at work which helps take me through to my lunch. I just pop three pills, one at a time, in my mouth while working. It's not at all like trying to eat a protein bar while working, which of course you can't do. They tast good and are soft and desolve in my mouth quickly. Very nice, especially if my lunch is running late and I don't have to stop at three pills either."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,My husband discovered Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey tea when visiting the Celestial Seasonngs company in Colorado. He sampled it there and and loved the flavor. We were able to purchase this tea in our city (Chicago) when we returned from our trip.

health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,"This product probably works really well but I just couldn't keep using it because it comes off in the shower and you have to keep each patch on for 3 days, take it off, wash it everyday, let it dry and then put it back on. Some people are good at stuff like this but I feel it's tedious and too easy to forget a step when you lead a busy life."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"One of my favorite Clif Bars that I've tried. I love them for a breakfast bar because you can eat them and not feel hungry for quite a while. The banana nut bread is like taking the lesser healthy version, and compacting it down to a little chewy bar. They do a good job matching a flavor with a bar; unlike some other flavors where it tastes like lemon flavored granola or some odd mismatch. Good all around pick."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This stool is ideal for a budget which is deserving of the four stars. It also seems sturdy and not squeeky as one review had noted. The quality is not exquisit but that was to be expected. It seems durable enough for what I need it for as far as my massage practice. The upolstery is good but a little loose so the foam which is almost too soft/smushy is out of wack when I get up from the stool, which may pose a problem with extended use. We'll see."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,I have to agree with the reviews of the other users here. This stuff makes you feel like you're on crazy pills. I had a sick feeling in my throat minutes after taking them. I highly recommend Lean System 7 as a safe alternative to this.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,5.0,Great tasting! The kids loved them. We love the all natural ingredients. Very difficult to find quality and a truley natural product these days. We even order them a work for the staff.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"These terry pillow protectors are soft and comfortable, unlike most waterproof protectors. They are well made and zip closed. They are even softer after being machine washed."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"This is great for a gluten, corn, soy and casein free cheesy cracker. The orange color and spice mix really fools you into thinking you're eating a cheddar flavored cracker. This is our replacement for goldfish crackers and cheesy chex mix."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"This is a delicious choice for breakfast. I thought it wouldn't hold me from hunger for long because it was flakes, but it really does a good job! It stays crunchy considerably well, and has just the right sweetness. Tastes healthy, but not in a gross way :0) You feel like you are making a good decision to eat it. Definitely worth it, because of the volume of cereal you get!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"I love Meyenberg's fresh goat milk, but this canned milk has a bit of a goaty taste--still it's ok. Raw goat's milk where the nannies have been separated from the billies tastes better than cow's milk!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,I've never understood the appeal of the $300 changing table when changing pads like these are available instead. This changing pad can be used anywhere and is easily folded up and secured with the use of a velcro strap. The pattern is attractive and the pad can be machine washed. We're very pleased with this purchase.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"This is perfect. I had bought a high chair that I was not very pleased with due to inferior quality, but when I added this little pink gingham cover, it really looked nice. It added the charm I was looking to spruce up the high chair."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,This is the hottest Chili paste you will ever find. Just 1 Tsp. Heated up a cassarole nicely. Add more or less to taste of this product or just add it at the table. You will love it.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I use this pump all the time- for 95% of my baby's feedings. I actually have 2 of them. I keep one in the car with a clean bottle at all times and one in the house. The pump is easy to clean, and comes with spare parts. This manual pump is comfortable to use. I know that all of the experts recommend electric pumps, but I have done just fine using this manual pump and saved a ton of money over the electric pumps. The Avent bottles fit directly only this pump, so it's quick and simple to take the full bottle off the pump and either freeze it with a sealing disc, feed your baby by putting on a nipple top, or store it in the fridge with a nipple top & storage cap. I must note however that 1 of my pumps is the older version of this model and the other is the newest version. The newest and current version leaks a little where the screw on grooves from the pump meet the bottle, as the older version with a different part did not. So, just be a bit careful when using this otherwise you'll have drops of milk on your clothes!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"My friend is a recent mom, and she is so busy sometimes she has no time to clean bottles. Did her a favor and got her a pack, but you can still go through these on one day."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,5.0,"I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity. I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection. You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent. This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities. You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned. My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD ""It just sounds more alive""---she says. This water is highly recommended for this purpose. I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"I try to be good, but when I feel like indulging in some delicious, gourmet potato chips, these New York Chedder potato chips are the first flavor I like to go for, when I see them at the natural food store. The chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand."
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"This is a terrible product and a horrible company. Delivery was very slow and inserts were intolerable. I promptly returned product, but did not receive refund, despite many phone calls.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products. This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!It is moderately spicy, but if you don't mind a bit if spice, this one is just too good to pass up. I could practically live off of this stuff!Thank you, Annie Chun, for making a packaged meal worth eating!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"This was an excellent buy! My 6 month old sat right in it and LOVED it, she felt like a grown up joining us at meal times. It's adjustable, easy to feed her from, easy to wash (dishwasher safe trays), easy to fold and take with you to restaurants etc! My best friend saw mine and is now wishing she got one of these instead of her much more expensive high chair!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"Trimspa works great if you take it consistantly. I have to take about 4 to 6 tablets every day. I start with a few more per day initially and then after a few days I can cut it back a couple. If I take it as directed, I discover that after about 2 days I cannot eat nearly as much food without feeling pretty darn full. It isn't that I don't ever get hungry its just that when I do sit down to eat, the amount I feel full after eating is cut about in half. Then I don't feel the need to eat until the next meal. It helps kill snacking and overeating for me, which makes it great in conjunction with any type of modified eating program that you are trying to stick to. It does not make me feel jittery or weird. The biggest issue is just remember to take the pills 3 times a day and it does tend to work a little better if you can take it about an hour before each meal. I have discovered that I cannot lose more than about 12 pounds through just dietary changes so I have starting adding exercise to my program and the trimspa is helping tremendously, because usually when I start working out my appetite goes right up. I believe these are a great assist to any weight loss program you are trying to stick with."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,The product order went smoothly and it arrived soon. I was very happy with the order.This product tastes wonderful with the subtle vanilla flavor. I put it in a blender vegetable drink with nuts or seeds. The goat product seems easier for my system to handle than cow products and I like that it's organic.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,"I found this mix at the Ft Myer Commissary. I looked for this product last time I visited the commissary and could not find it. So here I am online looking and found it here. I could eat this all day. I've tried several different snack mixes, but most have too many pretzels. This has a very nice balance of flavors and textures -- and not a lot of pretzels. I'm stocking up!!"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"I bought this for our first long trip with the baby. It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru. It would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough, and she is not that patient (neither are most babies, for that matter)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,4.0,I really enjoyed these Lightful beverages. Buying them on Amazon saved me some cash too. I really liked Strawberry the best. Blend it it with some frozen strawberries and banana and BAM! you have an instant smmothie. The chocolate was really good with a banana and some peanut butter. The vanilla is great with everything else. They are best served cold. If you are on WW these are totally awesone 1 point snack!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good. I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products. I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable. Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"this product is the best tea I have ever tasted...it's almost impossible to find here in California, but I used to buy it in NY all the time. I'm so glad I was able to find it here."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I like that they are all natural. They don't make me feel sick like ALL the other major brands that I have tried. I first bought them at the local health food store and paid way too much there. This is a good price for a FANTASTIC product.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Excellent buy! Much cheaper than I can purchase in the store. A very flavorful tea. The aroma of the tea has many people at work asking me what I am drinking.
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"I was shocked when i read the negative comments about this thermometer. We selected this as a replacement for our ear thermometer on the recommendation of our pediatrian. Apparently, if you don't angle the ear thermometer just right, you will get false readings. Whereas this thermometer measures the temperature in a more correct and accurate manner. When my kids were sick with the flu, I was able to determine their temperature without any fighting to hold a basal thermometer under the tongue, stick something in their ear or make them hold still for under arm, etc. Just one swipe across the forehead and an accurate reading. FANTASTIC! Anything that keeps my children comfortable when they are feeling so bad already is well worth the price. My advice would be to talk to your child's pediatrician about it to see if it's the right choice for your family. Chances are they are already using it in the office like ours is, and you can test it out before deciding to purchase it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,this thing is perfect! comes with an a/c adaptor as well as a car adaptor!
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"The Exergen has to be the best baby product invented. Ever been awake wondering how high your feverish sleeping child's temp is but afraid to wake her checking? No problem!The ONLY complaint (which still doesn't prevent me from giving this product a 5 rating) is that there is no backlight. You have to move to a lit area in the dark to read the result. Also, when first using, it is best to test your scanner when there is no fever. I find that 98.6 is not always a consistent baseline. Learn each person's base temp before the fever begins.IMPORTANT - if the patient has a hot forehead due to sunburn and you suspect a fever developing, use another non-forehead means to double check. We gave our child fever-reducing medicine only to realize the ""sunstroke fever"" turned out to be heat from sunburn on the skin itself. Apply some aloe vera, wait, and then check when the skin has had a chance to recover a bit. Double check with alternate thermometer.Of course, I also find that the ""lip test"" is great too. An old pro taught it to me. If you touch your lips to your child's forehead, you can easily tell if the heat you felt with your hand is fever or just a warm body. I can almost as accurately predict the temperature with the lip test, but always use my Exergen forehead scan to confirm. :)"

health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"I am a Medial Doctor. I have familiarity with many types of thermometers. While the newest fad is temporal artery thermometers, some work well and some don't. This one DOES NOT. It is very inaccurate, not even close. So what else do you need to know. A thermometer which doesn't measure temperature accurately is worthless. Here are some examples of some repeated measurements on the same person"
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,5.0,"I think these pacifiers are great; they work either way so at night you don't have to feel around for a notch to make sure they're going in the right direction. They don't leave marks around my baby's mouth like another pacifier did. I believe the company is European, maybe that's why they're not as widespread in the U.S., but they're made well. The attachment is so useful, especially when you're out and about with the baby. Just imagine the horror when the pacifier drops out of the baby's mouth onto the germ-filled floor and there's no bathroom in sight to wash the pacifier."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Not only does it take less time, but you don't have the problem of the crushed pearls you often find in the standard packages. (When they dry out, some crackle and fall apart, which means you end up cooking not only the intact ones, but also the powdery stuff that ends up forming a goo in your hot water; also, some break in the process of cooking with the normal kind.) Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, I would suggest buying the minute kind."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"we love this massager! wife recently came out of surgery and this has been getting used everyday to work out the kinks and knots. A few minutes in an isolated spot and tension is gone. Unwieldy?? too big?? c'mon give me a break, my 4 year olds can handle it, my dog loves to get her massage..a great gift!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,This is the second protein shake I've tried since I started working out. My first was GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein. ON Gold Standard is a lot better in my opinion because of the taste and it is absorbed faster. I used this for about 2 months and noticed more lean muscle. I recommend double rich chocolate. The next protein I'm trying is Isopure Low Carb.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"I already have the Medela Harmony but I got the Pump in Style Advanced to increase my milk supply and to maintain it when I go back to work. It does is job, but I don't like the noise it makes, making me rethink pumping where I could be overheard, and the battery pack, which ought to be a rechargeable lithium battery, uses a large handful of AAs instead- which according to the manual, allow for 10 to 12 pumping sessions - pretty expensive to replace so many batteries (ten), and where do you get a charger for that many rechargeable batteries. To me, it's stupid and a big disadvantage, because I might not have access to a private space WITH an electrical outlet at work. Also, it's very unwieldy, to hold two bottles and adjust the speed- although they dio have a hands free kit which I don't have. It's faster than single pumping, and less wear and tear on your hands, but I perceive that it pumps about the same quantity for me as the Harmony does. They should also include nipples with the four bottles they include."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Mona's Granola is the best granola that I have ever eaten. It is wonderful and tastes great in vanilla yogurt. For a special treat I add M & M's. I have even made cookies with it and they are great! I got the recipe from Mona, herself! Try Mona's Granola I am sure that you'll love it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"I've purchased other products from Interactive Health, including the iJoy (which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I've tried), and their Ottoman 2.0 (which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully).I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products, but have been disappointed. The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well, but doesn't hit the back of my neck at all--and that's where my sore spot always tends to be at! The ""pillow"" itself is hard and can be uncomfortable, so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price. However, should you find this massager on sale, it's a decent product. I'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager, though..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Plain and simple, these Builder's Bars are one of the best tasting protein bars you can get. They are crispy and chewy at the same time and they aren't super sweet like a candy bar. And at 2.4 ounces a piece they are large enough and filling enough to be a meal replacement.And the one thing that I really like is that when I read the ingredients, I actually know what the stuff is! Nothing weird or unnatural, just real ingredients!Out of the four flavors available (Chocolate Mint, Peanut Butter, Chocolate, Cookies `n Cream) I prefer the Chocolate Mint and Peanut Butter, mainly because they taste even less like a protein bar. I'm not saying the plain Chocolate and Cookies 'n Cream are bad tasting, just that I prefer the taste of the Chocolate Mint and Peanut Butter ones (they are all really tasty).These are just awesome, 100% natural, high protein, real ingredients, and they taste great! I just love them!A bit of product info:Vanilla Almond"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Haha.. cheesy title.. but it really is quite a product.I have been using NO-Xplode by BSN for months now. Along with my iPod it has been one of the main factors in me losing over 55 lbs and at least 30 of that was pure fat! Do the research people.. you will find that the fat burning qualities of this product aren't the only benefit. The 'pump' you get is only the beginning. The blend that is within the product allows for sustained workout times, faster recovery and healing of worked outmuscles, higher reps for weight training and even longer cardio sessions.. if you are doing that.. and you always should be.It has become one of the base supplements that I have added to my routine. As always, you should do the research on anything before you jump into adding it to your body, and with teh internet.. that is NOT a difficult thing to do correctly. Along withBSN Syntha-6 Ultra-Premium Sustained Release Protein Powder, Chocolate Milkshake, 46.56 Ouncesand things like 100% Whey Protein - Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate 5.15 lbs.. andUltimate Nutrition Arginine Pyroglutamate, 750 mg, 100 Capsules (Pack of 2)I am looking and feeling better than I was 10 years ago at 21.Doooo it!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,4.0,"These are similar to energy gels, but in bite size chunks. The only complaint I have is how much room they take up in my pack or pockets. Still, I like the fact that they provide more level energy than gels without being all yucky on my hands and face. However, this is the only good flavor. The rest are pretty yucky."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"These chips are AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Seriously, it's like you are eating chips and salsa. The flavor is very ""complex"" (if you can say that about a chip), and the chips are very light and crispy. If you like Doritos, you will be BLOWN AWAY by these!"

My son tore the plastic at the opening of the valve just from sucking on it. So not only did it spill everywhere but he also endned up getting to much fluid and either began to choke or wore what he was drinking. But they are great when you are switching over from a bottle and when they are teething."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,cocktail mixers,5.0,"This product is great! I am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in Hollywood, CA and I was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives. It's a huge waste of time, and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately. Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Let's face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it?"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"My wife bought this stuff when she was down in New Orleans recently and brought it home for my birthday dinner this last weekend.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"Luna bars are delicious and filling. They come in a variety of flavors. Plus, at 180 calories each, they shave a few calories off of the other bars of this type without sacrificing flavor or size.The texture tends to be granola/krispie crunch with a flavored thin layer of frosting. If you like a more creamy filling, these bars probably aren't for you. If you enjoy crunch and substance though, they're a great alternative to other meal replacement bars.My favorites are S'Mores and Lemon Zest flavors. I do like that Luna puts out some flavors besides pure chocolate bar or chocolate peanut butter. I've replaced my previous morning SlimFast Optima bar with a Luna bar, and the variety of delicious flavors keeps me much more satisfied than the SF bars did."

That is because there was NO picture when I bought this item and NOWHERE did it indicate that there was a price on it. When it arrived, all of the little packs are marked 30 cents! Now I have to stock my entire concession stand with nickels and dimes and all of a sudden the flunkies I have working for me are going to have to count out real change and do real math to sell the merchandise when I had everything in multiples of a quarter. I had actually planned to sell these for 50 cents, because people expect a certain markup, but they ARE very small. They are good, and my ballplayers literally demand them, but I can't wait until they sell out. Personally, I think if you sell pre-priced merchandise, you should so indicate."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I love this High Chair! I have been looking at it since I was pregnant because of the lack of extra space in my home. After reading tons of positive reviews and compairing I finally purchased it and am so glad I did. My son loves it. He's only three months old and doesn't need it for eating yet, but it is so nice to be able to put him in it while we eat our dinner. It really makes it feel like we're eating as a family. He seams to enjoy sitting with us because he smiles the whole time he's in it. He is not the best at holding his head up for long periods of time yet, so the fact that the seat reclines is great! I almost wish I could sit in it because he looks so comfortable! Great product!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This has been a really easy way to change my diet. I've been trying to switch to a more vegetarian/raw food diet.Concerning taste, a big difference is made by using only organic bananas and unwaxed apples (which is what the company recommends). The organic fruit seems to mix better and makes the drink much smoother. The drink itself is actually tastes pretty good. It's sweetened with stevia and spirulina has a naturally sweet taste.Although 17 grams of protein per serving (same as an odwalla protein bar) is pretty good, I still wish there was more. It comes out to about $1.88 per serving, which isn't too bad."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"I am a former teaching fellow in Physiology and I also have additional graduate education in both biochemistry and psychology. Some of my studies included neurobiology and I have a lot of meditation experience. As part of my work, I teach meditation workshops and also use biofeedback personally and for education purposes. While I know the basics of neurofeedback, it is not a specialty area. So, using this product was a brand new experience for me. This is not biofeedback as such, but it could be coupled with biofeedback for various purposes.What this equipment does in generate patterns of light that are synchronized with sound. There are also various CDs available that couple the Proteus unit to music. I tried the system in both ways, but got the most out of coupling it with music.The glasses provided with the Proteues are meant to be used while your eyes are closed. They generate very bright light that shines through your eyelids. In EEG work, a light strobe is used in a similar fashion to induce seizures in susceptible people or for other types of study.The theoretical concept behind this type of technology is that one can induce certain brain states characterized by different amplitudes of specific types of brain waves i.e. alpha, beta, theta and delta. Different patterns of brain waves result in different mind states. The product literature also talks about the concept of entrainment where your brain waves synchronize to the light and sound while your brain hemispheres are synchronized or balanced.While I can't speak to the validity of the theory, testing, etc., I could talk about my experience. In short, it was awesome and it certainly seemed to have the ability to induce different states of consciousness including relaxation and euphoria. Because I do biofeedback work, I was curious to couple it with heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse data. In my case, I seemed to reach higher levels of brain/heart coherence. This correlates with being in a relaxed, open and healthy state. That's all you really need to know if the technical language is unfamiliar.As an aesthetic experience, using this unit was simply AWESOME! When I bought it, my expectations weren't that high. However, all of my expectations were exceeded. Because you are wearing glasses that generate the light, it completely fills your visual field. The effect is indescribable. Also, the pulsations of light induce states that are unusual and very pleasant. I found the experience fascinating and I can certainly see how this could be useful for meditation, relaxation and perhaps even pain management. I was having back pain the day I used it and I definitely had less pain afterwards. My feeling of well-being also remained after my session was over.I am a bit surprised that this device is marketed to the general public because there is the possibility that it could induce seizures in some people. The literature and the product description provide warnings that people prone to seizures and on psychotropic medications should NOT use it without consulting with their physicians.I'm guessing that the type of people who are looking at this product are probably interested in meditation, self development and our expansion of consciousness. If this is true, you may be interested inIntegral Life Practice Starter Kit. You can read my review about the details, but it provides a structure for engaging yourself in a variety of practices physical, emotional, mental and spiritual all at the same time to bring about transformation. Ken Wilber is a very reputable author and this kit is well thought out.There are many books on biofeedback and neurobiofeedback as well. For the layperson, it is difficult to know what to choose. If you are serious about this type of technology, however, I would recommendAwakening the Mind PA"

You guessed it, Wal-mart quit carrying them. This has happened to us before on other products and we've just located a substitute. There is no sub for these almonds and, thankfully, Soooo good and a healthy snack to boot!!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"High chair is reasonablly priced and my grandson loves it. Went together easily.Tray is big enough to have his food on it and yet he can not yet reach it. Better yet,when he is not eating, it also holds several of his toys . We like the way the big tray comes off to put him in the chair.Like others said, wish it had wheels and was not so bulky taking up some much space.Overall we are all happy with the chair."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"No Pudge brownies are AMAZING. They truly taste just as good as brownies with all the lovely fat in them. These are all natural, too--as in, the ingredients are few, and consist of normal things you have in your pantry. No 15+ letter chemicals here. All you need to add is 5 1/2 oz fat-free french vanilla yogurt. These brownies come out VERY chewy, so if you like yours softer, double the amount of yogurt. And check out their website for other recipe ideas!Seriously--you're not going to buy six boxes only to find out they taste like cardboard. They're FAT free, not sugar and taste free. You will want to tell everyone you know that this mix exists! Delicious!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea is really, really good -- it's very strong, but not bitter at all, very mild and smooth, with an aftertaste of honey. Even my husband likes it and he's a coffee drinker. I buy it by the case online because no stores around here carry it."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I order this by the case. My entire family enjoys Smart Puffs. My grandkids know just where the box is and, with permission, love to help themselves."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,This product is excellent because it has no artificial sweeteners and still tastes great.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Read the label. It contains the most vitamins and nutrients that I have ever seen. It mixes well with rice milk and gives me the feel good boost I have been looking for. And the price is right.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This makes unusually good bread that is bendable and chewy and a hint of sweetness probaby from the sorghum grain they use. It makes really good, ""normal"" pizza crust and flatbread too. My favorite GF mix. Also dairy free."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My wife and I started taking this product last year. I have yet to get sick or have a cold the entire time. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great diet supplement. It's worth the effort and the price.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,4.0,"This breakfast bar is an excellent meal replacement. It's really healthy. I hate making breakfast so I got these cookies thinking that even I could open a cookie package. This is a good breakfast, and a healthy one. We got the Fruit and Nut version first, and those are a little better. This one doesn't taste like peanut butter to me, so if you're expecting a cookie that tastes like a Pillsbury PB cookie, think again. But it does have peanuts in the cookie. They are very dense, and not at all like those hideous fruit filled breakfast bars you get in the store. They're soft, not crunchy. They're full of fiber and fruit, even the ones called peanut butter flavor."
health personal care,health care,women s health,3.0,When you are trying to lose weight you constantly need snacks on hand. Luna Bars are one of the best. Cookies and cream are pretty good but my favorite are the Chocolate peppermint!
health personal care,health care,unknown,4.0,"KCK Medical is a quality full service medical supply company that has great products and service. The diapers are well made and comfortable. It is necessary that you launder them before using them, in order to make the material more comfortable and absorbent. As a wheelchair user who has been incontinent since birth, I am always looking for well made and economically priced diapers, and I believe that these fill the bill. If I knew how long they would last, there is a good chance that I would give them five (5) stars. So far, they have gone through ten washings and still look new. Most likely, I will be placing another order as my other diapers continue to wear out. For those wishing to contact KCK Medical, here is their web"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,4.0,"When I found out I had a wheat intolerance I thought I would never have biscotti again. (or cookies or pancakes or many other things) Thanks to my husband, I discovered Pamela's cookies about a year ago and have been loving them ever since! When I found out they also make biscotti, I ordered them right away. No local stores carry these,and I have no idea why, thank goodness for Amazon!I am picky about wheat alternatives but I really like these. They are not exactly the same as the wheat version, but they are very close. I tried the Almond Anise flavor and they taste really good. The texture is a bit grainy and they are more dense than wheat biscotti, so you can really dunk them with out fear of them crumbling.I was worried about the quantity, but since they are individually wrapped, and so good we had no problem!Pamela's makes the best wheat alternatives bar none! If you haven't tried them I cannot recommend them strongly enough! You have GOT to try the organic peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. They are soooo good! The pancake mix is great and really any of the cookies. They have made me feel so much less deprived!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"these bags leaked terribly....milk was only frozen for 2 months or so....most of these bags leaked....if you plan on freezing breastmilk, GET THE LANSINOH BAGS!!!! they are thicker, they have a double seal, and i don't think we've had a single lansinoh bag leak yet. the gerber bags are a joke, gerber should be ashamed for even putting them out for sale. you'd be better off trying to freeze your milk in a sandwich baggie."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences. It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour. Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls. If you don't mind that, then good for you! (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.) I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough. Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it. I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,We bought these for our son and it was spill proof the first time he used it and after that the part of the inside (makes it spill proof) wont stay on. you pay $8 for 2 cups and they dont even last a day.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,We use this for all of our cooking. It is great for frying any thing. To Me it makes things taste better. It is the only oil I use. We stopped using all other oils now except extra virgin olive oil for my salads. We even add a half teaspoon to our hot tea and it gives it a great flavor. My wife even uses it for her hair. It makes it soft and now she has no more split ends.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"The perfect thing to ""just fill a spot"" without resorting to something less heathful."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"Been using this for almost two years. Feel pleasantly filled out and solid while it's in the system. Can be depended on to supply consistent energy under physically demanding situations. Great if you work in a warehouse. Can also be taken before bed to maintain anabolic(?) body condition. Only slight concern- it does have some fat, so, it feels like might have gained a gram or two after usage. Normally that feeling subsides hours after ingestion. Overall Very good product. As good or better than much higher priced supplements, way, way over muscle milk. WAY over muscle milk."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"My Physical Therapist told me about this device, and it lives up to her assurances. You can take care of a great many sore, problem areas by yourself--very comfortable and easy to use."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I love this tea! It has a lovely fruity taste and is much better than some health store versions.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,I got this for my Mom who has to split one of her medications in half. Every month when she gets her prescription she sits down and splits the entire 30 day supply in half. It only take a couple of minutes and she's done. She's very happy with this product. Before she used a sharp knife and was constantly retrieving pill halves off the floor. This product does a good job of containing the halves and makes splitting the pills in half much more accurate. This is a great product for the elderly and those with sight impairment.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"This is a rich and flavorful demi-glace. To be sure, it's not as thick and gloppy as some, having a more stock-like consistency. Yet, it does a great job of enriching a wide variety of sauces."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"This is the best manual pump! It works so well that I get the same volume as with my electric pump only faster sometimes. The only thing I don't like about it is that when you are done it drips from the cup, same with the electric though. Maybe they need to angle it more to avoid that. Also when the bottle is screwed on, if you tip the pump over milk will spill out through the threads where the bottle is screwed on and fast, so be careful, its frustrating. But over all I am very happy with it."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"The product heats my bottles up evenly enough,however, I was a little dissapointed as to the length of time it took to heat one up. 5oz. took almost 7 minutes. When you have a hungry baby,every second counts."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"this is a great tea and worth it's price but if you do buy, buy in bulk because the shipping price is higher than the regular price"

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"This is best used in a recliner chair. The only thing I didn't like is that they should have made it a tad bit longer so it will be more comfortable for taller people. Other than that, 15 minutes in the chair and I feel like a new person."

baby products,feeding,food,4.0,"I used this in combination with a baby food cookbook, I steam everything first, and then just run it thru the processor. I have made fruit and veggies so far, and they all turn out great. The only downfall is that the directions that come with it are very basic. They do not mention steaming anything first, and this step is necessary for your babys tummy and for it to ""mush"" up. It really makes the entire process very easy."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,I like the sleep mask because it helps me sleep better but it won't stay on my head the whole time while i sleep. They need to make the band a little bit tighter so that it can snuggle around the head better. Otherwise it is a pretty good product
health personal care,health care,allergy,4.0,It cleans all the pollen out of your sinuses. I bought it for my pregnant coworker who is miserable right now. This is a natural way to relieve allergies. The only drawback is that it only works for two hours. Then you have to repeat. But any relief is great when your pregnant and cant take any drugs. So Ive been told.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Very good coffee, has a lot of flavor and personality. My favorite of the bunch."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Five servings of vegetables in a scoop. WOW! I read that several times to make sure it was right! I put one scoop in a twelve ounce smoothie and I can barely taste it. It is so high in nutrition. In this era that we live in with the depleted food values. Who can't use a superfood?
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,I contacted Kellogg's regarding having trouble finding Fruit Harvest and they said they were not making it anymore do to it's unpopularity. They sent me a coupon for a box of their icky yogurt cereal. I was shopping yesterday at Walmart and found they had cases of my favorite cereal. Woohoo...I bought 4 boxes and it doesn't expire until 2008.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,3.0,I thought this would be really good soup since it's made by Wolfgang Puck but it taste like any other canned soup. Its o.k. but not great
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Well.. I use this product on my lower denture and WOW!!! This is the best product I ever used to have a ""Secure"" fit for my denture. It last me at least a full day and sometimes into the next day. I have tried many other commercial products but this one beats them all. Yes.. it is a little more expensive but it is worth the results. I use other commercial products for my top denture since I don't have any issues with my top denture as I experienced with my lower. I have told my friends about this product and they are converts as well."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,This is the second time I have ordered these pads. They wash beautifully and are large enough to protect any surface. I keep an extra pad in my car for emergencies. They don't change shape and don't slip around off the chair surface.
health personal care,health care,unknown,4.0,"This is a good product. The 4 star score is 3 for pain relief (per my wife) and 5 for portability. My wife has chronic pain. While prescription medicine will eliminate or at least lessen the pain, topical relief helps if her pain is severe. Something she can carry in her purse is needed on occasion. These packets are very helpful on trips, etc. The medicine in them is as good as any topical preparation and will allow her a lessening of the pain strong enough to let her ignore the problem and carry on conversations, etc. It sometimes means the difference between us being able to go somewhere and not travelling at all."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,I was looking for a healthier snack since I am trying to lose weight. I keep this in my office and at home and even eat a pack for breakfast. It is great and my kids age 5 and 2 love it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,Great pre-workout supplement I've taken... Keeps me focused and ready to attack the weights.....
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"It's great, but you don't need it if you buy the one-week version because it can separate into a small, one-day version with a timer."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I've had 3 masks before this one, the last one a Ciccia Bella which I thought was pretty good. I was going to replace that one, but bought the Escape instead because I liked all the details given on the Dream Essentials website. I sleep on my side tending to rub my face on the pillow to settle, and the mask doesn't shift. It feels very comfortable on my head, not too hot or bulky (unlike a fleece one I had!! what was the mfr. thinking?)and my sleep is definitely deeper. Agree with the other reviewer that what you can't see in the photo is an indentation for your eyes, so that you never feel any pressure on your eyes from the mask. The only issue I had was a headache the first morning after I wore it which I think may be due to the fabric sizing used; I recommend washing before use."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,I started with the 400mg and realized I had a huge appetite and needed the 750mg. I've had the best results since about 6 days after I started taking it. After 6 weeks I've lost 17 pounds and just keep losing!!! I've told all my friends that this is the one that works!!!
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,"The Sensible Foods Cherry Berry snacks are great. I keep them at my desk and anytime I need a little something they are perfect. No drips or dribbles on the keyboard. I have ordered some other selections of the dried fruit, but be mindful that there are more apple pieces than berries. The pouches average about 2 blueberries, 6 strawberry slices and 2 cherries."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,This a great protein supplement for busy people. I use this to mix with frozen fruit and water to make a great breakfast drink. I may put a spoonful on cereal and milk.It is meant to supplement your meals rather than be a meal substitute. It cuts hunger.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"A friend introduced this product to me and I dear say, it's excellent! I am so happy I can use Agave instead of sugar substitutes if I desire to deviate from my norm. Agave, pronouned a-gar-vee, taste good, it's nice and sweet, it dosen't raise my blood sugar levels and it hasn't caused me any weight gain. It's a natural."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I loved these and gave them as gifts. Everyone that I know that used them loved them. Great for preventing gas and aid with acid reflux problems.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I've used Sweet & Low, Equal, Splenda and Stevia. I've heard really bad things about Equal and Splenda so I stopped using them. Additionally, I heard Sweet & Low caused cancer in rats. Sweet & Low was never pulled from the shelves because it was established that millions of people used it for several years with no problems. It was deemed safest of the 3 big sellers.When Stevia arrived on the scene, it received a great, many excellent reviews, except it didn't taste very good -- so NuNaturals came out with a non-bitter version of Stevia. It was quite expensive until I encountered it at Amazon.com. The price is right and Stevia has, at this point in time, joined the ranks as one of the safest. I've enjoyed the new and improved version and rate it 4 stars because I wish it were as sweet as Sweet & Low."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"If you've lost all of your tastebuds in a freak accident, and have the chewing capacity of a bovine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise...I threw my 3/4 full box in the garbage, something I almost never do since I'm fairly tolerant of a wide range of food. But this stuff tasted so bad, and the consistency was so rock hard, that I wish Amazon allowed ""minus stars"". To call this food or a meal replacement is a joke."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We had this seat for our first child and loved it. It replaced the bulky high chair and we often moved it to the counter so my son could sit and do projects or eat while I was cooking. After a while the clamp stopped working -- it would clamp on but wouldn't losen to come off the table well. So, we bought a new one for our daughter. So, even though it did wear out, we liked it enough to buy a second one."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"These chair pads are attractive, very washable, and do the trick to protect, chairs, wheelchairs or whatever else needs protection from wetting."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,1.0,"No, I love these crackers. I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet. Just not too bad at allEXCEPTThe order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special. In the end, the loser is me. When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"After this ""flavor"" of popcorn was dropped by another microwave popcorn company, I was disappointed. I did a google search and was lucky to find this product from Orville Redenbacher. Next problem was that I could not find it in Arizona anywhere.I contacted the Redenbacher parent company Con-agra and received a very nice but apologetic response about not having the product distributed in Arizona. So Amazon to the rescue..... ordered without difficulty and received in a timely manner. Now at least I know I can get more of the Corn on the Cob popcorn if I run out !!!!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"My baby enjoys the toy enough, but I bought it specifically bc I was looking for a product I could stick to the tray on her high chair so she would have something to entertain her that she couldn't throw to the floor in two seconds. The suction cup is basically useless. I do NOT recommend this item if the suction cup is one of the features that attracts you to it."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,4.0,"This popcorn has hulls, which I don't care for. It's not labeled as hulless, so it's not deceptive. I just thought for the price it would be - my bad. I only use the whilry pop popper, so this review is relevant to that method only. It produces somewhat light, crispy popcorn of fairly large size with a real popcorn taste. I did think it would pop larger though. It's good for the coated popcorns I like to make. It's not the best I've tasted though. Fireworks makes some delicious, hulless varieties that have spoiled me, I'm afraid. The company ships fairly fast, and the shipping cost is what I'd expect it to be. I'm ruined by Amazon Prime though, so to pay any shipping at all is a drawback; that being said, for this quality popcorn plus the S&H cost, I won't buy it again - simple as that - and for no other reason than that."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,5.0,"I was hesitant to order these after reading the poor reviews, but am I glad I did. I give it 5 stars because this is the best lo-carb snack I have found. The taste is not out of this world but is good for a lo-carb item. Also, they are filling. I can't eat a full bag at one sitting like I would have done with many other snacks. I am buying more today."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I have been ordering this at a lower price and now they increase the price. I won't be ordering through here anymore, it is cheaper to go to the store."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"This soup is a little more than just ""mildly"" seasoned, as the can says; it's actually got quite a kick. (I like spicy food, so that's a good thing.) The ingredients include grill-marked onions and corn, big hearty chunks of potato, some black beans, and a little tomato. The stock has some olive oil but it's not overly greasy and actually quiet light. Overall, a great vegan soup option."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,i don't know much about detoxification other than what you hear about the stars on tv but she said it was an interesting and pleasant experience.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"For anyone who suffers from migraines, you know it is no joke. When my health insurance company cut me way down on my Rx for migraines I was panicked. I saw this product on the pharmacy shelf and thought I would give it a try. After 2 weeks of use, no migraines so far.It needs to be taken 3 times a day, so one box of 45 will only last 15 days, but I think it may be worth it to avoid the suffering through migraines and the after-effects. I plan to keep taking it and will report back in a few more weeks. If you suffer from migraines, I really feel for you. I know what it is like. I think it is much better to try to avoid getting them than to try to get rid of it once it comes. I am hoping MigraSolve is the answer."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,"I don't know if it's the sea salt or what, but you can actually taste the potato in these chips. The chips are not greasy, and they're nice and thick. And knowing that they're a much healthier choice than other brands, is important to me. But even if they're a healthier choice, we would not purchase them unless they tasted great. And these are great! And with AMAZON'S packaging and fast delivery, I definitely will be ordering most of my chips here."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,This chair is more of a vibrating chiar attachment than a massage attachment I like it more for games and music (thats why i bought it). I leave the vibration function on for like 5 minutes because it numbs my back and then gets annoying if your looking for a cheap game chair buy this it works great as a surround sound system since the speakers are behind you. But if your looking for a massage chair pony up a few more dollars and get something better than this
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Despite what others have said, I actually like the taste better than any other protein powder I have tried. (that is, the chocolate one). I Mix this with rice, soy, or almond milk. and use a fork instead of a spoon to mix it, that will break up any clumps, it will disburse fairly quickly this way. I definitely recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"My 14 month old son is a very picky, fickle eater. Some days he'll eat grapes, other days he'll throw them angrily to the floor as though I'm trying to poison him. But Annie's Cheddar Bunnies are a sure thing. He'll eat them for breakfast, lunch or dinner and bounces up and down happily when he sees the purple box. Though I'd prefer he ate something more substantial, at least I know they're made from real ingredients including organic flour and real cheese. They're also lower in sodium than many comparable cheese crackers including the Earth's Best Organics brand which I appreciate. Most importantly, since many of my meals these days consist of his leftovers, they're delicious."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I have been taking this supplement for a month and half now and I might as well be pouring sand in my mouth. It does not work or evoke any of the feelings so passionately referred to in other reviews. You can get the same results by simply buying yogurt. It's cheaper and tastes better.In fact, if you read the other reviews carefully many of them have the same tone, remarks and ""born again"" story lines. Even the use of CAPS seems to be consistent. Hmmmm, now how would that happen?"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,We're recommended to have 3-4000mg of Potassium a day. A banana has 300+mg. The pill is not even a drop in the bucket. Not worth taking in such a small quantity. Much better to just eat right.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,3.0,"Not the best flavor, but it tastes alright. Probably not going to order more because it just doesn't leave you wanting too."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,2.0,"I love dried fruit snacks, and these looked great from the product description.Maybe, I got a batch of poor quality items, but they are just horrible. They are difficult to open and plastic from the packaging sometimes sticks to the product. Even if open the individual packages with a scissors, they are difficult. I had two cases with different expiration dates, and both are the same way.The product itself is edible, but very dry, a bit sticky and plastic-like. The flavor is unimpressive. I ate about a dozen of them; but I doubt I will ever finish the 2 cases I purchased. I wonder if the food bank will take them. I wish I could edit my review down to 1-star.PS"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,3.0,"It's quite tasty, but it is pretty much powder. I guess I was expecting a little bit of chunks of meat?!? The word 'jerky' implies to me that there would be. Don't be confused--there is not. I wouldn't purchase again not because of the taste, but powder isn't quite my thing."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I have literally tried hundreds of hot sauces and salsas, Bite Me has been favorite for flavor for many years. Not real hot, but loaded with chipotle and garlic flavor, I put it on everything, especially good on pizza! You can't lose with this one!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"After my son got a diagnosis on the Autism spectrum, I started doing research on diet. Our diet has changed dramatically; we are all dairy, wheat and refined sugar free, but the one thing my son missed was the cereal bar. I used to give him TONS of the Nutri-Grain bars until I read what was in them. (Just try to find one without HFCS!) These are the perfect substitute. Not only do they taste great, but they travel well. I toss one in his backpack for pre-school snack time and it holds him for hours. I paid $7 for a box of 6 in the store then came here to find them on SALE??!! I just ordered four boxes and will be ordering more. We've tried the choco peanut flavor and it's a toddler favorite. I'm a fan of the superfood. They also don't look over processed or ""manicured"". They look like something I would make, but in attractive packaging so my son thinks he's getting a treat. Love them, love them, love them!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"They claim 200 mg, but its actually only 16 mg. I don't know how they get away with such a blatantly misleading headline. I wouldn't trust the rest of the ingredients or purity given Jarrow's willingness to try to trick customers.Competitors' products have honest labeling and as a result, are much more cost effective.I'm surprised Amazon allows Jarrow to continue to sell on their site."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,I absolutely love this stuff! I mix it in with my coffee and creamer every morning and even add it to sauces and baked goods for extra protein.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've now gone through 2 boxes of this stuff, about to order 2 more. Uses HIGH QUALITY carbs from brown rice and such, and has 40 grams of protein! Awesome for anyone who wants to look better.After my 2 boxes of this stuff, and a dedicated gym regimen, I've gained 20 pounds, PURE MUSCLE! I used to think I was a hard gainer, turns out I just wasn't eating right."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I tried the other flavor -- Brazilian, Columbia and Sumatra, they are all too weak for my taste. Seems like the Kenya Blend is a bit stronger."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,1.0,The shipment arrived timely but the chips were all in crumbs. A new shipment was sent out by Amazon and that arrived in a box that was already ripped open and I was advised by the post office to refuse delivery which I did. I'm now waiting for the refund Amazon promised me.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I love this drink. I put it in a blender and add bananas and ice (to make it cold like a milk shake) or any other fruit and even peanut butter. You can have twice as many drinks if you make them not quite as thick (use half a packet). I get the vanilla and add chocolate to make a chocolate drink. I make mine with plain soy milk (lactose intolerent). It tastes great and is low fat, low calorie and fills you up."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"This was a great way to try out all the teas flavors without the worry of buying one flavor and not liking it-stuck with the cost of six boxes. I loved most of them, but there were a couple that were not my favorites. None of them tasted bad, and most of them seemed to enlighten me in some way. I would not buy the variety pack again-in bulk. The favorites that I liked will be purchased in bulk. I would recommend if you buy this, give a box or two away to a friend or family member. Then you can pick and choose or trade teas. Next time you will know what you like out of the bunch and can order from there."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"This pillow is wonderful for feeding baby. Holds him/her close to your body, and nearer to breast than a regular pillow or the boppy. I was having terrible backaches before I began to use this product, but the back support with the BrestFriend is great and I began to feel better. I used this throughout my home and even in the car. I don't think there is much difference between this version and the deluxe, except the deluxe version's strap has a velcro closure as well as a plastic closure. I bought this one because other mothers told me that when they pulled back the velcro, it woke the baby up. The plastic closure on this model works just fine, and opens quietly. My only complaint about the product is that the inside foam pillow is hard to clean (the baby had diaper leaks and of course milk leaked onto the pillow as well). I wish the manufacturer would provide a plastic cover between it and the slipcover. I also found it very challenging to get the slipcover back onto the pillow, so I always gave that job to my husband. All in all, it was very comfortable for baby, and great for my back!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I purchased this hand pump when my 5 year old was born and used it to pump at home while I nursed him exclusively for a year (I used an electric pump when I was working). The pump is comfortable on your skin, and is easy to use with one hand and the suction matches that of an electric pump without all of the noise. It's awesome. I saved it and I'm now using it with my two month old. I highly recommend it!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"7-Keto purports to be a lowered-risk-of side effects form of DHEA, an androgenic steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, which are about the size of ping-pong balls and located on top of your kidneys, and, not surprisingly, excreted in urine. Among other things, the adrenal glands function as the control center for the well-known ""fight or flight"" response but ongoing constant stress may create adrenal fatigue or even exhaustion, thus low levels of DHEA (which decreases with age anyway) may aggravate chronic fatigue, depression and decreased sex drive, among other things. However, since DHEA is the precursor hormone to estrogen, progesterone and testosterone poduction, this is no mere ""fountain of youth"" weight-loss aiding nutritional suppement skin and libido candy. Some doctors have asked the FDA to seriously consider whether DHEA and it's newer cousin, 7-Keto, should even be sold without formal counseling of some type. Proponents claim that since formal Western medicin is great at treating full-fledged disease but less skilled (right now) at prevention and reversal of precursor conditions, judicious use of DHEA or this newer and allegedly improved form, 7-Keto, is just another one of those buyer beware situations, and there are a lot worse things one can do legally to one's body than ingest a single supplement daily in this category. Some users claim that this supplement helps with kicking caffeine and other stimulants. Anyway, TwinLab makes quality products, I have a few whiskers on my chinny-chin-chin anyway, and I don't take birth control pills or estrogen supplements, so I don't feel as if I am overdoing it from another direction. And at less than [...] a bottle, I'm eager to see if a two-month course of 7-Keto supplementation helps me gain lean muscle mass and feel friskier overall, but it will be hard to tell since I've been working out more and eating better anyway. So, it's a great value, but a potent form of a supplement some feel is a little risky anyway, so use your own judgment."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I'm pretty new to the whole anal douche scene, so I'm still trying to learn about all the details that go into rating a product like this one. But seriously, this baby really blew me away! It stores what used to be inside my body in a practical and non-smelly way. Plus it's safe around kids"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I am not a breakfast person, but Luna bars have managed to drag me kicking and screaming into eating something before lunch. Chocolate Peppermint is by far my favorite. I've also found they make great snack bars. And they're a lot cheaper to buy by the box."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"I suppose if you have been gluten free for a long time this bread is great, but it has a slightly sweet taste (some may like that) and its much like other gluten free breads, its very dense. It is better than most I've had though and the price is right.. I use it for bread crumbs to make meatballs.. something I haven't been able to do until recently.Its a good product for the money, considering how much a gluten free diet costs - I just couldn't use it for bread.. it does however make a decent pizza crust.. haven't tried it for much else."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I used these with my first child and LOVED them. They are easy to clean and assemble, comfortable to hold, vented great and reduceded the reflux my first son suffered from. We recently had our second child and I bought several new Avent bottles to use with him. I just threw them all away and bought another brand of bottle. This time around these bottles leaked horribly, the slowest nipple is too fast and caused our new baby to choke and swallow way to much air. My recomendation would be to buy one of several different kinds of bottles and decide which works best for your baby."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I started buying Choline Chloride after reading research into ""smart drugs"" (compounds to enhance cognitive function) some years ago. The theory with Choline Chloride is that it increases the body's access to the chemical building blocks of the neurotransmitter Acetyl Choline and that this access produces an increase in some measures of intellectual ability.Whether or not this works is largely subjective. Its effects are subtle and might be the result of the placebo effect. I only know that when I use it, I tend to write more and faster than when I don't, and that one co-worker who tried it said it gave her the feeling of being ""detached"" or ""disengaged.""Interestingly enough, the liquid form of the compound that you find here is not the only form. Twinlabs offers a powdered form of the compound (""choline cocktail"") to which they add caffeine and various other things in a way that seems not altogether honest. That is, if the actual compound you're paying for has real efficacy on its own, why should the manufacturer have to ramp up the effects with energy-boosting components?I like the liquid version I review here and I prefer it because Vitamin Research at least trusts their product to function on its own without augmentation. One important thing to keep in mind when taking Choline Chloride"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"I picked these up on a whim in the deli section of the grocery store to share with my friends for the drive home. To my amazement I ate half the bag before they even got in the car! Very tasty, greaseless with good crunch and excellent savory flavor, much lower in calories than potato chips. I prefer the 1.5 oz bag purely to keep me within the limits of overeating them and I feel good putting them in the kids' lunch bags."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,just keeps getting better and better all the time. This flavor is excellently put together. It is one of my kids favorite snacks.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Good quality at the best price I could find. It tastes pretty good for a protein powder, and dissolves easily in a shaker bottle. Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best protein powder available."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I have been buying the unsweetened carob chips from a local high end supermarket. I decided to try these since they cost less. What a mistake! These taste like cardboard! I was very disappointed after having bought 5 lbs. thinking they would be the same. These are awful! I had to throw them out and go back to buying the other ones at the supermarket. Sometimes it doesn't pay to try and save money, in this case it didn't. Also, when they arrived, 2 packages were melted, so they were not packaged well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Our dogs absolutely love their Zukes. We like them too as we feel they are superior to what is normally available commercially. Plus it really helps keep their breath sweet. Dog Gone Clean (the seller) is great, too. They are prompt and carry some nice items. We have already reordered from them and had the same reliable service as before!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,1.0,"This is the WORST Trail Mix I ever tasted. The fruit part (raisin, papaya, apricots, etc) are super sweet in a bad way, you are better off going directly eating table suger. The peanuts are stale and you can see by eye that at least half of them are BAD. This is anything BUT healthy food. Now what shall I do with a whole box of these?I am very upset at the irresponsibility of the previous reviewer, (at the time I am writing this review, the only one), who give exactly same five star reviews to five different products from this brand (I found out this too late). Lessons learned"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I'm still not convinced of it's ability to help relive the ringing in your ears, I still have that issue and haven't really noticed any change or lessening in volume. As for it's other attributes, well, I can only surmise that it isn't hurting me or complicating things in my physiology that might not be affected by not taking it."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I can't eat cane sugar or mollases (from cane sugar), it gives me rashes. HOwever, I can use Barley Malt syrup. I use it in baking mostly instead of Molasses. Works great!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"This item is absolutely wonderful. It rolls up so easily and takes up just a little space in the diaper bag. It's easy to use and easy to clean. I don't have to worry about my daughter eating off the table because moms you know that plates get slung all over the place. And the little tray at the bottom catches all of the spillage. For all of you bacteria-phobe moms, this is a great item for your child or to give as a gift. I am always recommending it. People are always asking me where I got it too. The suction cups are very good and can mostly stand up to my daughter's immense strength. Make sure the surface is absolutely dry before putting the mat down or else it can and will slide around and pop up. My only complaint is that it doesn't stick to the laminated wood tables that they have at so many places like Red Lobster and other family restaurants where it can't be used. It would be nice if the suction cups were a little bigger and if they had a little silicone around the edges of bigger suction cups I think it would stick to nearly any surface including the laminated wood. But overall for $10 bucks, geez this is an awesome product!!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Tazo has done it again, folks. When they concocted Zen, they definitely knew what they were doing. For starters, this isn't your abuela's green tea. Zen has notes of ingredients that include exotic green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint and natural flavor. I especially took note of the spearmint, upon sipping it for the first time. It's invigorating and dances on your tongue. You can drink Zen with (or without) honey. It's really your preference. The tea tastes great on its own, but honey adds a great note of sweetness to this wonderful blend of herbal and green tea. This is one habit you don't need to worry about breaking. If you are ever feeling stressed out, make a date with yourself and set five minutes aside to sip this lovely beverage. You won't be sorry."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"These cracker snack packages are great for lunches or a bite on the go! They are a big hit with everyone in our family - the crackers are similar to a Ritz, but are a little crisper and lighter. And the four cracker size seems to be better suited for kid sized tummies than the six cracker packs. You can't go wrong with snack crackers!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,We love this cup! It's one of the few cups that my son with cerebral palsy can use by himself (given the handles and straw). It leaks much less than other cups of this nature and really fosters his independence.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Lower in calories for the amount of protein it provides. Has a natural taste unlike other protein bars that mask their bars with chocolate flavor, ect... It's on the chewy side and I don't feel like I am chewing on cardboard or something synthetic. Great for on-the-go- at 230 calories/40 fat calories/16g protein a bar."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I am always looking for healthy food finds and I am so pleased to find this one. The flavor is yummy and tart, and knowing that the ingredients are ""pure"" makes me feel good about eating it."
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,"This product seemed appealing, but it didn't work really well for me. I followed the directions as directed. By the fourth day, I was breaking out like crazy all over the area I put the serum on. Normally, I don't have pimple issues, so I know I got them from this product. After that fouth day I never used it again. It took about five days for my face to clear up. In the meantime, I coresponded with the representatives from Zenmed. At first, the e-mails were annoying in that they kept responding with this clueless response, after I explained myself several times.Overall, I did get my refund, which they issue you a check that comes in the mail. They have specific directions in which they want you to follow. Since, I followed them, I didn't have any problems getting a refund."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I like the tea however, I thought I was ordering the authentic Wu long Slim Tea endorsed by Oprah Winfrey.I don't think this is the authentic Wu Long Tea that is advertised. I am pleased with the delivery timeframe."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Unrefined oil is not processed, bleached, deodorized and stripped so I will always pick that over the refined, but I must admit that I don't use coconut oil for cooking, I use it on my skin and hair! Although this oil has a very high smoking point, I am always worried about the true health benefits. Coconut oil may be associated with atherogenesis (disease affecting arterial blood vessels) so I choose to use for the topical benefits rather than ingesting it.I have learned from my boss who is form India, the secrets to her lovely shiny hair, and it's simply about warming up some coconut oil. I spoon it out if it's solid into a small glass bowl and microwaving for about 15 seconds then massaging my hair and scalp then tying a bun and letting it soak in for as long as I can ( anywhere between 15 minutes to hours or even overnight) then shampooing out with a clarifying or non moisturizing shampoo. Usually one shampoo is enough, sometimes if I have extra oil on the hair I shampoo again and then condition as usual.The sheen, bounce and manageability is incredible, I have never been as impressed with a product for the hair as with this simple treatment. The oil is inexpensive and lasts forever and the results are simply dazzling. For those with dry and fried hair, colored, tired or simply hair that needs a deep treatment this is heavenly. Even fine hair that has never been abused can benefit for it.I use this as often as I can, but once a week is sufficient, although the way the hair feels after is addictive and I can never wait to do it again.- Kasia S."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,This is an excellent product. The major problem is once you start eating them you can't stop and the bag is only 5 oz.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"it's THE best item you can buy! practical, easy to carry, easy to store.maybe, it should come with 3 9oz bottles and 1 4oz, instead of 2 and 2; becuase babies rapidly start needing more and more...also all mags that come with these items are great, with great tips, some of them are not even included in m. stoppard's book! very useful.i STRONGLY recommend this item!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"This drug is very effective against acid reflux and GERD without need of more expensive prescription drugs. It is a Proton pump inhibitor and works very well to control chronic heartburn. Prilosec may take a few days to be effective and is not taken periodically but every day for 14 days. The effectiveness is dramatic. In most cases there is no heartburn for an extended period after recommended dosage. Check with a Doctor before use to rule out a serious problem, and you may be advised to use this to control your symptoms as I was."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"The Amaretto is my favorite of all the great tasting Caffe D'Vita products. And I really do like them better than anything Starbucks has to offer, not to mention they're all 99% caffine free."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We live in the Midwest and have family on both coasts, so we spend a lot of time on airplanes. This booster seat has been terrific - it folds easily and fits into the overhead compartment on small regional jets. The tray cover means you can whip it out and use it whenever you need to, without worrying about travel grime on the tray.When you get where you're going, the seat is easy to set up and secures to a chair with two straps - one under the seat of the chair and one around the back - so you can feel confident your child is safe. You can also use one of the straps to sling the thing over your shoulder, which is great for traveling through airports with the full complement of carry-ons while still trying to keep a hand free to fumble around for ID, boarding pass, snack box, dropped toys, etc.Of course, the cup holder doesn't actually fit the wide base of our sippy cup, but that's typical of high chair trays, too, so I can't knock off points for that.Overall, I think this is a terrific product and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a booster seat or high chair replacement."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"My fiancee says that Japanese tea is ""grassy,"" and that aspect certainly comes out in this tea, although it is exceptionally smooth. It's great as an iced tea with Splenda, but much lighter than your black teas."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I use this when my friend visits with her baby. It works well for her 10-month old, 20 pound little cutie. My favorite part is how easy it is to clean, not to mention the price. After reading other reviews I wonder if daily use would change my opinion, but I don't know how. I've been quite happy with it."
health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"I ordered two bottles, and they mixed up my order and sent me one bottle of Clemastine and one bottle of something else. I had to ship back the wrong bottle and call customer service to send me another one. I never got the 2nd bottle of Clemastine."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"This was recommended to me by my pulmonologist. I have a tendency to get bad sinus infections that lead to bad lung infections. This has really helped relieve the problem. And when it says ""no sting"" it means it, I was sure this product would hurt, but it is very gentle. My only complaint is that I don't enjoy the feeling of water up my nose whether it stings or not, but the benefits (being able to finally breathe, smell, etc.) have kept me using it despite the awkward feeling. If you have allergies and other sinus problems, this a great addition to your other medications and routines to help relieve the problems."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"If you're looking for non-surgical ways to lose weight, the best track is FEWER CALORIES & EXERCISE. Eating smaller meals is one way to reduce caloric intake. Eating the same size meals with fewer calories is another. Or, lastly, stop the food that you injest from actually being absorbed by your body.Alli works on the principle of the latter, by blocking your body's ability to digest injested fat. And, in contrast to a lot of ads you might see on television, IT WORKS! YAY! I really have to congratulate whatever scientists actually figured out how to do this.Ok, but here's the downside. IT WORKS. Your body doesn't digest the fat, so it just goes through the rest of your digestive tract... and causes all sorts of unpleasant side effects along the way. They're really unpleasant. Seriously. I can't begin to convey how remarkably unpleasant they actually are. No matter what you heard, you will not be prepared. I actually took prescription Orlistat when it came out a few years ago, and, after stopping due to the side effects, I was *still* not prepared when I started Alli again recently.On the other hand, the side effects give you this great incentive to stay away from the pizza & deep fried chicken!!!For me, I eat remarkably healthy most of the time. I try and basically eliminate the need for Alli. But every so often, I get dragged to a business/social dinner or have to travel with few healthy food options available to me. In those cases where eating poorly is totally unavoidable, it's really nice to have Alli in my pocket."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,"This product seemed to work fine for the first month, but after that it didn't detect ovulation properly. The second and third months it detected ovulation a week late! I had to use an ovulation predictor kit to verify if the OV Watch was working correctly, and it was not. I received a surge from the OPK and the OV Watch didn't detect ovulation until much later. I was very disappointed with this product and the company only has a 30 day return policy. It takes more than 30 days to determine if this product is working for you. I wish I bought the Clear Blue Easy Monitor."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,We've been using this glucosamine powder in our protien drinks every morning for several years now. I was dubious about it at first but it's the only thing to which I can attribute the lessening of aching in my joints.It has the recommended other ingredients that should be taken along with glucosamine which many supplements don't.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I have used this pump through all 3 of my children (I bought it in 1999), I can definitely say I've gotten my money's worth! I have nursed a total of 6 years, and this little pump has held up so well - I've not had a single problem with it.The pump is small, very portable (compared with electric counterparts), and 20% of the price of the popular double electric models.Your milk pumps directly into an Avent bottle, in which you can then store the milk or feed immediately.There are some small pieces that need to be washed after each use - this can be difficult when on the road - this was really the only thing I considered less than ideal about the pump (although I'm not sure there's any avoiding that).Every woman's body is different, so I cannot claim that this pump will work for everyone as well as it has for me. I didn't plan to use it as much as I did when I bought it (I didn't return to work full time, so I didn't think I'd need a double electric pump), however I ended up donating milk to a local milk bank after my first child was born. With this pump only, I pumped 12 oz every morning for my oldest child's first year. This took me about 15 minutes each morning.For me, this pump has been economical, efficient, portable, and easy to use. It's obviously a personal thing - a pump can work great for one woman and poorly for another, but I have been extremely happy with this one."

The left over pie crust would be arranged on a baking sheet and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Of course, this was a decadent treat, but one that I adored and always made me feel good. I love these pita chips and encourage anyone who has not tried them to do so, especially if you like cinnamon. This is a great snack and definitely would be great if paired with coffee or tea, though I lean on hot tea a bit more than coffee. Try it; I do not think you will regret it. My husband and daughter love them too! Thank you Stacy's and Thank you Amazon!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"Obviously nothing will make scars totally disappear right away, but this stuff helps alot. I had some pretty gnarly scratches from my new kitty, one on my leg and one on my wrist that were particularly bad that are fading fast thanks to mederma. I didn't start treating the one on my wrist right away because I wash my hands so much, and it started to turn into a raised keloid scar. I was really bummed about it, started applying mederma religiously, and layers have been peeling off so that now the scar is almost completely flat. This stuff is definitely worth it, especially for the price."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"One Size does Not fot All.It's only 2 ft long, and way too curved at the tail bone, ok of your a Pygmy but I'm 6'2"" and it's about a foot to short. I would like a full refund or a 3' model.Buyer Beware!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,3.0,These pretzel nuggets have a good flavor and are MUCH softer than other brands. Your teeth will thank you.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"Well, of course you don't want to pay shipping for a 12-pack of soft drinks from the omnipresent Gristedes. However, if you're lucky ebough to live in New York, or your local store has this, by all means get the diet black cherry flavor. This was so sweet and rich in cherry flavor, that I immediately checked out the bottle from which I was drinking--I thought I had bought the Non-Diet version! They're just aren't too many diet soft drinks that taste this good. Note"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,1.0,"Way too salty 52% and high saturated fat 70% per bag. Weird taste -- not sure what it is but it's not ""cheese"". Not for me."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Subscribed to the variety pack - great deal! Love to wake up with a cup of the kenya variety, looking forward to come home to a cup of the sumatra. Contemplating getting a senseo machine at work, but that would be to addictive, plus I might have to share!!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have been using this product along with BSN N.O.Xplode, and my recovery time has been minimal. I can workout hard and suffer little soreness. One container last a lot longer with this product, because a serving is much smaller than other products."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Buy this if you love good coffee. I took a chance and was glad I did. My other favorite is the ""Bold Organic"" from Coffee People. If you like one you'll like the other."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,O.K. UNIT WORKS O.K. AFTER THE FIRST ON I GOT I TURNED IT ON IT SHORTED OUT FRIED THE RELAY IN IT .
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I just returned from 2 weeks in London and took this small Neti pot with me, used it everyday. It was just terrific, no rough edges or bad smell as I read in another review. It was only $6 and a good deal. Maybe all of them aren't as smooth and nice as mine. I really like it alot and will take it on my next trip."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,It doesnt go all the way up or all the way down your back. After the first week we noticed that if you lean back on it normally it will make a strange grinding sound as if there is too much weight on it. Otherwise it is ok. I would not recommend it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,I've recently had surgery to re-attach the patellar tendon to the patella. I thought it would be a good idea to use this supplement to help with gaining strength/mass back into my quad's. I haven't been disappointed.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,We used this formula for the first year of our baby's life and it was WONDERFUL! I did a lot of reading before choosing this formula. I think it's a great product I loved ordering it from Amazon with free shipping. It was much easier than driving to the store and lugging home a bunch of cans.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I tried this product on a whim and within 3 days my aches and pains were seriously diminished. Within a week's time they had vanished completely!Seems to work extremely well on general aches and pains like shoulder and neck pain. Great for minor arthritic pain in the hands and feet.Things work differently for different people but I suugest you give it a try. It has really improved my quality of life! I am a dedicated customer for life.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"What a great product, with a wonderful balance of flavors and texture (not too sweet, nice and crunchy, etc.), a good value! It's even tasty with plain yogurt (try Straus). This granola with fresh fruit and milk makes an awesome breakfast or lunch...why go out to eat? I first bought it at Whole Foods, but they've stopped carrying it and now even Amazon isn't stocking it. What's up guys?? This doesn't compare with anything else, well, OK, it's comparable to homemade, but don't we all have better things to do?"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"This is the best packaged coconut water that I have ever tasted. It reminds me of the fresh coconut water right from the tree that I used to have in Jamaica. I have tried other brands of coconut water, but none can compare to Vita Coco. That is the only brand that I will buy...other that buying the real green coconut."
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,The ADC replacement lamps for the Welch Allyn pocket opphthalmoscope is totally worthless as it gives a field of light that is half-moon shaped and totally unacceptable to use.I had to return all the ADC replacement lamps and exchange for the OEM WA-03900 lamps instead.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,This is a really nice bar for massages. The girls at my local Lush store love to push it as a lotion bar in addition to massages. This is not so. It is too oily for lotion purposes.I do love the scent. It is fresh and light. It soothes and relaxes. I do love the way it makes massages feel. This bar even has fun spots to stick your fingers while using it on your partner. You will need a good shower after the massage unless your skin is super dry. Also one thing to note is a little bit goes a long way. Do not use this bar to massage just use it to spread the oil where needed.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I ordered Garden of Life Omega Zyme for the first time a couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked on these fabulous enzymes. They bring all sorts of enzymes derived from plants which is better. I used to suffer from stomach acidity and all sorts of digestive problems and after taking omega zyme for around three weeks all my digestive problems were gone and I felt a lot better with a lot more energy. Thank You Omega Zyme. I cannot live without you buddy!
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,3.0,"It's a nice pouch and holds 1-2 pacifiers. However, the snap keeps coming undone. It's intended to be hooked onto a diaper bag or purse, so it's pretty important that it stays put!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"Wore before I knew to use the batteries! Was slipping around soo much. Then when my friend was here told me to try the batter! How SAD & LOUD, what did you say?!!!"
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,"As indicated - its expensive about $47 per can at CVS. The neocate website does not charge s/h and sells it for $135 case. Insurance usually won't cover unless your child falls into the 3-5% growth area. Our son has acid reflux and dairy allergies and we have been denied by oxford three times. 1st just because, 2nd for not having allergies, 3rd for not using soy even though the Dr said in his notes he had a high probability of an allergy. State laws don't apply if your benefits are provided by your employer."
health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"After the first use, I felt fine. But later I got a really bad sinus headache that won't go away even with lots of advil. I tried the nettie pot again the next day and still got a horrible sinus headache. I would be careful before trying this, as it must not be for everyone."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"works for horses, people, dogs and cats so far. I never leave it out of my medicine cabinet."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,1.0,After seeing the reviews I thought these were good Chips. The Chips are Flavored too much. Stick to Good chips like Terra.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,I'm still waiting for Amazon to mail it to me (a month) but I ordered it directly to the company and I have to say that my hairs look much healthier.
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"Cute item! I love the red color, and fun, modern look. I also bought the matching bottle drying rack (Skip Hop Splash), which is probably a little more practical. Still, they are fun additions to my kitchen! They keep things nice and organized, and still look cool!Not exactly cheap, and I guess a baby jar organizer is not exactly a big necessity, so that could be a con.But it is very funky and hip!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"Our family did not care for this product at all. It has a strong flavor that nobody in my family would eat. Even my husband, who eats about anything, would not eat it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"The tea has a great taste and some health benefits, but it is not all that you get from it. It can be a nice entertaiment itself to you and your guests."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"Fungus amongus. This is a zinc based product with the added ingredient of some form of alcohol. It stings a little, but is more effective than anything else I have tried. I think it is due to the drying effects of the alcohol along with the healing attributes of zinc oxide. I'll be ordering more since yeast infections are a common occurrence in the hot, damp climate in which I live."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"The only reason this product gets a poor review is due to the massage feature. The memory foam is great and contours to my back. However, the massage feature is built into a plastic box within the memory foam. If you apply to much pressure, you feel the platic pressing against your back. I used it about five minutes in the car before I couldn't take it any longer. The batteries and plastic kept pressing into my back. I'm 6 feet tall and about 160 lbs, so I think anyone with a large to medium build would probably agree that the massage feature does more harm than good. As an alternative, I would recommend a lumbar support without the electronic massage feature."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,This is a product that I was hoping would help my neck pain. It is bulky and fairly worthless.
baby products,feeding,unknown,5.0,"I got this belt in the mail today and immediately tried it on. What a relief, I have a lot of ligament soreness and this relieves most of it. It is a bit big, but I know I will grow into it. It isn't as tight as it needs to be today, but it still is providing relief--as I grow it will become more effective I'm sure. The size is a little off, I could probably have gotten by with the smaller one, but all in all, I'm happy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"I've always been a big fan of Zatarain's products, and the Chicken & Rice Dinner is no exception! The combination of spices (and veggies) in the rice add a great flavor to the chicken (prepared via the box's suggested one-pan option or adding cubed chicken in). Even my picky eaters enjoyed it! I recommend this for anyone looking for a nice Cajun kick to their chicken and rice dinners!My only qualm is the quantity. A pack of 12 boxes ended up being split up and given to friends, because it was taking up too much room in my pantry. If only [...] could break it down to 6 boxes/pack."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is keeping my Dad alive. He was given less than two months to live with cancer and that was 6 months ago. Since then he has gained back over 20 pounds and is no longer bedridden. He is even driving again.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,This is a very good product and I eat it just about every day. The way I got started eating it was I needed something convenient kosher and healthy not an easy combination to find a lot of times. I originaly found this product at a specialty store but on Amazon it is a lot cheaper. So I order it by the case. It is especially good if you have seasonal allergies or a cold but is good any time. I eat it for breakfast sometimes with corn chips and it is good hot or cold. Also easy to digest. Kind of high in salt so you need to watch out for that if you have a salt problem. Well I guess that is it. Hope you enjoy the product I depend on it.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I really like biofreeze. I like it because I can carry the roll-on inmy purse with me!! I have arthritis in my back and it really helps in therelief of my pain!! I buy it in a large quantity!!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,My Dad and I became obsessed with finding this brand once we tried it. We went so far as to buy every other Rasberry flavored tea we found in the stores from cheap to expensive. And nothing else compares to Wissotzky's Brand Rasberry Tea. It makes your entire kitchen smell good while it is brewing in your cup. I love mine with a little lemon or iced in the summer. I even love the art on the box!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I don't know about the other varieties of this bar , but the Chocolate Raspberry Fudge bar is great for a meal-on-the-go or a quick lunch. If there is any problem with them it's that they are so good, I could become adicted to them."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,We received this last week and are very pleased by its softness and good looks. We might by another for the other recliner in the house.It's a good value.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"We like trying new flours for our home made bread (mostly sourdough). Spelt works very well with sourdough starter. Gives the bread a subtle nut like flavor and fine texture. Plus, it doesn't affect the rise very much (we do add gluten to assist the sourdough rise). Of amaranth, teff, and spelt, we like spelt the best."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"My chindren decided to create little recipes for the summer that worked with Wheat Thins, such as cheese and crackers or pizza. The boxes were very fresh and they came quickly."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Found this product from a local in Hawaii about 10 years ago and have used it ever since. Great for sunburn and rashes,even ones that prescription meds can't cure. Even my nephew in the military uses it in his boots. Love it"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I had an eye pillow made by a different manufacturer for about 10 years before it finally tore open. Unable to see how I could live without it, I repaired it with duct tape (hey, I'm a guy, what do you expect), but I figured it was time to get a new one. I was pleased to see on Amazon that many eye pillows, such as the DreamTime eye pillow on this page, come with zippers so the contents can be removed and the material hand-washed. I got a different color than the one on this page (I got the ""DreamTime Inner Peace Eye Pillow, Sage Velvet,"" also sold here at Amazon). The eye pillow that tore open on me was unscented and I was hesitant about getting a scented eye pillow; I was afraid it would be too perfumy. But the scent of the DreamTime eye pillow is quite pleasant and to my liking and I don't find it perfumy at all. It has a mild chamomile smell, and when I use it, it is easy for me to imagine that I am reclining in a field of wild chamomile. Having an eye pillow means not having to put my arm or arms over my eyes (or a folded up t-shirt or a towel or whatever is handy) when I want total darkness. The eye pillow gives me total darkness--100% absolute blackness. It also imparts the pleasant sensation that I get when I gently press my palms to my eyes. The scent is relaxing, the sensation of having the pillow over my eyes is relaxing, the absolute darkness is relaxing, and I highly recommend this inexpensive product (especially at the sale price) to anyone who is looking for a natural way to get some deep relaxation. DreamTimes's eye pillow comes in a sturdy reusable cardboard box (with a ribbon carrying handle). DreamTime eye pillows are obviously marketed to women and that's too bad for guys who might not consider trying them because of how they're marketed. Maybe if they make some with a camo design (just kidding). Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural aid to deep relaxation."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This is a perfect oil to cook popcorn in. The price is much more reasonable than similar oils you purchase in the grocery store. As much as I love popcorn I'm still concerned I won't use it up before it spoils. They may want to think about packaging this (and the butter flavor topping) in containers about 1/2 the size - it would save a great deal on shipping and they might sell more of their product.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"If you EVER eat out with your toddler, you need to invest in these mats. It used to disgust me to see parents wipe off a table at a restaurant and then put their chid's food directly on the table. You don't realize how unsanitary that is. These mats quickly adhere to the table, typically stay put, and provide for clean-up.I deducted a star, because sometimes, just sometimes, I am fumbling so much trying to remove the covers for the adhesive that my child starts getting a little rowdy because he's ready for his food. Also, my son likes to try to pull the placemat off the table. For the most part, he fails. But, he'll occasionally get a good pull on it and end up knocking something over.But, overall it's a great product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,4.0,"I am always looking for something good to eat on climbs and long hikes. The Sahale snacks seemed like a good bet, and while I was not disappointed, I was not blown away either.We tried the variety pack to get a good sense of the different flavors. They were all good, although quite heavy on nuts, and with less fruit content than I would have liked. Also, lacking in the sweetness category a bit.Overall, tasty, and quite portable. I would recommend them, but will probably still just buy bulk trail mix from our local store for most trips."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"when i opened up the ""new"" packaged stool, i saw that the part that holds the wheels had scuffs all over it and it was dirty!! not what you expect for being new and wrappped up. Besides all that rubbish, it does its job, so far."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"These were perfect, and a brand I am familiar with. Now I have a good source for them."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,I bought this chair because my traditional high chair was too difficult to clean--the cover was not machine washable and there were too many crevices. I like that I can simply take the fabric part off of the frame to wash it. It is pretty simple to take apart and put back together. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't fit onto my table as well as it could.
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"Anyone, like me, who has used Lavilin for decades....do not be fooled by the photo (as I was) into thinking this is the old formulation (That seems to be gone for good)or the 1/2 ounce quantity Foot Smart is advertising here. It is the same .44 ounce quantity and the new formulation that several other vendors are selling for less. The new formulation, for me, does not work as well. But still fairly well. I would give the deoderant itself 3.5 or 4 stars ( the old formulation was a 5 for sure), but downgraded the rating here because of what seems to me to be false advertising by this seller."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,"This is the first almond butter I've tried, and it's really good. It has a great texture - which is mostly grainy rather than crunchy (don't expect it to be like a supermarket peanut butter). I love it on a cracker. The taste is a bit milder than peanut butter, but much richer. When I first opened the jar, I had to put some serious elbow grease into getting the oil and the butter stirred together properly, but I stored it in the fridge (per label instructions) and I had no problems with it separating over the next two weeks as I gradually emptied the jar. Word of caution"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"These are the best gluten free cookies I have eaten. They are wonderful. I have to hide them from the kids across the street, or they would eat them all."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,1.0,"Three of the six cans in this package were damaged and powder leaked out!!! They were IN bubble wrap and the exterior packaging was not damaged, so that tells me that the cans were DAMAGED THEN WRAPPED AND SHIPPED TO ME! I would NOT feed my infant formula from a ""previously opened container"" ... would you?"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"Bad reviewer may have got a bad batch, but I am addicted to this stuff. It has electrolytes so whenever I am drained it quenches my thirst! The taste is comparable to REAL coconut."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"Carr's crackers are about as good as crackers get. They're tasty, sized right and sturdy enough for dipping."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,3Lac has saved my life. I can't say enough about it. It provides a lifelong cure for Candida with a simple maintenance dose. Very unique and reasonably priced.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,EXCELLENT QUALITY WHOLE HERB CAPSULES & REASONABLE PRICE FOR ONE OF THE BEST BRANDS AVAILABLEWHAT'S GOTU KOLA GOOD FOR?

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,I tried many products. this works...it doesn't do miracles but it does its job. just don't overdo.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"****This is a decaffienated version of Stash's chai spice tea, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version, but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine!****"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,dried fruit raisins,4.0,"Sun Maid raisins are the best brand of raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.Note"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pork rinds,5.0,"Whenever I get home from a long day and need a quick pick me up, even before dinner, I just pop a microwavable packet of bacon curls in the microwave for two minutes, then, instant snack! They're delicious! They come in regular flavor and hot-n-spicy (my all time favorite!). You should try 'em... I think you'll like 'em..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"With high hopes, I tried the vanilla flavored Natural Whey. Disgusting! WAY too sweet--almost inedible for my tastes. And the vanilla flavoring is too strong as well. What were they thinking?Still searching for a good quality whey protein with nothing artificial AND without added flavoring or sweetener.(Update"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"This unit has really helped us with pain of all kinds, including intestinal discomfort, strained muscles, and arthritis. We are very pleased with it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,I had a discectomy and fusion in my neck and this the best neck pillow I have found. Without this pillow I have pain all the time with it I have none. I bought one for my father inlaw and he also will not live without it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,These are great for the person on the go. Satisfies your hunger and has a good taste too. Will be buying again.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I had always purchased DMAE in brick and mortar stores but after my most recent move away from large metropolitan areas found that I was having trouble finding this supplement. Compared prices online and was happy to find the same dosage and brand at a good price on Amazon.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"It is not salty, like most seasoning blends. It adds just enough pizazz to anything. It works on pizza, pasta, toast, rice, salad, just about anything that you can think of. Let your imagination go wild! This is a great product. :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I just feel obligated to mention that since this product is essentially just a biotin supplement, you're basically paying 3x what you should be for a brand name. You can get regular biotin supplements for much cheaper at almost any drugstore, and it works exactly the same."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,Package was very instructional.Haven't used it full time but has a lot of good weight loss materials.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I love these bottles! They have been used everyday for 18 months and are still going strong with baby #2. They have been thrown by my toddler on our hardwood floors practically daily and I have never had one to break or chip. I put breastmilk in the freezer in them- leave enough room at the top for expansion and then allow to thaw in fridge or bring to room temp under tap before heating in bottle warmer and you are good to go. They fit right on to my medella pump. I would suggest buying their silicon nipples to go with the bottles- they come with latex and I am not a big fan of latex for baby bottles. I feel grateful to have found this as an alternative to chemical leaching plastics!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"A fine herbal extract. Natural energy,a healthy way for that get up and go. Great taste. There are many different Mg. strengths, try them all!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"Pre-Seed is a wonderful pesonal lubricant, i love to used it cause it feel so natural."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,The best massage I have ever had. No back pain after first massage. Two days a small back pain but after masage no pain .. Uses it only I need it. It's great.
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I love this organizer! It fits perfectly in my cabinet and makes it so easy to organize baby's Take & Toss cups and bowls (and lids). And when I bought it, I didn't even know it came with the 7 oz. cups and sippy lids. Bonus! I thought it was just the organizer. Don't expect the other cups and bowls to be in there, though. You have to buy those separately."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"This pasta has a wonderful natural flavor and is naturally high in fiber and nutrients. I eat it plain sometimes, and use it in place of white rice and other more processed grains."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,3.0,"These pickles contain so much sugar I was convinced they were bread and butter pickles until I carefully re-read the description. According to the label, there is more sugar than vinegar, in fact more sugar than anything else but cucumbers. Nevertheless I did enjoy them, but I'm not sure I'll order them again.As a connoisseur of hot foods (especially pickled ones), I found them hot enough to have a definite and lingering bite, though not hot enough to make my eyes tear. I'd probably call them a medium on a Texas scale, beyond hot on the New England scale."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My milk was slowly diminishing and I read that fenugreek helps. I works, just taking 2 tablets 3x's a day and I can now nurse with an abundunce of milk. 1 happy customer, thanks."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"When I've got a cloud over my mood, I take one or two of these capsules, and in about 20 minutes, I can feel the cloud dissipate. It really helps, and I'm glad to have an alternative to medication that is effective."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,great price/organic/no oil or salt/ I ave been eating this popcorn for years and love it. The price is great in the health food store they charge $3.99/box. I purchased the case here for 12 boxes for under $30. What a savings. will be ordering more cases. It pops the whole bag with only i or 2 kernels unpopped. Great.................
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We used these when our son was a baby and now our daughter is big enough for the restaurant high chair, I am using them again. They stick firmly, are colorful for baby and more importantly, prevent bite size bits of food from touching the table surface where who knows what germs lurk."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"If you are a beginner, seriously think twice about using this as you would a tabasco or any type of louisianna hot sauce.. After having this sauce, those seriously don't even feel like they have any spice at all. Take the top of your finger, touch it to the top of the bottle, and your mouth will be burning for at least 10 minutes. This sauce has a great flavor, and really meshes well with other sauces / foods. I enjoy it thoroughly!! (It's really good on pizza :))"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I find that cytomax works very well as a recovery drink after hard workouts. I live in florida, and in the summers it helps me recover quicker than gatorade. Also, the price is much cheaper than at the local health store.Good deal all around."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,They do help. It is not a cure but it dose allow me to sleep next to my wife and not get hit during then night. It comes out to about $.30 a night which is not bad.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Ilove this oil, I have had a lot of complements on it. I mixed it with some vanilla oil & it smells great.I will be buying it again in the future.Thank you,Wendy"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Good stuff. A great buy at the 5 lb size. Mixes easily with water. I use cold water and love it. Be careful reading the labels. I had bought one of their other whey products and it was sweetened with sucralose which is a poison. The natural versions are sweetened with stevia.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,3.0,"not bad, but i prefer ZICO coconut water. vitacoco seems to have a bit of an odd after taste, IMO."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I've had HomeMedics and Conaire and several other brands, and I've been very disappointed in all of them. But the Wahl vibrates right down to the bone and gets to the source of the trouble. For half the cost of an hour with a masseur, you can pleasure yourself for hours! Highly recommended."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I have been on and off Xenical before Allis is available. I was on Xenical because it really works, I was off because it was expensive.Now comes the Alli - available at the counter & prx is affordable! Yeah!I tried most of the diet pills/plans on the market for the past 3 years - some gave me headaches, some gave me stomach pain, some made my heart beats really fast, some make me to have diaherra....every sort of side effect you can imagine. Bottom line is - there is no magic to lose weight. If you are on diet pills/plan - one still has to exercise and watch out what you eat. I believe it is a fair statement.For the side effect - I'd suggest use a panty liner rather than finding spots of orange oil/grease on your panties. I prefer to spend money to buy panty liner rather than taking other diet pills which give me tons of side effect.If you have been trying so many other diet pills - why not give this a try?"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"It definitely has a different feel than water based lubes, so if that's what you are used to this might be a shock. But a little goes a long way and it does last thru long sessions. I haven't tried it with toys yet so we'll see."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,5.0,"The boys at Tuscan were not kidding around when they made this milk. Unfortunately for me, the UPS man cannot resist temptation...Needless to say, well he drank my tuscan milk...I was so outraged that I gave him the patended ""Tuscan slap""...I had avenged my lost tuscan milk, but the fight was not over. I had to re-order, but this time I took matters into my own hands, I went to the loading dock...This was my downfall, so enticed by Tuscan Whole Milk 1 Gallo 128 fl oz.'s mystery, I broke open the box and drank the whole jug right then and there...I fell to my knees as the last drip came out of my mouth, I was not strong enough, I broke out in tears later followed by an infuriating rage I had to have more, after this it got a little hazy. What I would do to taste that milk once more, I WOULD DO ANYTHING--anything....any-thing. It's all over now, the milk, the story, nothing left but...but nothing. God Bless Tuscan Milk may the heavens shine down upon ye forever. I will allways love tuscan milk."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,"When trying to get my son to transition from bottle to sippy cup we bought this one first. What a mistake. He never really sucked on it, he would chew on it to get his water out. And he would push the spout down almost inside-out causing the rest of it to sink in and then it would leak all over the place."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"A ""dessert"" I like:Pero, sweetener, ricotta cheese...Another way to enjoy the nice flavor of Pero."

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,This was the first test I took that was able to detect the hormone! I found out days before my period was even due!
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"These were a bit different to the test I was use to getting at the grocery store. You have to use a cup to do the tests, but I just kept a stack of disposable cups in the bathroom with the strips and it worked out fine. I did get PG with the ovualtion test!!!! Due in April!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,1.0,"This item contains Stevia and Erythritol, which are not on the ingredient list!!! Beware that this product is also not eligible for return."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"The microlife spirometer and peak flow meter is the only one I have found on the market that not only measures the flow, but stores the results.My husband is battling COPD which manifested itself as a residual to major surgery which required a lengthy period on a ventilator. He is progressing well now, and the peak flow meter is a great tool for measuring his progress."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I USED THIS WONDERFUL SPRAY FOR 3 MONTHS AND IT HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE. I HAVE TENDERITIS IN MY RIGHT ELBOW THAT LEFT MY ARM WEEK AND UNABLE TO BE OF USE..AND AT TIMES I COULD NOT LIFT UP A SMALL BOTTLE OF MILK. I HAVE NOT ONLY LIFTED HEAVY ITEMS BUT HAVE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN THAT I EVER HAD A PROBLEM..I PREVIOUSLY HAD SHOTS INTO THE ELBOW BUT IT NEVER WORKED LIKE YOUR PRODUCT..NO MORE SHOTS.THANK YOU DR. FRANK.MARIANNE DOOLEYNO. EASTON, MASS."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,This adds plenty flavor without salt. This product is good for those with high blood pressure and those who do not want to get high blood pressure in the future. We put this one on our salads. It adds just the right flavor.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,Our family of 4 loves this product. This is my second bulk purchase of crunch-n-munch. Good value for the money too.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"I really like spicy food, so when a friend got this for me as a gift, I was thrilled. I love it! Use EXTREME caution when adding it to food, though--just two or three little drops will add a really nice kick to a big bowl of soup. A little goes a loooooong way. I can tell I'll be enjoying this product for a long time to come.It's got a nice garlicky aroma, but unfortunately, not much of the garlic flavor comes through in the food, since you have to use so little at a time. The texture is very thick. It's very easy to add to saucy foods like chili, stir-fry, or stew, but it may be difficult to add as a condiment to burgers or sandwiches. I'd recommend mixing it in with something milder first."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This little can packs an antioxidant punch and is THE beverage for the morning after!!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,Plenty of room compare to a standard baby dishwasher basket. Made in the USA which means alot in recent weeks with Chinese recalls. Even bought the toddler basket for when my son uses sippy cup. No complaints.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I recommend Luna Bars to anyone, and have enjoyed the product for some time. However, I do not recommend buying it through the mail, as the last two times I have done so, the bars have arrived in an unsatisfactory state. Both times, it was obvious that this food product was exposed to enough heat to get the bars to melt to the point that they are miscolored and misshapen. I don't know whether the shipment of food like this could be done better, but I will be returning to the good old grocery store for these."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,"I love the other Kashi hot cereal, so I bought the Vanilla with great confidence -- only to be completely disappointed! It has little to no texture, it is very bland, and it gums up very quickly even with more than the reccommended amount of water. I originally bought Kashi because prepackaged oatmeal is overly sweet -- this is not sweet at all. I also found it to be too creamy. If you're looking for an excellent hot cereal, try the Kashi Cinnamon and Honey."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,I bought this unit a little over a year ago and used it with other massage units around the body. I actually did not feel much of anything from this unit. It does not seem to be powerful enough to really massage the scalp. The only thing I got from this unit was a circle of little red bumps around the front of my head that take about an our to disappear where one of the massage sensors go.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"Oh do these taste good! They are sweeter than I thought they would be, it's a thick coating and very dessert-like. They are a bit too gooey (sticky?) and can catch on your teeth. It is a true pecan pie flavor, even a bit artificial tasting. Don't know if I'd order again. I'm enjoying them but am aware of the sweetness/stickiness each time. Like the walnuts much more!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"We bought these bottles for our six month old solely because they are free of bisphenol-A. As it turns out, they're great bottles in their own right.Pros:* They don't leak (unlike Dr. Brown's), even when resting upside down in a bag.* Easy to hold. I was put off by the large circumference but as it turns out our son has an easier time gripping the BornFree than smaller bottles.* Easy to clean.* Venting system actually works.Cons:* Price. If concern over bisphenol-A someday turns out to be a false alarm, I'm going to feel pretty silly spending this much per bottle (nearly $10).* Size. The large circumference is a trade off. While it does make the bottle easier to hold, it means you can store fewer bottles in a small bag.Also, be aware that the nipple is very large. It's fine for a six month old, but for an infant who's still learning to breast feed you might need to look elsewhere.Overall we're very happy with the BornFree bottles."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I was a little skeptical about this product as I'm not looking to get huge muscles (the name ""Muscle Milk"" almost stopped me from using it)... but it got good reviews and my friends like it, so I thought I'd try it.First off, this stuff tastes great! I don't even feel the need to use milk, I just blend it with ice and water. It's more than enough to keep me full between meals or curb hunger post-workout. I'm not sure about the ""muscle building"" properties but I was able to lose weight and inches by substituting Muscle Milk for sweets -- so, at the very least it's a good way to get my chocolate fix without completely derailing all my hard work at the gym."
health personal care,health care,allergy,4.0,"We purchased this item for my husband who has nasal allergies. It really helps him and reduces his snoring. But, the first one we purchased just stopped working and we have had to buy another. They should be more durable."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,5.0,"These are wonderful! Great strawberry flavor, no aftertaste. The label states that it takes 30 minutes to get the the full effect, boy is that the truth! These truly keep you satisfied through the afternnon doldrums at 90 calories with six grams of protien and fiber."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I had been stuck on the Cranberry Apple Cherry for a while but the Blueberry Crisp is perfect. I'm about to buy a case of them. I tend to eat them for breakfast when I am late for work, or take them for lunch if I don't have time to make it the night before. So why this flavor? First of all, it has whole almonds in it, which I find add a satisfying crunch to the chewy bar. Also, with some of the other fruit bars, the distinct fruit flavors don't come out, it's more a ""fruity flavor"" in general. But blueberry is the overwelming flavor in this bar, without a doubt.On a health-related note:To all those reviewers who are complaining about the fat and sugar content"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The medication I take for my lupus had my stomach chronically upset. I was literally taking Pepto Bismal or Zantac everyday. I have been using Primal Defense for over a year and I no longer have stomach issues. For me, this supplement has been simply amazing."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have been buying the Jeremiah's Pick for quite some time. The beans are always fresh. The Fogbuster, in particular, has a great full-bodied, slightly acidic roast. It definitely gets me started in the morning!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,If you follow correct method of preparing (let this tea in boiling water for 10-15 minutes) this will taste great.Better place to buy this is go to nearest Indian store they generally sell 1 lb in USA for around 2.99$ only. Not sure why it is overpriced online.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts. However, the unit description is incorrect. It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars."
health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,"I love these bars and use them as meal replacements (with a piece of fruit) when I'm busy. I like the chewy crunchy texture of Luna bars. These are my favorite protein bars and I think they taste a little better than Balance Bars. This flavor won't taste like an Oreo, but it is chocolate-y and has a creamy coating.I ordered these in July and they melted in shipping, so some of the coating is stuck to the wrapper instead of on the bar, so the taste was affected a bit.Yummy treat, just be careful ordering in warm weather..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good, but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"This ugly conversation piece is a life saver. Although you may want to keep it at home and not at your desk, as it won't fit in a drawer, and is bound to initiate more discussion than you want to make about the benefits of trigger point therapy.But for the many of us who suffer from shoulder tension and the resulting hand and arm numbness, a quick pull on this tool can get you back to sleep or work as the case may be.Well worth the expense"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,I loved this bargain purchase. These crackers were fresh and tasty. I received 100 packs of these crackers and the quantity was VERY filling. These 0.9 ounce bags are PERFECT sized for lunches or snack time for adult OR child. Not small at all! I am very pleased.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I purchased this primarily to add a little extra ""oomph"" to my smoothies, especially those I was using as meal replacements (breakfast) instead of snacks. It is undetectable in the drinks as far as texture goes -- it dissolves completely. It is terrific at adding the chocolate flavor you crave. I thought it would taste like I added fake cocoa mix to the smoothie, but it created an authentic chocolate flavor -- not too strong, not too faint. Plus, it looks like the size will last through a lot of smoothies. Furthermore, this brand was a great bargain while retaining the amount of protein I was looking for."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I saved $15 by purchasing from Amazon. The protein powder makes a glass of milk taste like a delicious vanilla milkshake.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We are generally satisfied with this high chair cover, even though it doesn't always stay in place with a wiggly baby. It certainly makes the high chair more comfortable and a better fit for smaller babies. We use this one at home, if it goes on sale again we might get another for travel."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,4.0,"nutritionally can't beat it, and the taste is pretty good, i'll be buying this again when i finish off the case!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I was a fairly long time user of this product and loved it because it was effective and, I thought, safe for extended use. Then I went for my first colonoscopy and was told by my doctor that I had Melanosis coli which is caused by using products with senna and cascara sagrada bark. She said that, if I didn't stop using the product, she would not be able to see anything on the lining of my colon due to the pigmentation changes. I have never seen anything about this in the product information and have now stopped using the product."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I was suffering from a hip problem that did not allow me to bend over and after 12 days at the chiropractor, a doctor visit which included a cortisone shot in the joint and heavy pain medication I decided to try Joint Care. After using Joint Care for 5 days most of the pain is gone and I can bend over. Glucosomine in the pill form upsets my stomach and Joint Care liquid does not. I mix it with a full glass of water and it has no aftertaste."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I recommend these bars to all my female clients; they are fabulous suplements for those on the go, who are also training. As someone who is nearly 50, I know, from personal experience, the importance of supplementing my body with food nutrients, so that I can maintain energy levels that I took for granted in my 30's."
health personal care,health care,women s health,3.0,"I started taking this product about one month ago, So far I have not gotten pregnant but my period is regular again just after a few weeks of taking it. I will probably buy another bottle to see if it actually helps to get pregnant and not just regulate my period."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I bought this as an easy snack to take on the road for my toddler. She eats these instead of fruit snacks full of sugar so it's a good snack for her. Our whole family likes them. Obviously they don't taste like sweet candy, like most fruit snacks, though."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,I worked as a flight attendant for four years-- these cookies are addictive! I've never tasted anything quite like them... kind of like a rich creme brulee in cookie form. Delicious... especially dunked in a hot beverage. Haven't completed my order yet through Amazon so not certain of the packaging... but worth trying!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I spent a few weeks in Peru and loved the Coca Tea. I brought some back with me and was bummed that I was almost out. But then I found Amazon has it and life is good again. Coffee gives you the jitters and caffeine actually strips you body of vitamins, none of this with Coca Tea. In truth the Coca Leaf has proteins, vitamins and minerals essential to your body. Ingesting the leaf is NOT addictive and is in fact very healthy. It is a bit expensive but ones health is worth it. Besides the Tea tastes wonderful without side effects like upset stomach, jitters, etc. of caffeine!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,A great product to increase your energy & help build your immune system at the same time .....
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"My husband loves these things on his long bike rides. Amazon's price was significantly lower than any local stores , plus the stores were always out of stock."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"You need to use distilled water w/ these. The flavor is not the best if you use tap water. Even w/ purified and distilled water, NOT the best flavor. However, super quick to make in the morning for a single cup. Do not toss out your high end coffee maker and bean grinder. For the morning, or for the one person at a get togeather who wants coffee, yes, not bad."
health personal care,health care,unknown,3.0,"These plugs do a great job of insulating the excessive noise of power tools, lawnmower, etc. They are not comfortable for long duration. They could not be worn to bed as they stick out too much.I did not like how loosely the strap fits into the plugs. They actually arrive with the strap disconnected from the plugs. The strap has hardened endings (like shoe laces) that one is expected to insert into the ear plugs."
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"High Fidelity Ear Plugs/filtersI play the trumpet in several bands and when I get stuck in front of the percussion section (particularly snare drums), earplugs are a necessity. I own a half dozen types of plugs, and they all block the sound, but they also muffle and distort it. These plugs simply lower the volume with a minimum of the muffling effect, so they are perfect for musicians in loud groups. Very comfortable, quick & easy to insert or remove.They also seem perfect for concerts. For example, when Arturo Sandavol, the trumpet virtuoso, appeared locally, he used what must have been a 10,000 watt sound system. These ear plugs allow you to enjoy the music when a clueless sound engineer turns the volume three clicks past painful.Note"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other ""healthy"" cookie or pastry-bar type treats"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,It's hard to find this flavor in my area. I find it to be fast to cook and tasty too!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I really enjoy these bars. They are filling, not overly sweet, have a good amount of protein, but still have the chocolate taste I love. They also do not have any milk products in them, which I try to avoid, and that is difficult to find with chocolate. This is not a good bar for low calories though, so check the label. I would recommend buying a single bar at a local store to make sure you like the taste before you buy so many, but this is a better price than in any store I have found."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"The cooling wallet was a life saver for traveling with my insulin. TSA had no problems with the cooling envelope and it kept my insulin cool for all of my flights. Small enough to fit in my purse, this was a great buy."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I used to get blood sugar rushes daily, especially after a few hours up in the morning, before starting to take this product. Diachrome is something I take every AM. It has made a difference in my carb type cravings too."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,Only con is that the detachable tray is very easy to detach and my toddler pull it out all the time and throws it on the floor; hence limiting it's usefulness. they should improve design by creating some sort of child-lock or somthing.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"The true dose is only revealed by adding the EPA and the DHA. One softgel has 216 mg of EPA and 144 mg of DHA. So, one softgel has 360 mg of helpful fish oil and the remaining 840 mg is filler fish oil.When comparing fish oil, look at the back panel supplement facts. Add the EPA and DHA to get the true MG and make sure you look at the serving size. Nature made has 2 softgels per serving size, so you must divide by 2 to get the per softgel info.Twin Labs Mega appears to have the highest combo"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This is great, warms up bottles and fodd in 4 minutes at the right temperature.... GREAT"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Since my husband brought this coffee back from Costa Rica we haven't bought any other kind. It is truly delicious, smooth and no bitterness whatsoever. You will not be disappointed and you will be hooked as well.JTH from GA."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"The first wearing was difficult, as warned by the instruction, but then it gets much easier, and my toes are so much relaxed after each wearing, I look forward to using it each evening before bed."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I cannot believe this product!I got mine just yesterday, have only used it three times and I am ALREADY noticing a difference!I was suffering from a cold from the seasons changing and decided to give this a try.I HIGHLY recommended the neti pot to ANYONE and EVERYONE who has sinus problems."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This has saved me and my husband a lot of bickering. I get cold at night and he gets hot. Well, he hasn't be asking me to turn on the AC half as much since we got this for him."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"I have tried the demo version of this product in stores and thought it was great. I was happy with the price I found on Amazon, so bought it, but am more than a little dissatisfied with the product I got. I was supposed to get new, but what I received was obviously opened and unpacked previously. I set it up exactly per instructions, but the motor seems to strain, and it sounds sort of sick. The massage is poor, and does not even go up to my shoulder blades, so misses the entire top of my back. I don't know if I got a dud or if it is just not as good as I anticipated. I am really disappointed and would not recommend it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,These were the worst berries I have ever tasted and they left a funny after taste in your mouth.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is great tasting tea! I'm normally a black tea drinker and not fond of too many flavored teas, but I am hooked on this one! This is a great refreshing replacement for sodas."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"Obviously microwavable rice won't have the same quality as freshly steamed rice, but this comes close enough for me. It's very convenient for when you're at college and don't want to eat icky campus food. Just microwave this, add some microwavable Indian Food, and you're good to go"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"We always take Green Vibrance first thing in the morning. It's full of vitamins, cleans you out and increases one's energy level. I recommend this drink to anyone looking to stay healthy.pepper"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I have spent the last 3 and a half months spending loads of money on the three lac plus all the supplements recommended by the GHT company (enzymes, oxygen, colostrum, etc) and am no better off than I was when I started, except for out a lot of money!! In fact, after a few months on the 3-lac, I started to have terrible diarrhea which is just now subsiding after being off for 3 weeks. AND my yeast infections have NOT gone away at all!!! I am very happy for those who found relief in the products, but I wonder how many others like me ended up with more GI distress and continued yeast!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,Excellent quality product - it's great to have a healthy alternative when you've got the munchies. Just one thing to keep in mind - be careful not to burn/scorch as there is no salt or oil to mask your inattentive microwaving. I use one of many commercially available dry spice/herb mixes to add a ton of salt/fat-free flavor to this product. Even my salt/fat addicted friends admit this can be a real yummy healthy alternative.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,5.0,"I am addicted to this stuff! It's excellent by itself, but even better on a salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and some bleu cheese. Can't be beat!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,Some years ago my physician suggested I start taking Super Digestaway for my digestion problems. I've been taking it ever since and have never regretted it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I love this product, I tried the Mixed Berry it was great. After drinking this product I felt full, and no cravings for hours an it was really convenient."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"If you're looking for a less expensive version of Isqueeze, I'd recommend getting the Legs Beautician. A great gift idea. Anyone would love this! The only thing I wish it had was have rollers underneath move up and down to massage the soles of the feet - I don't think the Isqueeze has that as well. That aside, it's fantastic! It never fails to get a dreamy, relaxed look from anyone who's using it. This is feet and leg heaven, ladies and gentlemen.The delivery took a week. Delivery time should've been shorter. The company managed to pull through by delivering on the very day of the birthday party. I was getting nervous. I had to keep following up. Now, all is well."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,4.0,"This cookie hits just the right note for lemon lovers. Not too sweet, with a nice tangy flavor and no bitter or ""artificial"" taste.It does have a granular texture from the brown rice flour, but that does not mean this is a dry cookie at all. It sort of melts in your mouth."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"The pretzel sticks are ""starchy"" tasting (just like all other pretzels), but with just a little bit of sweetness to make them delectable. They're not salty at all, which is good--I personally don't want the extra sodium. Every once in a while eating these you get a punch from the taste of sesame seeds which make these pretzel sticks that much better."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I'm not using this for work, just for home use between my wife and myself. So far we used it twice and it's easy to setup, wide enough, and seems to be very sturdy. Face pillow is comfortable."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"My kid loves it and I love it. He is thrilled to be closer to the table with us. However there is a lef on the table that hits one of the brackets so we have it a little cockeyed, but it still does the job. Taking off the cover is a bit of wrestle, but it does clean easily once it's off. Also, I'm really glad it has a buckle to keep my kid in it until I'm ready to help him out. Great product!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I experienced a noticeable difference in endurance and recovery. The taste is far better than I had anticipated.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"Been chomping a lot on these yummy flax crackers lately... and they are really good aside from being good for you. The only carbs in these are soluble fiber from the flax, which is soaked and then lo-temp dehydrated along with veggies and sea salt to form the final cracker.This flavour (Mexican Harvest) is the best I've tried so far... I've also tried the Italian, and that is far more subtle. The texture is very crunchy and dry... it's good to drink a lot more water when eating these.I will definitely buy these crackers again, will get more Mexican and try the Maple next time as well. Health-wise and taste-wise, can't beat 'em."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I use the tray in conjunction with the Bumbo chair to feed my 6 month old. It works very well for this and she also likes to sit in the chair with the tray on and play. The only down side to this is that she throws the toys on the floor so I am continuously picking them up.The tray does take some work to get on the chair as the chair is very flexible and if I don't get it on properly my daughter is able to lift it off. That would be the only disadvantage that I see, but I love the chair and the tray has made it that much better."
health personal care,health care,women s health,2.0,This is the first product I used when I first became bothered with constant hot flashes. It seemed to work fine. Then about a year later the hot flashes began to re-occur. I was still taking the product but it was obviously not working for me anymore. I switched products (to Estroven) and I'm hot flash free again.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I bought my 90 capsules on Monday. I am now on day three. So far, I am happy.I know that if I eat anything FATTY that I will experience the side effects! Duhhhhhhhhhh!!! It doesn't curb your appetite, race your heart-none of the things you expect from a diet pill.Once you eat something fatty-expect to go to the bathroom. You don't want to soil yourself-THEN EAT RIGHT!I am using this as a jumpstart, not a CURE. Monday I ate what I wanted. Yesterday I felt bloated. I ran back and forth all early morning today to the toilet.(3am est) Stomache is still bubbling, but I have a handle on it.It's pretty simple"

health personal care,health care,foot care,3.0,"Good price, good product. Howver, it is generic and if you really need orthotics, best to have them individually fitted. These are a good value."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,Product was delivered in a timley manner. Boxes were packed very well and no boxes were crushed or damaged when they arrived. I will definitly order this product through Amazon.com again.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"this is the essential oil of choice at my house. it is a superior blend of flax and borage oils with primrose oil in the mix. excellent for providing EFA's with out the adverse flavor of cod liver oil. a great flax oil smoothie is apple juice, blueberries, a banana, soft tofu or protien powder and a tablespoon of flax oil. we have used this product for years. keep refrigerated."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Pycnogenol was recommended to me not as an anti-oxident, but for joint pain. Glucousomine/Chondroydin was not working, so I tried Pycnogenol from GNC and got great results. Knowing I wanted to continue the supplement, I looked to Amazon for the most cost-effective brand, and found Source Naturals. It works as well or better, and with Amazon's scheduled replenishment program, the cost is even lower, and I don't have to worry about running out."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"I mixed the powder and milk, and then added frozen bananas and strawberries to cover the taste of the vanilla powdered drink. Someone else had recommended it- I found it *totally* disgusting! And, it smells awful. Won't be using the Slim Fast again! Gross."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"As someone who has struggled with over-eating for years, I specifically wanted to find a pill that would take away my desire to constantly be eating. Slimquick has made me literally forget to eat. At the end of the day, I have had to force myself to eat because I realize I have only taken in around 400-500 calories. I am not following the diet plan they include, by the way.I also have way more energy than I ever have. I only take one pill a day because I never have caffeine and my body cannot handle more than the amount in one pill. Maybe as my body adjusts I will start taking the recommended dose.If you are looking for a good appetite suppressant and something to give you energy, this is a good choice. I would recommend going to the Slimquick website to research the product and reading the label carefully before you begin. I had to wait to take it until I had some health issues cleared up."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,5.0,"Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries,Frosted Strawberry are so good.I've been buying them for years.I'd tell anyone to buy and eat these.Heated up with a glass of milk....HEAVEN."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,A perfect snack for those of us who have food intolerances and are concerned about the foods we eat. Yummy yummy and easy on the tummy.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,1.0,"Terrible, terrible. bought two boxes with 24 in each box. One of the 24 packs was stale."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have had this cake mix before and when I made it for a work potluck with cream cheese frosting....everyone LOVED it! I told them it was simply a box cake mix and several joked that I shouldn't have told :) I have been looking for this cake mix ever since. When a dozen people drop their jaws and tell you how fabulous of a cook you are, well, you tend to remember that moment. The previous reviews/reviewers obviously did not understand or look at the description. The $32 is for 12 boxes and is in line with other hard-to-find foods from this vendor. Amazon simply acts as a third party to market and make it more available. Yes, the prices are higher than Wal-mart, but a lot of these foods you can hardly find anywhere anymore."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"These are great to carry in your purse or backpack. I love Agave Nectar in hot and cold tea. It dissolves totally, and has a wonderful taste. It's low glycemic to boot!Two Thumbs up!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"Jeremiah's Kona Blend is a good tasting, middle of the road coffee bean. While not as flavorful as J's Fogbuster, the Kona is light and mellow, offering a nice change of pace for dark roast drinkers. I brew in a french press most mornings, but when I ran it through a drip machine for company the flavor became too slight. Be prepared to grind a lot of beans if you brew drip. Overall a good pick and a good value."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"Disappointing. Healthy Choice is usually great - this was doughy and had a very cloudy, flouring taste to the broth. Hardly any veggies."
health personal care,health care,allergy,3.0,"I do not like medicating my child but during allergy and cold season, I do not like her being miserable either. Claritin doesn't work for me, and for my daughter, it only works for 12 hours. I feel bad about this because after 12 hours the sniffling, and itchiness of throat comes back. Benadryl acts quickly but I can only use that at night. And not until the 24 hours is up for the Claritin. I am taking her to the pediatrician to see what they can suggest for good allergy relief. I have read up on medications and I do feel that these two meds, benadryl and claritin are low key meds, as in no adverse side affects or anything that causes alarm."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Organic Food Bars are fantastic they provide you with a host of important vitamins and minerals. However, they are not your typical crunchy, hard to swallow, food bars. They are moist and delicious sweetened with all organic sugars. Great Buy, excellent service, and quick shipping. Thanks for this wonderful meal or midday snack."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,3.0,"This is $2.50 per jar at my local grocery store. No bargain here considering I'm forced to buy a 12 pack. For the record, all the ingredients in this product occur in nature, thus it is Natural. For people who want our Peanut Butter to taste like Peanut Butter and still not have chemicals, this is a great product. Just don't buy it here if you want a bargain."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"Tasty stuff, but as I said, in the title, a little too sweet. It's actually a nice feature (I think) that they are such small cans -- 8 oz. is a nice little shot. A bit expensive, even on sale -- worked out to nearly a dollar a can."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,This is a very nice deep tissue cream however I was hoping for even less glide for more effective myofascial release.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Literally, changed my quality of life. I never had heartburn until I gave birth. I first used Pepcid (which worked for awhile) but was up to 2 extra strength a day. I finally got an upper GI and found out I had Level 2 reflux. They put me on this and immediately I was 'cured'. I was no longer waking up at night, didn't have to sleep with an elevated head and could eat later if I wanted to. I wish I had found this years ago. I've recommended it to other people I know and they thank me. It really not only helps the immediate effects of reflux, it will in time, repair the damage."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have been using Prossage in my massage practice since I discovered it a couple of years ago. In addition to using it during therapy sessions, I also recommend it to my clients to use between sessions to reliever pain and soreness. Amazon had the best price and it was delivered on time as promised in good condition."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"First introduced to this product during a hospital visit. Great product, especially for sensitive skin."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"The basic function of this unit works well, and is a welcome relaxation at the end of a long day. However, the neck massager is cranky and the foot massagers flop around in the way. This unit would be preferable with just more aeration pads, but it is usable and worth the price."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,5.0,"Guys ... if you like Grape then you need to try Wild Berry. It tastes just the same. Here is the trouble ... Kelloggs has also now discontinued the Wild Berry as well. Amazon is out.They are still out with some distributors. But when those are gone, they are gone. Look for the Mom & Pop grocery stores or the ""rich"" grocery store in your area. Dropped in there yesterday and bought up the last six boxes they had. Use By date is June 2008 so the last batch will be good until at least then.Oh, one more thing ... someone said the Hello Kitty poptart seems to be about the same as the Wild Berry except the frosting is pink colored. So if you see those, give them a try too."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After turning 40 and having a job that required alot of knee bending and knee stress I noticed my knees did not feel as good as when I was 25 so I began taking this supplement. Wow, my knees began to feel young again and my mood and sleep became better, and my movements seem more like when I was younger also. Highly recommend."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have dry eyes chronically after having lasik eye surgery 7 years ago. I have to use lubricating eye ointment nightly to avoid very painful ""corneal erosion"". I have found no downside to using Paralube compared to all the other ointments that cost 3-5 times the price. Why make the drug companies rich? Just use this good generic brand. I highly recommend Paralube for equal effectiveness at a low price!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,I discovered these beans about a year ago and have not bought another brand since. They are really good in other food or simply by themself. If you haven't tried them you must.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"this is the best brown sugar I've consumed in a long time. It reminds me when I was a kid and put the dark brown sugar that was made with molasses on my oatmeal. It definetly reminded me of my chilhood in the good old days. you will not be disappointed in this product, I highly recomend it"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"Contrary to what has been suggested, Twinings is NOT the original Earl Grey recipe. It finds its origins in an attempt to replicate the flavour of the original. It is very likely that Jacksons of Piccadilly are justified in their claim that the recipe they use is that given to one of their directors by the Earl himself in 1830. Twinings is a strange blend of teas from various South Asian countries and regions, with the addition of bergamot flavouring. Frankly, the Waitrose own brand is a much finer tea, and closer to the original recipe, too."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,1.0,"I strongly agree w/the reviewer who suggested trying a single serving of this before ordering a case. I had read great things about the benefits of coconut water but I found both the taste and the consistency to be extremely unpleasant. I will usually persevere in the name of good health but I simply couldn't stomach this stuff. When I need electrolytes, I'll continue to use water + Emergen-C."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,5.0,"It came in the mail promptly. Very secure packaging. And it was a great bargain. Red Bull is expensive anywhere you buy it. But Amazon, by far has the best Deal!! Thanks."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,3.0,"There are to things I really like to snack on and that's, Jerky and Spicy Stuff. Believe it or not, these beef stick's have a little spice to them(not a lingering spicy).The reason I gave these a 3 of 5 STARS, is because I make my own Beef and Deer Jerky and although these Jalapeno and Cheese are something different and tasty, they come nowhere close to my awsome homemade jerky made from steak, not ground beef part's such as (beefheart)."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"based on the number of pills I have to take each day,I had a need for a second one, but it seems that they are no longer available except through Amazon.I trust that my pill count will not increase.it is the right size and features- - - - perfect !"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Use probably 3 - 4 days a week for a blended breakfast drink with some fresh fruit and frozen yogurt. Great!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,The product is phenomenal but i will never buy supplements from Amazon again. by the time it got here i had paid seven bucks for the shipping of the real vendor that supplies to amazon!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,This is the best protein drink ever! I had gastric bypass surgery in February of 2007 and must have 60 to 80 grams of protein daily. I drink this drink every morning and am able to take my meds and vitamins with it. I would never even trying another protein drink.
health personal care,health care,unknown,4.0,"You can find the ear wax if you unroll the candles afterwards, kinda gross though.I find it a bit challenging to do it by myself, probably a bit dangerous too. So make sure you have a partner to do it for you."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"My family loves my Dad's chestnut stuffing for Thanksgiving, but my hands can no longer handle the tight grip needed on the chestnuts to cross-cut them before cooking, nor the painstaking peeling. This product takes all that physical pain away from this task; their already being peeled means no waste as there would be in doing it by hand. Also, it saves me valuable time in the kitchen, which I can now spend otherwise, usually developing something new and special for the holiday meal. The size is also very practical - one bag is good for one-half recipe of stuffing, so I no longer have leftover peeled chestnuts I can't use. I have bought this product every year for the last 10 years; MUCH cheaper than the French and Williams-Sonoma equivalents."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,I like the ease of use for these handles. You can put them on the cup or leave them off. They are terrific for babies that are just beginning to use a cup and then when they become familiar with the cup. They can be easily removed so they will sit inside the cup holders on most of the carseats and strollers. Great product!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"I was intrigued by the prospects of Alli. Isn't it wonderful? Just take a pill and you will lose weight and look great! It sounds too good to be true and unfortunately upon further research, I discovered that it is.First of all, people lose very little weight. I found out that Alli is not a new product at all. It has been around for long time and sold by prescription. Then Roche sold the pattern to GlaxoSmithKline. Glaxo repackaged it, gave it a new name and started selling it as the new wonder drug Alli. This raised my first red flag. If the drug really worked, why would Roche sell the golden hen to Glaxo? I quickly found the answers right in the company brochure. It only blocks 25% of the fats!You can achieve this only by skipping snacks or avoiding sodas! To mask the impotency of the drug Glaxo instructs to have a healthy diet and exercise. If the drug doesn't work, you do not follow the instructions! If it works, most of the benefit may be coming from your new diet and exercise any way. Very clever!Second of all, I am really concerned about the health risks associated with the drug. In addition to the inconvenient and embarrassing well-documented side effects, I am worried that there are other long-term, more damaging risks which will start to emerge. I know that the drug was FDA approved but so was Vioxx, Ephedra and other drugs dangerous drugs. After all, this is unnatural, chemical way to lose weight. I will not be surprised if the concerns that it may cause cancer or other serious illnesses may turn to be true. I refuse to be the testing mice! I would rather go with a safer, common sense diet plan like Weight Watchers or Nutrisystem.In summary, I found that Alli is a marketing product which plays perfectly to fast gain, no pain customers. However, after I took a careful second look I saw a lot of pain and no gain."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,Essentially this product just bubbles. The bubbles don't soothe. I find no significant improvement from using a regular pan.Pros:-light weight-well designed carry handleCons:Water does NOT stay warm as advertised-bubbles only make a mess-not worth the cost
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I noticed a difference the day after I took it! My sinuses cleared up and my brain fog lifted. It's an amazing product and for everything it does for your health the price is well worth it! I want everyone I know to try it. Our digestive health is sooooooo important. I guess from other reviews that it doesn't work for everyone, but it worked wonders for me. My whole family is taking it and feeling great!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,4.0,"My husband really likes to have chips or something to munch on in his lunch, and pita chips are a good alternative to regular potato chips. I decided to buy these at Amazon.com because they are such a better price than I could find them in stores. An added bonus was that Stacy's brand is our favorite in terms of taste (compared to Trader Joe's and other store brands) but they are normally more expensive per bag, so it was nice to find them on sale. However, I will note that I bought these as part of a promo (one of those save $$ off a purchase) so I don't know if they will be as good of a deal in the future.The only downside of ordering these (and other items from Amazon grocery) is that since they come in bulk, you end up with a lot of the product at a time. I ended up with 24 bags of Pita chips total, which was a lot to find room to store!"
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,5.0,"I bought this for my son and people LOVE it! I am asked all the time where I bought it from cuz they want to get it for their grandchild, niece, nephew...ect I often think Amazon should pay me for the amount of word of mouth I have given on this product... I think if you have a sense of humor and don't see it as some slam against humanity (as some reviewer has) than you'll love it, I think if you do have a problem with it you probably aren't even bothering looking at the product page and or its reviews."
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,My 6 month old loves to eat fruits like honeydew and watermelon in this. The little cooler helps keep everything a good temperature. Most of all I don't have to worry about cutting it up. It works well as a teether too because he can gum it to death and forget that he's teething!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I bought this along with the chocolate one and both are great. The flavor is delicious. I don't even have to use a blender to make it. All I do is measure out a scoup of the powder and slowly stir in my liquid Nothing could be easier than that. I mix mine primarily with water. The flavor is so good you really don't need to mix with anything else unless you want to. I have though bought those strawberry/banana smoothie drinks you get in the produce section to vary up the vanilla. I use 1/2 cup of the smoothie and 1/2 cup water and it make for a yummy treat, great for a quick breakfast. I love getting that punch of protein without a lot of sugar. I think this product is high quality and have recommended it to my family and friends."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My order arrived quickly, and I was very happy that it came certified, so the seller knew I was the one receiving the item."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"These babies are MUCH too good for my own good. The chocolate chunks are large & made of very good chocolate, and the texture is chewy & firm. To me, they actually taste just like a really good brownie mix-- as if somebody took unbaked brownie mix & turned it into a cookie. I told myself I was going to try just one for dessert, & ended up eating the whole frigging box, only very reluctantly giving one to my friend."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I ordered this to help release trigger points on my muscles to relieve fybromyalgia symptoms. It works wonderfully, and there is no place I cannot reach with one knob or another. The two ends of the ""S"" are different. One is a ball, the other shaped more like an elbow. The two perpendicular pieces are the same way. This tool will allow me to hit any trigger point I want to with as much depth or pressure as I need. Until I am rich enough to afford my own massage therapist, this is the next best thing."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"Non irritating, greaseless gel. Works great with ultrasound massager. Extremely fast shipping. I received this practically overnight."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Boyfriend had been hinting about these bars and telling me how wonderful they were but couldn't find them anywhere. So for a ""just because"" item I thought I'd surprise him. He had been trying to find them around here but no one carried them. Only makers like krusteez or some other brand that just didn't taste right. So his face lit up when he opened the box. Thoroughly satisfied. He made some that night and they were great!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm a new omega-3 fan. My first try was a different brand - without the lemon flavor - and I had to give them away - and that person ended up throwing them out. Then I tried this brand - with the lemon flavor - and now I never get that 'fishy-tasting burp'.I'm trying this and Niacin to work on my Triglycerides, so in a few more weeks, I'll have the blood checked, and the results at that time."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,This cereal was my introduction to Kashi cereals. I like several of them but this is by far my favorite. Try it. You'll like it.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This is a product that every home needs to have. Back pain- neck aches strike all of we humans- especially as we age,These heat packs are flexible enough to be worn in a confortable manner.It would be nice IF they would stay warmer longer. And IF they were washable- it would be a great improvement!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I got the strawberry flavor. It is uber tasty, and mixes well. My suggestion:8oz Soy milk, or waterhandful of blueberries, and a small bit o ice..awesome shake for anytime."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I ordered the variety pack to try new coffee and found I liked them all. They are all wonderful tasting.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,3.0,"I love these chips but can't believe they are fried and not baked. They are rather high in calories and serving size does not mention how many chips per serving. Corazonas should be more upfront about preperation of the product and make it clear whether it is baked ot fried. Honestly, I would not have purchased this product if I know it was not baked."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola bars,5.0,"The cherry chocolate kashi bars are great, but they're a lot cheaper at my Target (2.74 a box, sometimes on sale for 2.50)."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,unknown,5.0,This is my favorite...it started dissapearing from stores until I just couldn't find it anymore. I actually crave the taste. So glad I found it again!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"This Yuban DARK ROAST is outstanding. It is smooth with a chocolaty taste. I find it as good as any far more expensive coffees. I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste. Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste. Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.Also, keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks Starbucks is far, far overrated (bitter, burnt)."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I have never used this product before, but I wanted an alternative to convetional medicine for my children when they get a cold. I have been using this product for little over a month. My children have complained of stuffy noses and complained of general aches, I gave them the sambucol and it really worked in a day or two. I will definately recommed this product to others. Thanks."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I used to buy this product at CVS, but they stopped carrying it for some reason. This three pack is a great deal for a hard-to-find product."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I am a physical therapist and I have tried many different kinds of arch supports. The Isoarches are the best! Many of my patients complain that custom-made orthotics are uncomfortable because they are too firm. However, over the counter arch supports like ones from Dr. Scholl's are too soft. The Isoarches are in between. Like anything you put your foot into or onto, it does take a few days to get used to it. They are very comfortable and give moderate support. I now sell these in my clinic."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"There's so many of these products around now, it took a while to find one that genuinely mixes well with water and still tastes creamy and delcious, while giving you the daily dose of protein. A+"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I love this heating pad. It's the best I've ever had, and I will buy a second one for my place at the couch. I keep the one I have in my bed. I find that I never need to set it above the middle setting. Otherwise it would be too hot for me. The auto shut off is a great feature, so I don't have to worry if I fall asleep with it. I have no trouble with it being slow to heat up like some of the other reviews talk about. Absolutely flawless performance, pleasant, soft, pliable and nice to use, in my opinion."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,This booster seat/high chair is an ingenious product. The tray is easy to take off (even with one hand) and put on. It adjusts to three different distances for the right fit. The dishwasher-safe removable tray element is also very helpful. Once the tray is no longer needed the high chair becomes a booster seat. Wonderful! And you don't have to buy yet another piece of baby furniture.
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,The tan strips work great stay away from the clear if you have oily skin they don't stick.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Folks, I tried Lisinopril for 5 days and vowed I would NEVER use prescribed BP meds again! Saw this and thought ""what the heck?"" ... why not try it for 3 months? I was at 168/95 to 185/100 (sometimes a little higher) by the end of the night. Now I am about 125/75 to 138/82 at the end of the night. I honestly did nothing more than take these 3-4 times/day and 2 potassium tablets from the drug store along with them. I started watching the sodium content of foods by reading labels. I had NO IDEA there was 220 mg of sodium in 1 slice of bread. Found a Nickels brand that is 110/slice. Did you know you should only have about 1500 - 2500 mg sodium/day? I also started using/cooking with AlsoSalt ... YOU CANNOT TELL it's not salt unless you taste it straight from the container or put it on foods where it doesn't get ""into"" it (where it stays in dry form). If I can do it ... you can do it! GET OFF THOSE PRESCRIBED MEDS ... MINE WAS MADE FROM SNAKE VENOM!! NO WONDER I FELT LIKE CRAP! BUY THIS STUFF ... IT WORKS!!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"If you miss homemade snickerdoodles, look no further! They were simple enough for my 10 year old daughter to make, and they are just like the cookies I remember growing up. They only trouble is they disappear way too fast."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I used to take the original Xenadrine before the FDA pulled ephedrine from the markets and I could testify that it worked like a charm. I had lost maaaad weight with it. Then I tried the EFX with some disappointment. I almost switched to Ripped Fuel's newest product when I noticed Xenadrine's Super Hard Core on the shelf right next to it.Since I tend to be a loyalist with my products, and I prefer as FEW pills a day as possible, I gave it a shot. My body's fairly robust when it comes to being affected by supplements, but I started with a single pill twice a day and it was great. Energy and appetite suppression. I've stepped up to three pills (2 early, 1 later) a day and can say my faith is renewed in Xenadrine. I haven't been this happy with them since the original formula was out. In fact, with my tendency toward acid reflux, Xenadrine Super Hard Core has IN NO WAY caused my stomach to be upset like the original formula used to do. Kudos!Of course, like any other supplement, if you've got health issues with blood pressure or history of family stroke, heart disease, or other serious health conditions, you should ALWAYS consult a physician before taking diet supplements and be sure to include daily activities and exercise for best results."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,1.0,OMG these taste AWLFUL!!!Do not buy 24 of them as you will have 23 and 1 opened pack left. I am trying to sell mine online as I HATE them.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,I have very bad back joint pain and thought this would be great. Used it for 3 weeks every day for 20-30 minutes. The heat was good but the pain was still there. Then went to return it and I did not see the 30% RESTOCKING FEE! Plus the shipping and handling to and from the seller. So there really is a not a 30 day money back guarantee. READ THE RETURN POLICY!!!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"This little sucker gets so hot. It's small and thin, but i really love this heating pad! The shape of it is great and it gets really hot, i don't think i've ever even put it on ""hot"" yet. lol"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,The product is great! Kept me from having to go back for a cortisone shot in the knee. I'll continue to order it.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I bought a jar of Bonnie's Country Classic Mustard BBQ sauce after sampling it at a local food fair called Pride of Dakota. Later that week, I used it on ribs in the slow cooker and it was absolutely delicious. I love mustard flavored things, so naturally, I love this BBQ sauce, although the mustard taste is very subtle. Even my husband loves it and he isn't usually a mustard fan. It's just the right mix of tangy, smokey, and sweet. We love it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"My husband and I love these food bars. We eat one every single day for breakfast, so I buy them quite often. The cheapest place I have found them is here on Amazon! What a great healthy snack!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"After using a homemedics machine on full volume, this machine seems quiet and doesn't drown out as much noise. But for someone not used to using anything or a newborn, it would be perfect."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Whey Gourmet makes the best protein shakes. The shakes tastes like milk shakes from a restaurant minus all the calories, carbs and sugar. Just make sure you blend it for a minute or two so all the flavor comes out."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,1.0,"I'm not sure if it's because the juice is organic, but the stuff is light brown like a spoiled lime. I've never seen lime juice any other color than light green."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,I've used Avent milk storage bags before but they leaked when accidentally tipped over in the fridge. Lansinoh milk storage bags are great because they don't tip over and have a double zipper which eliminates the need for a tie or a clip !
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I had this sent to my son at OU so he could put it on a sore throat, so I haven't seen it personally, but he says it was a great relief when it came and that it worked great! The auto-off is a neat bonus, and the price couldn't be beat at $11. We're thrilled."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,Did a decent job for about two days then the handle broke. Not well made.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,I DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS A STRONG AFTER TASTE. I WILL STICK WITH SPLENDA.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Great for high-rise dwellers who can't use open flame to grill!!. Offers the true grill taste from the broiler. Leaves meats and veggies tender, juicy and perfectly caramelized!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,4.0,"Although I prefer Lundberg's organic brown rice -- it has a more distinctive, wonderfully nutty taste -- it's hard to beat the convenience of these 36-oz jars from Amazon. I can cook a whole jar (about 5-5.5 cups) in my rice cooker, with good results. If Amazon ever starts stocking the 32-oz bags from Lundberg's, though, I'd switch."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"There are no trans fats in these chips, so consuming a bag may make you feel guilty, but it will only enlarge your butt, not your heart. They are thicker than traditional potato chips, but not too thick - they are just right and salted perfectly. These are also a great item for entertaining to put in a decorative bowl - a pop of color - a true conversation piece that is edible!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I have this messager and it has relieved my neck and back pain.It is the best Homedics version out there.Try it once and you will love it too.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,4.0,"This is a light, fluffy snack, with no oilyresidue. It seems better than most microwavedpopcorn. Salt content is not too heavy. Wouldhave given it 5*, but there is nothing likefreshly-made popcorn, from the stovetop, orfrom a popper. All microwave types that Ihave tried leave a bit of a sensation of acertain flavoring added to the corn,thus diminishing a ""pure"", authentic corn taste."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I drink three cups of this each day, made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag, in a large mug. I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months. I drink it without sweeteners, and also cold. The price for this is very reasonable, and the taste is mild."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"They WILL mess your order-up; according to whimsical business practices. My yeast was 'dead as a doornail', my bulghur was good...Another customer will state their yeast was good and their bulghur was bad. They will also substitute items notoriously."

At first i was afraid to buy preseed, i thought i was going to waste my money and, i couldnt possibly be one of those women who after trying and trying and yes trying would get a bfp after useing preseed once. Well thats exactly what happened. Try it"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I was an Avent user, until this BPA scare, that is. These bottles are excellent. Very durable! I really have no complaints, however, we did have to switch to a silicone orthodontic nipple because my 7 month old could not get the hang of the hard rubber one. For babies who have issues with swallowing too much air, just use the 4 oz. Dr. Browns vent system, with these 8 oz. Evenflo classics, problem solved! (The 8 oz. vent is a tad too long.)"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I liked the nuts very much, even gave some away as gifts. They could use a little more salt though."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to find products that meet my criteria. But I found these bars that meet it and also taste great. And on top of all I like the fact that the company donates a percentage of their profits.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,1.0,"I ordered Robert's American Gourmet Chaos, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24) on October 30th, 2007 and although it arrived quickly and in good physical condition; it was awful. I tried to return it but I was informed it is not an item you can return which has me a bit upset as it costs over $15 and is inedible. When I opened the first package I was assailed with the smell of rancid oil and so I will not be feeding these organic snacks to my children.The date on the items is not past due, so I assume it is a mistake by the manufacturer. I have ordered other of the Robert's snacks in the past and have never had this problem before, but I will be very hesitant to order any more in the future."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Perfect for your lower back. It's so relaxing! I also have the one with 2 knobs, and I prefer that on my shoulders, but this is awesome for your whole back area. Great product!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I'm a choral singer and I rely on Throat Coat to keep me healthy and singing through the holiday season and beyond. I take it any time I feel a tickle coming on, and it's done wonders for me. I happen to love herbal tea, so I find the flavor quite pleasing. It's lightly sweet with a hint of cinnamon and lemon. The herbs really do make the back of your tongue tingle in a very pleasant way. I couldn't live without it!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,"This is a wonderful product. The flavor is outstanding, and it is a healthy snack (not a common combination, unfortunately!). I also appreciate the reasonable online price and speedy delivery."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Zinc Gluconate gives you 30% of the effect of Zinc Acetate. Zinc Acetate has been tested extensively and does help to get rid of the common cold. Zinc Gluconate tastes better, but doesn't help to get rid of the common cold very well. These have Zinc Gluconate. I wouldn't buy them unless you just like the taste and don't care if they work."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I agree! As a gastric bypass patient, protein is a number 1 concern, and of the products I've tried, this is my favorite. It's breakfast everyday these days. Delicious warm in the winter and cold in the summer. If you want it a little more chocolatey you can add a teaspoon or two of Carnation Instant Breakfast, but this stuff is good as it is. I like to add it to lactose-free non-fat milk for an extra protein boost."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,"I never go on a long run without stashing some of these with my water. I prefer them cold and hardened which make them my preferred winter running refreshment. Cran-Raz is my favorte, but I also like the Strawberry. I don't care at all for the ones that contain caffine - they have a funny aftertaste.If you're going out for a run and want an alternative to GU/AccelGel/Power Gel, etc. definitely give these a try. They also work great for biking and hiking."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"Much, much cheaper than what you can get at drug stores. Accurate, and my wife is pregnant."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is great for Couscous sauce and other red sauces! I would recommend making it at home then buying it, but if you don't know how or don't have the opportunity to do it this is the brand to buy!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have had problems with yeast infections for many years. It was not until the last 3 years that my problems grew into itchy skin, foggy brain and many sinus infections. When I was on Atkins diet a few years ago, most symptoms went away, but that diet is very hard to stick with. When trying to get back to some normalcy in my diet, then the yeast infections came back. I found ThreeLac two years ago and it has greatly reduced the number of yeast infections I have. It cannot be a silver bullet that many hope for...I must watch your bread and sugar intake (including fruit). I have also found that high humidity and high stress can trigger new episodes. I don't know now long I will be on ThreeLac, but for now, it is a great product and what I need at this point in my life. I highly recommend you try it, but follow simple rules with it...stay on it for a few months...also try products that reintroduce ""good bacteria"" into your intestines and watch your diet! Good luck!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have always loved the Yogi Tea Collection and was really happy to get this Cold Season Sampler. It has all of my favorites together in one box, so that I don't have a bunch of boxes on the shelf getting old when the cold passes. Great Combination!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"I was looking for oil's for Aromatherapy. The smells this kit comes with are not for Aromatherapy. The oil samples are Eucalyptus, Peppermint (not good smells to use for your house), Tea Tree ( smells ""icky""), sweet orange, lavender, and rosemary (they smell OK)."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,We tried this the first time when we were at the Atlanta furniture market. We mail ordered it because it was so good.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"Vegan. Natural. Excellent quality. Chana dal is one of my favorites from when I lived in India & Nepal. Dal is the primary protein source for vegetarians in South Asia and can also be a great part of any vegan diet. Here is ""Greg's Flavorful Chana Dal"" recipe"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,I love the glass bottles. After hearing reports of chemicals and synthetic hormones found in plastic bottles I switched to glass only. Other bottles are easier to use. The nipples that come with these are latex and so if your baby does not use latex (which I think most don't) a better silicone nipple that fits these bottles is the Gerber NUK.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha is one of my favorite packaged teas. It has a rich, strong, and full taste. In comparison, Yamatoyama's genmaicha tastes a little burnt, and other genmaichas seem somewhat diluted. If you like the genmaicha served in Japanese restaurants, you really ought to try Ujinotsuyu's version -- you're going to love this stuff. These tea bags are strong enough for two uses (steepings).I've gone out of my way to purchase this tea. In the New York City metropolitan area, one may also find Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha in ethnic Japanese, Korean, and Chinese supermarkets, although searching may be required."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Excellent taste, great texture. Kids like it so much they take it to school as a snack. Hubby likes to take it on trips for a quick pick me up. Amazing that a protein bar can taste this good and still be half way decent for you."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,I could only find these at SuperWalmart which is about 45 min driving time. I was so happy to find them here at Amazon AND free shipping. I LOVE these Chex. Great price delivered to my door. Thanks Amazon!

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"I really wanted to like this... I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's French Onion Soup, and I love good New England Clam Chowder... but this ain't it! It is thick and pasty and really doesn't taste of either cream or clams... and is a little salty to boot.I think Progresso makes a much better product in this soup... heck, even Campbell's beats out WP's version in my opinion."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"It is hard to find coffee pods in grocery stores, so I really appreciate being able to buy these online. Having something like this shipped right to my door is wonderful. Please keep having these items available!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,1.0,"I thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for Annie's mac n' cheese, but this was not really macaroni and cheese. The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I purchased this Stevia because I wanted to eliminate the chemical artificial sweeteners in my diet. I really wanted to like this product and bough both the packets and the can. Yes, the product does sweeten whatever you put it in.... but it has an ""interesting"" taste. It is not a bad taste, but I have yet to use it again after the initial trial. If you are looking for a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar, this is not it... if you are looking for an alternative sweetener that is healthier, give it a shot!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,I had back surgery and my doctor told me to use Tegaderm to keep my sutures clean. It works wonders! I could shower as long as I wanted!! I gave it 4 stars cause I ended up getting a mild rash (i DO have sensitive skin though).

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"My son has many nosebleeds and these allow him to feel in control. It is worth the cost for lower anxiety, and free hands. No need to pinch the nose closed."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"On a few occasions since I started taking Green Tea Mega EGCG I've felt mildly nauseated afterwards, and thought it might be the pills, since drinking strong green tea on an empty stomach makes me queasy. But I can't definitively link the nausea to this product, and as long as I take them with food everything seems to be fine.Plus the manufacturer is extremely friendly, helpful and on the ball.I'm not using the supplement for weight loss, so I can't comment on effectiveness in that department, but I can report a slight buzz or energized feeling produced by the supplement, if that's helpful."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Gorilla Munch has been a real life-saver for me. Having celiac disease, I have gotten used to cereals that taste and feel like soggy cardboard. Gorilla Munch is extra crunchy, which in and of itself is like a treat, and it keeps its flavor even when milk is added, which almost never happens with gluten-free cereals. It's more affordably priced than the other gluten-free cereals on the market and is very filling, at least for me. I usually mix in a teaspoon of FiberSure to help make it a little more nutritional, and sometimes I add fresh fruit, which goes very well with it. For those who do not like the crunchiness of Gorilla Munch, I've found that using unsweetened almond milk rather than cow's milk seems to soften it up almost instantly, for some reason.I take issue with the idea that Gorilla Munch is nothing but junk being targeted at children. This cereal is marketed to children who cannot eat gluten, meaning they're mostly children who are used to food tasting terrible (those with celiac disease or wheat allergies) and children who are /positively/ stimulated by bright colors and designs (those with autism). They are already on strict diets which require that they watch their nutrient intake, so having one mostly fluff product is not going to hurt them. Children on gluten-free diets aren't exactly the ones you worry about eating doughnuts and cookies every day, and with all of the bland, soggy food we're stuck with, they deserve a treat once in a while. And with almost no other brand making fun-looking gluten-free items geared at children, it's good to have at least /something/ to look at, especially something that's educational.Additionally, EnviroKidz is a great company to support. They spread awareness about important environmental and animal rights issues through their products, they use only environment-friendly organic products, and they give 1% of their proceeds to related causes. When I have called their customer service line in the past, they have been exceptionally helpful, once even giving me a full refund for a product that was only slightly damaged. I would much rather give them my money than some of the other lines out there.In brief, Gorilla Munch is a great cereal that helps put some life back into a gluten-free diet. It's nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal again and not have to be reminded of my special diet and how restrictive it can be. Thank you, Gorilla Munch!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,4.0,"This seasoning has a spicy, yet slightly sweet (from the dried raisins)flavor.If you want something authentic tasting, you will love this!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I love the Powerbar protein bars but was worried the reduced sugar version would be nasty. These were great. I'd routinely take one to work for breakfast. It's easy to eat while working without having to leave my work area or sit down. They taste great and I'm not hungry for hours after. Unfortunately, this flavor is hard to come by."

Since I've started taking these, I haven't had a migraine since. I still do get headaches-sinus, eye, etc., that's me, but nowhere near the pain of a migraine and without losing 3 days of life at a time. Try it, it may work for you."

So, my dog runs around behind her and gets all that fall on the floor. Goldfish don't seem to spill out as easily though. It's better than an open bowl I guess."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"After having lap band surgery, I needed a low calorie, high protein supplement. I tried a couple of other brands, but Whey Matrix tasted the best. With free shipping from Amazon.com, it was also the best value for my money. The only negative is that it is kind of lumpy when mixed with a spoon, but when mixed with a blender, it is perfect."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I am currently on my second container of Gaspari's SuperPump 250. I have tried NO Xplode, a similar Nitric Oxide product.With the NO Xplode I got decent pumps and excellent focus for about the first two weeks. After time I grew more and more tolerant, to the point where 2.5 scoops was barely noticeable.I decided to switch to SuperPump, mainly because it was $15 cheaper. I'm so glad that I did. I currently take 2 heaping scoops of SuperPump with a half tsp. of creatine ethyl ester before every workout. In 20-30 minutes my head is rushing, my muscles are pumping, and I have an incredible feeling of focus and energy. I can work out harder, my muscles get incredibly pumped, and my veins grow more distinguishable. SuperPump also helps to burn fat. The best part is that the effects of SuperPump last for about 2 hours, and I still get the same if not more effect as I did on the very first day.Side Effects:-Smelly Gas every now and then-Change in stool consistency.-Drowsiness after wearing off (if you take too late at night)-Light Headedness (if you are dehydrated)Before using SuperPump there are a few things you should know.-I've only tried Blue Raspberry. It's an acquired taste but it is definitely manageable. No gagging like I did with NO-Xplode Lemon Lime-Take it on an empty stomach and don't eat or drink anything but water for at least 20 minutes after taking! Otherwise your SuperPump may turn into SuperPoop.-This is not for the casual gym goer. This is for regular, explosive workouts to put on lean muscle.-Not good for aerobic workouts. I've tried it and I feel like my muscles get too pumped. It hinders range of motion a bit and I get slightly queasy.-Start small. One scoop the first couple times. Once you get used to it up to 1.5 scoops. Then go to 2. Then if you really want to get pumped go for 2 heaping or 2.5 I have felt no need to go with 3.-It says on the package to take on off days. Don't. It's a waste of money.-Drink lots of water!-I'd recommend cycling. I do 3 months on and 1 month off, in conjunction with my creatine.If you follow those tips you should minimize side effects and get fantastic results. I will never go back to a different Nitrogen product."

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"I own/run a business. For more years than I care to admit to, my memory and time management as well as my ability to handle the ""day to day"" decisions became elusive, at best. Each year, these problems became worse and I lost much of my business because of my ADD (just diagnosed last year). My personal relationships have suffered from it as well. I turned 40 this year and decided that I couldn't live like this any longer. I have a strong aversion to prescription medication but reached a point where I would do anything to change my life, even if it meant turning to meds.I began taking Attend about a month and a half ago as a last resort before prescription meds. I am so grateful to say that Attend has worked better than I imagined. The first noticeable change occurred in just a few days after starting Attend"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I've owned the TheraCane for a little over twenty minutes now and all I can say is, WOW! It works amazingly well and it allows me to apply just the right amount of pressure myself instead of trying to negotiate with a masseuse on where to press and how much. It's great for trigger points in the upper and mid-back, and even the ones underneath the shoulder blades, which are usually impossible to get. It feels very sturdy and I'm not at all concerned about it breaking (ever). It also doesn't require much strength to apply a lot of pressure so if you're worried about that, don't. It is a little pricey but it's completely worth it. I highly recommend it!"

I suffer from sinus problems, and I have had bad sinus problems this fall (colds and allergies). I wanted to find a natural remedy because my prescription and an OTC nasal spray were just not helping me! After a co-worker mentioned nasal irrigation, I started doing research and found this product. I went to a pharmacy and found the product and begin using it. It took a few times to actually see results. Now I can breathe through my nose and my sinuses feel less irritated. I'm so happy I found this because I was tired of using medications that only work for a short period of time.Don't give up if you do not see results right away"

We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half-n-half, and you have bliss in a cup.Don't spend your money on the expensive ""designer"" coffees. This is the best!If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"I remember getting christmas blend around 4, 5 and 6 years ago and it had a kind of mild eggnog/nutmeg/spiced flavor that I can't describe very well but I liked.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"First of all, Sombra works. Second, it's easy and convenient which means no muss or fuss working it. It's also very reasonably priced compared to a lot of massage oils and seems to go pretty far for me.What I really like about a roll on pain reliever is that you don't get the gel all over your hands. Honestly, try as you might, you cannot always get every bit of the liniment off your hands--and if you get it in your eyes or nose, it's worse than the original pain you were treating.Another thing about the roll on products is like a back rubber, this roll on bottle will extend your reach to that mid-back area that you cannot always get on your own--especially if you're sore or stiff.Sombra is thick enough to stay where you put it, too. You're not going to have it running down your back to someplace you'd rather it not be--or staining your clothes."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"These are, without a doubt, the best refrieds I've ever prepared and/or eaten ... and I'm a long time lover of refried beans.They are a snap to prepare. Although the directions say to cover and simmer for five minutes, I've found it best to turn the heat to low and stir uncovered for about three minutes or so, then remove the pan from the burner and let them sit covered for a couple more minutes.A quick comparison to a can of top brand 'fat free' refried beans shows that the Santa Fe Fat Free Vegetarian beans have less than half the sodium! And, because of the handy packaging, you can reduce the salt further by shaking the pouch first. This knocks some of the salt to the bottom. Then scoop the contents of the bag into the boiling water, leaving the salty residue at the bottom of the pouch - don't need it.Plus, there are so many additional things you can do with refried beans that are prepared this way. (e.g. add extra water for delicious bean soup or use as a great base for chili). The creative possibilities with this simple ""comfort food"" are endless.Oh, and they are a great value, also!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"After my daughters celiac diagnosis, we had to buy the frozen gluten free breads and the kids were NOT happy. Although, the frozen bread is good to eat right after toasting it, it just did not work well for sandwiches in the kids lunch box. So, I searched the net for bread recipes and became really frustrated because my bread would cave in each time. Then I found Pamela's Amazing Bread. Let me tell you, it is truly amazing in my eyes. Not only does it taste great, but it bakes beautifully in my bread maker. It has a nice crust and is soft and great for sandwiches, grilled cheese, toast, etc. We add 1/4 cup of flaxseed to the mix. Kids love it, so mom is really happy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I bought this for my son's new GFCF diet.

The first time I made it for him, I made this type and our regular quick jarred gravy for the rest of the family, assuming this wouldn't be very good or ""what we were used to"". ALL of us liked this gravy so much better! We were pleasantly surprised. Now, it's never going to be as good as ""real"" fat gravy you can make, but if you think the regular powdered or jar gravy is pretty good, and are opting for healthier options, then the smoky, meaty flavor this gravy gives (WITHOUT the MEAT) really is good. We are now going to eat this in place of our 'regular' gravy. Oh, and this Amazon bulk order is huge - you should be set for life - but a great price!"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"This digital thermometer by Vicks really helps me take my temperature. I am beginning a course of chemotherapy treatment and my doctor tells me that it is imperative that I monitor my temperature at least once a day.The thermometer is remarkably easy to use and a HUGE improvement over those tough to read glass and mercury thermometers of the years when I was a kid. Just press the on/off button (the bluish button) and insert the thermometer into your mouth according to the specific instructions that will come with the thermometer. (If you have any questions or uncertainties about how to use this, ask a pharmacist, a doctor, a nurse or call the manufacturer to make sure that you're using the thermometer correctly.)The thermometer numbers are easy to read and after you take your temperature you can just push the on/off bluish button a second time in order to turn off the thermometer. If you forget to turn it off it will automatically turn itself off after ten minutes. Impressive!Overall, I highly recommend this type of thermometer. It's waterproof; it can measure body temperature through the mouth, the underarm or your bottom; and it does come with a very good warranty.Great job, Vicks!"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This is an excellent massager, with many benefits if used consistently. Initially, I didn't like this massager compared to the original Panasonic Easy Reach massager I had. When that faithful, and great working massager broke last year (after using it for nearly 7 years), I was dismayed to find it had been replaced with this one, which is very different in design from the original. But I bought this one anyway, and decided to give it a try. After trying to use it like the old one a few times, I was very disappointed. It was nothing like it, and much heavier, and harder to move around easily.But then, after setting this massager aside, and trying another new massager for a bit (and being disappointed), I decided to give this Panasonic one more try. I also decided to use the first massage setting at the initial slow speed, and to move, or hold it in one small circular area for one full cycle before moving it to another area. I did this when I was suffering from severe bronchitis, and it helped to encourage my body to cough out the mucus in my lungs every day. As a result, I felt much better after a couple of weeks of daily massaging. In addition, it stimulates my sluggish lymphatic flow under my arms, and in my chest, encouraging drainage. This has helped to alleviate the bad swelling in my upper torso and joints, and greatly decrease the edema in my legs. In addition, one full body massage can put me into a deep state of relaxation so that I can sleep much better. As a result, with regular massages, I am beginning to look, and feel much better as my body gets detoxified, and I get more healing sleep!There is a definite trick to using this massager effectively, however, and this is how I do it"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"A while back, I bought one of those spider-like head massagers with all the little vibrating tips. I love that thing - it just sends waves of tingles all the way down your back when those tips hit the right spots. Endorphin release, is what the salesperson at the mall kiosk told me.The problem is, someone has to move the thing all over your head for this to occur. Or you can do it yourself, but that usually ends with a big cramp in one shoulder and it kind of ruins the good sensation. So when I saw this helmet head massager, I thought that might fit the bill.Overall, it's more comfortable than it looks. The rubber pads are soft, and it doesn't squeeze or pinch. I don't detect anything that could actually qualify as acupressure. It just sits on your head and vibrates. The control allows variable levels of vibration, and the design works pretty well for tension headaches that land at the base of your skull and top of your neck. But not the same tingly sensation as the spider-like massager.The description says you can use it at work or in the car, but even at the lower settings it caused enough vibration to distort my vision so I'm not sure I'd recommend much more than attempting to walk across the living room. In fact, using it while watching TV might GIVE you an eyestrain headache. Aside from that, it's OK."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I agree with other reviewers that it would be MUCH better if these bottles were bigger. If I'm puming after a feeding or something they're fine, but if I'm pumping in place of a feeding, I generally pump about 6 oz which is just enough that the bottles won't hold it all, but also enough that if I try to switch bottles I wind up with two bottles that only have a quarter z or so each in them. It's annoying. And maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem like you can buy the larger collection bottles separately - you either have to get them with a kit, or with a feeding and storage set, either way you're paying for additional parts you don't need. The plusses though are these things come pre-sterilized and the small size has some advantages - topping off a newborn who only needs an ounce or two, or pre-measuring a couple of ounces of breastmilk to mix with cereal, for example."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"Splenda is a very good sweetener for beverages like coffee or iced tea. It has no calories and no carbohydrates either. It uses sucralose as a sugar substitute.I usually prefer Sweet And Low for my sweetener; but when I can't get my hands on that Splenda is a fairly good substitute. Splenda is my second choice (along with Equal) because it's not quite as sweet as Sweet And Low. On the other hand, if you prefer a non-sugar sweetener that's not too sweet or potent, then Splenda would be a good choice for you.Splenda is a powdery white substance. Just open the individual packet or packets and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. They say you may prefer to use the granular form of Splenda for recipes but if you don't have that handy these packets will do. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.Overall, Splenda is a good choice for a sweetener substitute for sugar. It isn't quite as potent as Sweet And Low; that can be a good or bad thing depending on how sweet you like your beverages or recipes. I myself prefer the taste of Sweet And Low. Of course, you can always add a little more Splenda to make the drink or recipe a bit sweeter.Four stars."

I can't believe other reviewers rate the product so high??? Luckily, I found a much better product called ProFresh.

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,"The Apex Pocket Med Pack with 7 Day Tray solved the dilemma I was facing regarding my wonderful mother pill taking regime. Mama is complicated in just about anything she does and had accumulated many different pill dispensers, but for some reason or the other she would still carry one or two loose pills to her room for later consumption. The dispensers she had where okey, in principle, but the Apex solved the dilemma of her having to transport pills here and there around the house. Now she takes the corresponding day container and makes sure AM are finished by 1 PM and PM before night-night. Plus the added convenience to be able to take them as needed to restaurants, theaters, etc and even to week long stays at Hotels (Mama is a Big Hotel goer, Big Buffet eater and Chocolate Guzzler, but that I am sure is another story and not up for further review) so now she can easily keep up with her well established regime, wether stationary or on the road, with the help of the Apex Pocket Med Pack with 7 Day Tray. My only complaint and minor at that, is that the actual tray is very flimsy and does not really secure the containers all that well, but since she is not planning on using it like Maracas I guess they will have to do. 4 Stars and May 2008 bring all the Happiness that the People of this Great Country Surely Deserve!"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This bottle does have a lot of parts to clean but if you weigh the options of spending about an extra 10 minutes per day cleaning bottle and your baby having less gas, it is worth it. This bottle has 5 parts to clean and others usually have about 3. So if you clean 8 bottles per day and the Dr. Brown's bottles have 2 extra parts, that is like cleaning 16 extra parts per day. Really, it takes maybe 10 seconds per extra part. So, what is an extra 2-3 minutes. Nothing!! Everyone says, yes they are great bottles but there are so many parts to clean. Really, think about it. It doesn't take that much longer to clean! I will stand by these bottles all the way...less gas, less smacking when he eats and a happier baby in the end. And, I have tried every bottle including, Avent, Playtex vent air, MAM and others. Also, get the 8 oz bottles right away. If you spend the money on the smaller bottles because you baby only eats 4 oz now, he/she will be eating more in a few weeks/months and then you will have to buy more bottles. 3oz fits into an 8 oz bottle so why not just get the larger bottles right away."

I've taken them on road trips, shared them at the office, and even gave them as stocking-stuffers this year. I find them delightfully sweet and crunchy, which is perfect for my typical snack craving. The powder at the bottom of the bag doesn't bother me, but I can understand the frustration some folks have voiced; if you get it on your hands with any moisture at all, it can stick.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I am lucky to be a stay-at-home mom, and only pump occasionally, but when I do these bags are great! After reading reviews on this and several other bags, each one seemed to have good and bad reviews, but I have nothing bad to say about these Lansinoh bags. My son is 5 months old now, and I pump 1-2 times a week at the most for a small outing/emergency supply. These bags are pretty easy to fill (just be careful pouring) and seal. I cinch the bag between two of my fingers right at the milk line, then ""zipper"" the bag all the way to the lock line with my fingers to get rid of any air bubbles. The double-zipper lock is also a definite plus. I lay them flat to freeze in my standard door freezer, then store them long-term in my deep freeze after they are solid. Fortunately I have never had any problems with leaking. I have recently increased the amount that I pump, so I'm planning on buying another box! If you try them, I hope they work well for you too."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"UPDATE:So after using this cup for 3 weeks now, I have to admit that it leaks SOMETIMES! When first reassembled after washing, the cup does not leak ... even when vigorously shaken upside down! Once my daughter drinks out of it .... one of three scenarios has happened:1) the cup still does not leak when vigorously shaken upside downOR2) the cup leaks a few drops before stopping even when shaken (I think this is liquid that is left in the spout after already passing through the valve)OR3) the cup leaks when shaken.I have not quite figured out yet why it leaks sometimes and not other times. Anyway, my daughter still loves this sippy and I will keep using it since she is usually in the highchair when drinking.As for assembling the cup ... it has become much easier, and it works best if I pull (and wiggle) the spout through the lid instead of pushing the spout through the lid from the inside.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't think this cup is as bad as other reviewers rated it. Yes, it does have some design issues (and maybe Thermos is ""listening""), e.g it is really difficult to reassemble and you need to align the spout (purple) exactly into the lid (pink) or the sippy does not close right (I assume that's why other say it leaks). But if assembled correctly this sippy does not leak. Another plus is that it is made of durable stainless steel, therefore BPA-free and healthier than other plastic sippies. If this means that I have to put a little bit more effort into reassembling it, so be it. The only issue I have with this sippy is that i don't see how much my daughter is drinking, but that is expected of a stainless steel cup.I also own the BornFree Training Cup (not the BornFree Drinking Cup!), but my 6 month old daughter prefers the Foogo. Personally I don't really like the spout of the BornFree Training Cup because there is not much difference between the spout and a bottle nipple ... they both have a y-cut (so what's the point of transitioning to a cup?) and the valve is not directly attached to the inside of the spout (guess that's why they need the leak-proof y-cut ... also why their Drinking Cup leaks)."

It has always remained cool inside, regardless of the outside temperature, for at least 48 hours (usually longer) before I have to recharge it. It is now four years old and, while it takes a bit longer than ten minutes for the initial charge, still working as well as before."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading brings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is very good. I bought a bunch of rainbow salt flavors based on the previous review of this product. I like this the best of the ones I bought, which I thought i would. I used to use morton's lime salt, but i can't find it very often and this is much better, more of an actual lime flavor than just citric acid. Very good!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,My wife & I have been using this often and on over the last few years. It doesn't smell but doesn't work as fast and as well as Blue Stuff which is REALLY smelly and more expensive. We strongly suggest it although you have to be patient and might need to add a generous amount.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Everyone told me to get an electric pump so I did. I got an Ameda. I've been through 2 Ameda pumps in 6 months. When it broke the second time (suction stopped working), I went out and got this one as a backup. I've heard great things about this one, not only from two friends, but online. Well, I am sorry I did not get this sooner and saved myself a ton of money!! This pump is great!It works just as good as the electric poump, in less time and comfortably!! It is very compact and easy to transport. And most importantly, it works like a charm!! I am able to pump each side in about 5 min. Now I understand why my friend who has this pump says she only pumps 5 min on each side...I couldn't understand why she didn't pump longer...with this pump, you don't need to pump longer. With the electric, I pump 15 min on both sides at the same time!! What a waste of time!! And no wonder I'm sore with a machine tugging at me for 15 min!!The comfort shield on this pump is great; pumping is comfortble, there is no tugging on the breast and it's big enough where the nipple does not rub against the flange.I can't express how much I am impressed with this pump. I think I will be pushing aside my electric pump (once I get it replaced) for this one."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"I've almost finished one can, and while it is quite tasty, it tastes only remotely like coffee, if even that much. It is a bit sweet, which detracts from its taste for me as I did not add sweetener to my coffe when I drank it. All in all, though teeccino is quite tasty, I'm still looking for a real coffee substitute with a real coffee taste as I am convinced that the negatives of coffee outweigh the positives."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,Excellent non-greasy pain reliever. I have chronic neck and shoulder pain from sitting at a computer all day. Flexall is all I have found that gives adequate relief without using pain medications.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I've just started eating these in the last 3 days. I've tried several of bars and found most of them too awful to finish. This includes some of the other Luna Bars (s'mores, lemon) and a couple of the CLIF bars as well. What I like about Nutz Over Chocolate is the fact that the taste is relatively mild and pleasing, and the texture is easy to handle and eat (not too crumbly, not to gross-looking, not unpleasant once they are in your mouth).Aside from the fact that they are ""made for women"", and I'm a guy...I really can't find anything negative to say about them. Best part? I get a good 2-3 hours of feeling full on a consumption of only 170 calories. I guess we'll see, but I have a feeling that I'll really grow to love them over time. That's my beef with a lot of these diet products...they don't have to ""taste great"", but if you can make them nice and mild like this particular flavor, they go down easy and get the job done. In this case, since the taste is somewhat pleasing as well, that's a bonus. I'll be recommending them to my friends."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"At first I thought the rain sound was great to sleep to, until I figured out the pattern, then it became a little annoying with the predictable drip drops. The ocean sound has seagulls in it--not exactly relaxing. The heartbeat is a little eerie. The only sound that I found not to be conducive to insomnia is the waterfall. It just sounds like radio static. The little green power on light can be pretty bright at night too. The other night the power went out and when it came back on, the sound setting changed to rainforest birds!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHH.Overall I don't think it's the best money can buy, but for $17.00 at bed bath and beyond(with store coupon) it's worth a try."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"At firsti wasn't quite sure of the quality by just looking at the product photo,and the product discription does not do it justice. I was pleasantly surprised after i opened it up. You can not imagine how sturdy and solid this table is put together,and for the price you cannot afford to pass it up. i am 6'-0"" and 210 lbs, this table is plenty wide.while it may be a little heavy for women to tote around, but for me it's easy to fold and carry and easily stores in a closet. for prospective buyers, i don,t think you would be disapointed."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"We have uses these bottles for 2 months. About 1 out of 3 bottles leak. And we're not talking a drop or two. We're talking about milk flowing out of the cap as if it's not even secured. You can insert the nipple into the screw cap, hear the ""click"", squeeze it tight, squeeze it loose, squeeze it any degree between, but they leak. AVENT's website even has a section on how to prevent the bottles from leaking. You want to know why? Because they leak. AVENT bottles must be the poorest designed product we have used in the past year. They leak, and they leak. They leak at the worst times, they leak and the best. If you want to ensure that your feeding experience with your child will be ruined 33 percent of the time, by all means -waste your money on this poor excuse for a product. AVENT should be ashamed of themselves."

I have had regular periods and have been ovulating since I stopped taking birth control. I saw the advertisement with the hopes of conceiving quickly and I thought, every little bit helps. Since taking this product for 5 weeks, I have NOT ovulated. I have stopped taking it and hoping for the best next month."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"Smart Pop tastes good but it's not good for you. It contains palm oil which is one of the cheapest vegetable oils on the market. The World Health Organization states there is convincing evidence that palm oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. The fine print on the Smart Pop package says that the palm oil adds an amount of trans fat to each serving. They do not specify the actual amount other than to say that it's a ""trivial"" amount. No thanks!The FDA says ""Choose vegetable oils (except coconut and palm kernel oils) and soft margarines (liquid, tub, or spray) more often because the combined amount of saturated and trans fats is lower than the amount in solid shortenings, hard margarines, and animal fats, including butter."""
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,1.0,"These banana chips definitely have a nice flavor to them but have far too many calories and are loaded with saturated fat. The bags are small (could easily be eaten in one sitting) and contain a whopping 600 calories and 30 grams of artery-clogging saturated fat. For comparison sake, a McDonald's Big Mac has the same amount of saturated fat as one serving of banana chips (each bag contains three servings). I'm definitely disappointed I purchased this product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"These crackers are delicious for snacking, topping, dipping, etc. They are light and crispy with a buttery taste. The flax seeds and whole wheat give them an edge taste-wise over other snack crackers, but they are only ever so slightly more wholesome. I served them with cheese balls during the holidays, and everyone who tried them liked them. I didn't find that I had much breakage in each package, but I also got a case with an expiration code three months out."

It's reasonably priced, too."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"We love the taste & texture of these seeds. I put several tablespoons in our salads & my husband has started scraping out his salad bowl with a spoon!

health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,4.0,"I just got these a few weeks ago and have been able to wear them with zero problems as far as my body reacting poorly to them. The only drawback is that they're hard to put on unless you have very strong thumbs, so plan to keep them on for a while once you get them fastened."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Muscle Milk's taste is far better than any other protein shake I've tried. The blueberry flavor is very tolerable, and it mixes readily with water. The chocolate tastes extremely chocolaty (which may or may not be a good thing for you), but it's tougher to mix. The chocolate appears to be a finer powder, and it clumps up more easily than the blueberry did.I will definitely purchase again, but I will probably go back to the blueberry flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"These are one of my favorite flavors of Luna bars. What I love about Luna bars is that they are packed with vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplementation and they taste great. They are also made with organic ingredients, and they are made especially for the nutritional needs of women. The S'mores flavor has a great, rich chocolate topping/coating and it seems that sometimes they have a hint of coconut flavor(that could be my imagination), which reminds me of a macaroon cookie or an Almond Joy bar. They don't taste much like an actual s'more like you'd have around the campfire, though.The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is that the bars are quite high in carbohydrates and don't have as much protein as I'd like. However, if you are looking for a snack or something to control those cravings, these are a far superior option to candy or cookies, they're nutritious, have less than 200 calories/bar, satisfy, and they do taste good."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"How nice to have milk on hand that won't be spoiled when you need it. I use milk for my instant breakfast drink, but often don't have milk in the fridge. This product dissolves well even in ice water, and tastes like fresh dairy. I use it in cooking, too--very yummy!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I was excited to use this product especially after reading the wonderful reviews. I am sorry that I have to write a bad review, but I just couldn't handle it for some reason. I started the cleanse this morning and had a terrible time gagging down the fiber. Each time I swallowed some, it came back up. So I bought some fiber from the store (breaking the rules, but it was worth it to not have to experience the fiber concoction again.) That made it so much easier. This afternoon, around lunch time, I started to get a headache. I assumed it was from the fast and decided to stick it out until my body got used to it. Then my stomach started progressively getting more and more uneasy and my headache so much worse. A couple hours after my dinner set of pills, I threw it all up. (It tastes even worse coming UP!) I was disappointed because I really wanted this to work for me. Immediately after I threw up, my stomach felt better and my headache started going away and now I feel TONS better. It just didn't agree with me. I wish it did."

They were ordered/paid for a Christmas present in around October and still had not come before Christmas and when called they still took there time sending them and didn't even apologize. I think in all it took 3 months to get.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"These are great-tasting snacks. They taste a lot like the peanut-flavored Clark Bars that have been around for a long time. We have been buying them for years; however, Wal-Mart, Target and Kroeger's have all stopped carrying them, so I was happy to find them on Amazon."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,There's no other on the market as good as this. I've ordered it many times. My family wouldn't settle for anything less. Simply the Best.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"This sauce is so good! It's like Worsterchire sauce but with the consistency of ketchup.. It's really delicious..You're supposed to use this on your Okonomiyaki and takoyaki, but you could use it for anything, even steak! It's really delicious, and I would recommend just keeping a couple bottles around, because once you taste this, you'll want to have it with you always, it's that good."

I plugged it in days ago and I am still waiting for it to warm up. Only one small area in the very center of the pad gets minimally warm. I am extremely unhappy with this product and will be returning it for a refund!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,These are really good. The flavor and texture reminds me of a Snickers Bar. I will definitely be ordering more of these.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"I've gotten the Land O Lakes mint hot chocolate in the variety packs before and this is my favorite flavor, so I thought why not just drink the one I like best. Actually, I mentioned it to my best friend and she ordered me a case last year for Christmas and I LOVED it!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola bars,5.0,This makes a perfect breakfast food. The protein really holds you over. I eat one every morning and then go work out for an hour and I'm still not hungry again til about 1:00.The flavor of this particular bar is very good as well. The dark chocolate chips and tart cherries are a good mix and it's just sweet enough without being too sweet. This is my favorite Kashi product!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I was going along fine with pregnancy until they gave me the prescription prenatal which had parabens and dyes in it. Don't know why they add that stuff when it's not necessary. I started getting sick and decided to order these. I took them all through the first and most of the second before they decided to try a prenatal that had the ""stool softener"" in it. I wasn't having problems but figured soon I would. This prenatal actually made constipation worse so I again, switched back to Rainbow Light and all was better. All of our ultrasounds show a very healthy, very very active baby - why rock the boat? I am in my 3rd trimester and doing great. Only negative is that this vitamin may not have as much iron as the prescriptions - I just started an iron supplement of 325mg."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"I am truly surprised to see all the 5 star reviews here for these Zoe's Chocolate Delight bars. They just don't taste good at all to me. There is something ""off"" about the taste. The chocolate doesn't really taste much like chocolate at all -- I'm not sure how to describe it. In addition, there is an aftertaste that other people have mentioned they noticed in Zoe bars. Even taking into account that they are designed to be lower in refined sugar and higher in fiber, they are still quite bland and could use more sweetness. In no way do they taste even close to a candy bar like other protein bars can. I am a major connoisseur of the lower-sugar, lower-calorie, higher-fiber protein bars, and I have to say that Zoe's bars rank last in my opinion. I have had many other bars with the same approximate amount of sugar and number of calories that were all sweeter, more filling, more satisfying, and simply taste way better all around. Three of my favorites that I would recommend"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I'm prone to ulcers and other GI problems, so I'm under doctor's orders to take this daily (not just for the 14 day dosage).

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Like any fully conscious person with a conscience, I have concerns about my health, my body, and the health of the environment. So, the thought of responsibly grown 100% cotton, bleached with a method free of dioxin as a byproduct, was definitely appealing. I swallowed the extra expense, thinking these just had to be better. Well, sadly, I found the absorbency a bit lacking, and I do NOT have a heavy flow. It was irritating that the tampons would begin leaking, forcing me to change them only to find they weren't completely saturated. All of the frequent changes irritated me setting off a chain of yeast infections. You might not like reading this review, if you were interested in purchasing Natracare; but I must tell you all hope is NOT lost! There really is a better way! If you really care about your health, and the health of the environment, try a Diva cup. It's truly everything that these tampons were not, and them some. You might think you have to make some sort of sacrifice to help the environment, but I will tell you reusable menstrual cups are not only more responsible, but also more convenient for you. Why pay someone in a foreign country to break their back raising organic cotton so you can pay a fortune for the priveledge of bleeding all over it and then send it to the landfill where it will take who knows how long to break down? In posting this review I'm only trying to help someone who shares my concerns about tampon safety, and who might not otherwise hear about menstrual cups for several more years, if ever in their lives. The only way I found out about them, you see, is because another tampon reviewer mentioned it in her review, and I'm thankful she did. It has changed my life for the better. BTW, Amazon also sells Diva cups. Read the reviews."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This is a great product. It's big enough to cover my whole back and stays warm for a long time. The moist heat feels wonderful. My Mother and I both purchased one and we are so happy with it, we highly recommend it."

Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients"

baby products,feeding,pillows stools,4.0,This is a unique gift for every mother-to-be. And all the varieties in the different prints make it even easier to find the fitting one for the person you want to surprise with this cozy pillows. My friend didn't want to know the sex of her baby so things to get her for her shower were getting difficult to find since everything is pretty much pink or blue...so these different prints made it easy for me to chose one pillow set for her. A perfect memorable and useful (!) gift!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"I bought these bottles because they are an inexpensive BPA free option. However, I am very disappointed. There are 5 parts (6 if you include the lid) to this bottle. If not put together just right, they leak! The bottom of this bottle screws on. It has 2 parts. The liner must be put in the bottle just right and then screwed on tight. The nipple must be pulled all the way through (you'd think that'd be easy to tell, huh). If either of these areas aren't put together right, WATCH OUT! Oh, and be careful trying to tighten one end while holding the other. Nothing like a lap full of liquid!One other thing, this bottle takes longer to warm than other bottles whose bottoms aren't as bulky.I would not buy this bottle again. There are other alternatives that are much easier (and BPA free) for a busy Mom to use."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"When my baby was born, I had a hard time nursing. I was tired from labor, drowsy from meds--and dreaded the late-night feedings. I was also a slow learner with breastfeeding positions. The ""My Brest Friend"" pillow was literally my lifesaver. When I strapped it around my waist, I could easily roll my baby in toward me, cradle her in my arms, and keep my hands relatively free to readjust her when she got unlatched. For me as a 1st-time mom who wanted to breastfeed, the ""My Brest Friend"" pillow was invaluable."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,4.0,The popcorn itself is very good but the seller lacks the brains to pack it correctly so when the popcorn came the bag was split and popcorn was spilled all inside the box and leaking out of 1 corner.
health personal care,health care,stimulants,5.0,"These little chews pack a heck of a punch. They have the consistency a little softer that a tootsie role a nice chocolate flavor with a slight bitter aftertaste, from the 100mg of caffeine no doubt, as caffeine is very bitter. I think this company has really hit the mark on this type of product. There is simply nothing out there that can deliver this kind of boost in such a small convenient package. As an avid motorcyclist and pilot I would recommend these to all my associates as a great alternative to having a drink spill in your lap at 10,000 feet or having to use the restroom 10 minutes after a cup of coffee or a sport drink. These chews will be a big deal."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I found this happy wrap to be indespensible during the cold winter in a drafty home. Many uses. Once heated for 21/2 minutes in the microwave, I keep warm by sitting on it, throwing it on my lap, warming my feet, my arthritic knees and back and of couse my neck. The warm, moist heat is soothing. Slight smell but not enough to prevent me from using it several times a day to keep warm. Don't intend to use it in the summer."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Very sturdy and attractive design. Heat option works fine and takes about 10 minutes to warm up. Extra cushioning in mattress makes the table very comfortable. The 30 inch salon size is the way to go. The only suggestion is to include more detailed instructions for the initial setup. It took a while to figure out where everything went. Once completed, the table is easy to setup and take down. We couldn't be happier with this purchase."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I am so happy I found this product! It just works!I was horrified when I found not one but two plantars warts on my 7-year-old's feet. I'd had such warts myself in the past, and removing them was a painful and not always successful experience. I saw this Wart Stick, was impressed by the 40% as opposed to usual 15% active ingredient, and thought that the wax base might keep the medicine in contact with the wart longer (an issue with an active kid!). Over the course of a few weeks I rubbed the stick onto my daughter's warts, and occasionally used an emery board to take down the surrounding callous and dead wart off the top (which was a painless experience for my very sensitive girl, hurray). The first wart fell off her foot last week, and the second is about to break off. They just dry up, darken, and fall off! What a relief! I'm always having some of this on hand. No pain, no smell, no mess, and the warts just go away. What more could you ask? I'm a very happy customer.Kathy in S.B."

health personal care,health care,first aid,2.0,"I don't think this did anything actually. I still have a scar. But, this is my review from before....The product was recommended to me by my plastic surgeon. I had a scar on my face that I am trying to revise. So, needless to say I am being very careful. I am applying as it has said (twice per day). The scar is healing nicely so far (about 1 month), but it is difficult to say whether it would have been worse without it. The surgery was 6 weeks ago, so it is still a young scar. The ridges that formed quickly are just now going down and the redness is lessening each day.In contrast I have been using it on a scar I have had for 10+ years and the difference is slim to none, but I will keep using it there. Fortunately one tube goes a very long way."

If my order is any indication, they are - fast delivery, good condition, the usual good taste."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"In my opinion these are better tasting than your average ""100 calorie pack"" and ten less cals.

And when I saw this on amazon, with garlic in it (my favourite cooking ingredient), I thought I'd give it a try. What a lucky find! This is amazing! I use it on everything from egg rolls to prawns to chips. And despite the fact that garlic is my favourite cooking ingredient, I've often come across dishes or condiments where the taste of garlic is too over powering (you can have to much of a good thing). But they've gotten the balance just right here. I'll be ordering up several more for family and friends when I'm next in the US!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Taylor's of Harrowgate put out a very very fine bulk loose tea product that is the biggest bang for your buck. Why pay $6 or more in the store for 3.5 ounces of loose tea, or worse yet, $3 or more for 1.25 ounces of tea in tea bags, when you can get 24 or even 35 ounces (depending on what variety) for $25 to $40?This product comes air tight sealed in a mylar plastic bag with a silver liner to keep out the light, and stores very nicely in your cabinet after opening in a one gallon zip lock style bag in a DARK PLACE away from the light. i have also heard of people storing in it your freezer too, but from what I understand that's not recommended.A nice medium strength tea that takes sugar or honey well, not too ""orangery"".I make two pots of tea a day, and to avoid all the hassle and mess I use a 4 cup ""French Press"" Coffee Maker (available for about $25). I pour the tea leaves out into the sink when I am done into a 2 cup fine mesh strainer with handles, and let drain for 10 minutes, and then knowck it upside down in the trash bin. No mess, ne funky tea leaves in your cup, no messing around with those dumb egg shaped tea infusers that always seem to come apart anyway and flood your cup with tea leaves.I recommend this brand of tea to every one, and plan to try all the varieties of it!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"I just started using this for my 9 month old only b/c she started not wanting to sit in the original high chair we have (Fisher Price Space Saver). We had purchased this as a travel high chair to take with us to dinner at other people's homes. For that purpose it definitely is very useful - easy to collapse, carry and install.However, for every day use, I think it is just OK. I find that it sits too low, even on the highest setting. The tray is lower than our table level (vs. the Space Saver where it was about the same level). This is particularly frustrating for me b/c we have a dog who is now able to put his chin on the high chair tray.The dishwasher safe tray (white one) does not seem to snap on well so my baby keeps playing with it and is able to totally pull it off. As a result, I just stopped using it and directly use the blue tray. I personally find that it is a bit hard to snap the tray on and off.I don't think this would be easy to use for a baby first learning to sit in the high chair unless your baby already sits unsupported pretty well. The seat back is very upright and does not recline. It is also a hard seat with no padding."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"Okay, I didn't read the description very well. I ordered ""loose"" tea on accident. By ""loose"" tea, I just thought it still meant it would be in a tea bag. I know, don't make fun of me. I just didn't read it well, and I am not an expert on tea. Being frugal like I am, I was forced to use the tea anyway. (I would still like directions on how to make it without a fancy strainer. It just went straight through my colander. hee hee) I put the recommended amount in the coffee maker and brewed it that way. It was way too strong. I was able to get three gallons of iced tea from the recommended amount for one. Anyway, after a lot of trial and error, I now have drinkable tea. Lipton has always been my favorite tea, and after I drink all of this that I purchased, I will probably stick with the loose tea. Frugality wins always..."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"This is my severalth soundmachine I have purchased over that last 10 years from HoMedics. This is the basic model, adjustable volume, no clock etc. But you can turn it up pretty loud to drown out other noises & have a good nights sleep. Good for sleeping babies too. I have never used the timer feature, we keep ours on all night. I also like the fact that its a basic model so it travels well if you travel & cannot sleep w/out it. If you really listen you can hear the loop of the sound but it doesnt bother me, I mean I dont listen in anticiaption for it. It is better than the white noise from a fan because you can turn up the volume & travels w/ you, and wont dry your eyes out like a fan & not too breezy in the winter. I paid extra shipping last time to get mine here quicker because I found it very hard to sleep w/ out it when my last one finally quit."

health personal care,health care,unknown,3.0,When I opened the box I found that the packing material which was styrofoam sheets had broken into little tiny balls that literaly covered the product which was covered in a greasy coating. So it took forever to clean the item. Once I was able to get it together I found the following. The tilt function is wonderful but the small lip allows everything to roll off the edge and in my opinion although there are a few tilt settings only the first one is unusable anymore tilt than that and the slightest pressure would push the tray away from you. Also there is a bit of slop in the tilt locking so you have a tiny bit of wobble once locked in place. One of the pluses is the height which with the super high mattresses these days is a requirement. It would have been nice to have a split top so one part would hold a beverage and other items you didn't want to have to relocate when you wanted to tilt the table. And finally it can be a bit difficult to raise if your sitting in bed.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I debated for a long time over whether to go with the standard plastic high chair, or splurge for a Svan. Several things tipped me to the side of the Svan.The main thing I like about this chair is that I don't have to throw it away after a year or so. My son can take this chair to college if he wants, as it adjusts in size and I think it can hold up to 175 pounds. I love this adjustability...in fact, we've already lowered the foot rest by an inch to make him more comfortable.I also like the fact that it is quality wood furniture, and that it slides up to the table. I can imagine how nice it will be once my son is older to be able to let him work on art projects and homework at the table in his own chair that is sized for him, and we won't have to get him a booster seat or sit him on phone books!The phthalate-free plastic tray cover is great, as it allows me to give him messy finger food (he's 11 months old now) and it's easy to clean. I also purchased the cushions which I wash every 2-3 weeks.I purchased this chair when my son was 6 months old, and I found that it is not only a great place for him to eat, but it's also a great place for him to sit safely while I'm doing housework or making dinner. He can sit and play with his toys and still be able to see me and feel like he's part of the family.Unlike the first reviewer, I don't have any trouble getting my squirmy little guy into the chair. I always put him in from the back, and even when he's hungry it doesn't take long to get him strapped in.Update"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I'm quite convinced now that late pregnancy and early post-partum are probably the worst periods of time to try to figure out gadgets that don't have clear instructions. In my case, although there was a warning that a basket should always be used in the warmer, my brain erased that comment with the subsequent paragraph that said wide mouth bottles don't require the lift out basket. To be clearer, in both places it should say that the large basket is always required (otherwise you are heating the bottle directly on the plate and also in boiling water... both of which are no-nos.The instructions are also too simplistic. The type of bottle one uses (shape, size, material) will very dramatically affect how the heat from the steam impacts the solution being heated. I would also imagine that some further tweaking will be required as the composition of breastmilk changes during the day and over the course of the post partum period.For example, I used 9 oz MAM Ultivent (BPA free) translucent bottles that are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. In my successful experiment with water chilled in the fridge to about 40 F, I needed to add 2x the max level in the provided measuring tube to get the water up to about 80 F. The unit was on for about 6 minutes until the water all vaporized. This is more than 2x the amount generally recommended in the instruction sheet and the sticker plastered to the side of the unit has even less detail.Note that if you make the mistake of running the unit without any basket, some overheat sensor will trip before the water is completely used up after about a minute or so.Given that there is unlikely any product out there which monitors the temp of the solution being heated (or is otherwise aware of what kind of bottle/solution combo is in place), trial and error and patience will be required with any such product. Life will probably be easier for formula babies since formula doesn't change over time!Good luck!p.s. a water softener with regular applications of rust-inhibitor solution, or the use of distilled water will probably reduce the amount of cleaning required. Using vinegar to remove mineral deposits is the age old standard for cleaning everything from pots and pans to humidifiers etc."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am not much of a pill-swallower, so I hadn't tried melatonin before now. This product is delicious (I chew it rather than sucking it, even though it is called a lozenge) and it makes me sleepy within fifteen minutes. Even if I wake up at 5:30 AM (as I did this morning), I nibble a quarter of it, fall back to sleep and then get up without grogginess at 7:00. I am a very light sleeper and used to stay up all night once awoken, so this is literally a lifesaver for me. (I didn't want to become an Ambien addict). Once when I was severely short of sleep, I fell down the basement stairs and almost killed myself. So sleeplessness is nothing to fool around with. Note"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold. When making it by the glass I take a tall iced tea glass, fill it with very cold spring water and add 2 Raspberry Zinger tea bags. In a couple of minutes I have iced raspberry tea! I drink it unsweetened sometimes but other times I add a little bit of liquid stevia (a natural sweetener found in health food stores that does not have any calories & does not affect your blood sugar) and it is delicious. I sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice. Sometimes I add 6-8 tea bags to a gallon of spring water and make the tea in the fridge. I love to bring a gallon of it to the homes of friends and family when we visit. My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too. Everyone has their own tastes, but everyone that I give it to iced thinks it tastes really good.I have even used it to dye some doll's clothes for an antiqie doll some years ago. Teas can be used as a natural dye source."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is now the only true sports drink. I realized how much of a crock Vitamin Water was shortly after that craze started. I feel like it is an injustice to O Water to compare it to Vitamin Water. O Water was created by one of the Tom's (one of the ""Juice Guys"" that co-founded Nantucket Nectars) and is quickly catching on in cities such as Boston (flagship) and San Francisco. The product is 100% natural and does not have an absolute surplus of vitamins and minerals that just pass through your body because they are supplied in such great abundance. Heres a quick and typical comparison between O Water and Vitamin Water:Sugars = 9g (cane sugar) compared to 13g (sucrose)Cal = 35 compared to 50There is also no artificial colors, preservatives or anything!Where Vitamin Water uses artificial preservatives, O Water only uses natural preservatives such as rosemary oil extract. Simply put, O Water is truly a healthy sports drink that you can enjoy with no shame. For those of you that are on a stricter diet, There is a regular version of O Water, that is simply flavored water with 0 cal. Try some!!!!! Coconut and Blueberry are my favorite Infused O Waters."

They're shipped from Canada and I think a lot of people don't realize that they, along with Europe, write their dates opposite to us. Like March 5 would be 050308, not like we would expect 030508.

We both expected it to be barely noticeable in a few months. Mederma just didn't help to prevent hypertrophic scarring. I will use silicone sheets next time."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"...is my good friend knows a guy who owns a health food store and this is the stuff he takes. I was convinced, and then I tried it and it's amazing. I've been taking it for a while now and with my (average American) diet, I gotta get some natural energy supplement. I laugh at what our ""Monster Bull"" society spends on their silly and worthless energy drinks. It makes so much sense when you realize how worthless tablets are. Convenient ""squeeze-a-shot"" technology makes it easy to take a shot after breakfast and chase it with water or juice to equally distribute throughout your body or mix it! Tastes fine.I honestly want to say Thank you to Liquid Health for this product!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"They taste great. I'll give them that. Oh, what's that you say, your kids think they're candy bars? Well, that's because they are--look at the ingredients. The first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup! As far as taste is concerned, these bars are tops, but the protein count is low compared to everything else on the market and the empty calories are through the roof. Let's face it, it's a candy bar with a few vitamins stuffed in."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This Numi black tea is a very nice Earl Grey. When I am in the mood for the delicate flavor of orange bergamot, this is the Earl Grey I reach for.Numi truly excels at blending exquisite tea and I don't mind paying more for their superior product."

I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I don't think I can add a lot more information about the Avent Isis IQ Duo, than other already have mentioned in their reviews. However, I am one of the fortunate ones who first got to try out a Medela Pump in Style Original, but then bought the Avent... so here's my 2-cents worth:I LOVE the Avent breastpump and would NEVER go back to medela. Medela is not a bad product, but Avent just does a better job for me.I really like the cushions used for the Avent pump. It makes pumping feel so much more comfortable and 'softer'. I also like that I can choose my own speed, and therefore I am able to mimic my baby's sucking. I am able to express more breastmilk with the Avent, which will hopefully help to keep my milk supply up while I'm back at work.One downside is, as mentioned by another review, that assembly and disassembly of the Avent takes a little longer. The tubes are stiffer than the ones on the medela pump, which means that I have to detach the tubes before I can pack everything in the bag. The same counts for the power cord. So, at work, where I can't just leave the pump sitting there, I have to take it apart and put it back to gether after/before every use.However, what really counts for me is the endresult"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I have toes that bend in crazy directions. It was almost impossible to wear shoes for an entire day without crippling pain - even ugly orthopedic shoes! I was even considering toe surgery. I was very sceptical of the Toe-stretchers. I figured I was throwing good money away, but that it would be a cheaper, less invasive step before a surgical consultation. Wow! Overnight relief! Now I almost never have pain. I can't say enough good things about this product."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,3.0,"I machine washed one of these on delicate and it fell apart. When I contacted the company, it said they were not meant to be washed, only surface cleaned. I did have success when I had to do more than surface clean by soaking in a sink and air dry.Be prepared to mend with superglue. The seams/zippers are bonded with heat, so they are not that secure. Small holes/tears occur, but can be repaired with superglue. Other than that, they are a bargain."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is by far our favorite brand of Earl Grey tea. The flavor is nice and not too strong. It is good as a hot tea and also makes a refreshing glass of ice tea. As with other reviewers, I was happy that Amazon started carrying it and at a price much better than the grocery store."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,4.0,"Mucinex is time released guaifenesin. Very pricy, but a great product. It thins the mucus in your body and works wonders with congestion and the ""gunk"" that forms in your sinuses. In years past you could buy generic time released quaifenesin at your pharamacy. The FDA pulled those products from the market. However, I took the generic versions for years and they also worked great. With the others out of the way Mucinex makers can charge what they want. Amazon.com's price for the 500 count bottle is good. I've done a lot of price shopping. I take two tabs twice a day, everyday. It greatly reduces the number of sinus infections I have."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"The wrap is partially-filled and the baffling is poor, meaning that you can shake down the seeds to one side and have empty fabric for OVER HALF of the length of the wrap. Since the seeds carry the heat/cold, I end up having to constantly readjust and fold it over. I am sewing the ends and the neckline to try and keep the seeds together. If I had been able to see it first, I would not have purchased it."

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,2.0,"I thought I was going to LOVE this product! I was using it to double-check my Clear Blue Fertility monitor and figured this would equal conception success.First cycle worked like a charm. It seemed to correspond to both the CBFM and regular OPK sticks. I got an ""Not Reading"" error, though, several times but it was easily remedied by soaking the sensor for a minute or so, per the instructions. Kinda annoying and made me want to constantly run ""test mode"" to check to see if it works.Second cycle was a bust!!! I tried to get it started early in the day on cycle day 2. I was shocked to see a low battery indicator flashing. It had only been used for one 35-day cycle and the battery claimed to have a 6-month life. Oh well. Swapped out the battery and the low-battery icon still flashed. I put the watch ""to sleep"" and woke it up again. No low battery icon. But... no matter what I did for the next two days, the watch kept saying ""Not Reading."" I tried every tip in the manual and their website was useless for more info. Plus, this was happening over the weekend and their CSR hours are weekdays. I ended up wasting two sensors thinking that the first one was bad. Now I'm on cycle day 3 with a non-functioning watch and no sensors left. I'm very disappointed in this turn of events. This was way too expensive to fight this much with.On a positive note, the ladies who helped me at Ov-Watch were very nice but could only suggest soaking the sensors for an hour (they are brand-new!!!) and if that didn't work, sending everything back for replacement. They promised replacements before my next cycle... but who wants to wait another cycle? I needed it now and I was counting on it.So... I'm not sure how to rate this product. It worked for one cycle and then went haywire. I would have said that it were more accurate than the Clear Blue Fertility Monitor (since I'm on Clomid, the CBFM gives more ""high"" days than it should); but I cannot say it is better than the CBFM now b/c the CBFM is working and the Ov-Watch is not.And I'm bummed. One more cycle down the tubes."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"Original comments as of Feb 2008While I loved the concept of this chair, I did not find it to be either space saving or very safe. As other reviewers have commented, the chair does not tuck under your table when not in use, so it really saves no space. More importantly, though, when strapped onto my regular dining chair, it is quite top heavy and I can see my baby easily tipping it over. The dining chair in the display photo has an A-frame, with the top of the legs closer together and the bottom of the legs farther apart. My dining chairs do not have that feature, instead having legs that are 90 degrees from the floor. I am returning this chair in order to get a full-sized one that is safer. I would not recommend this chair unless you have an appropriate dining chair with A-frame legs to which you can attach it. And don't expect to save space, although you may save a bit of money, since it costs half the price of a full-sized high chair.***Update as of Oct 2011 Um, I never returned it...May I just sheepishly say, we still have this chair. Can you believe it, after a review like that?? I am upgrading it from three stars to four, since the chair NEVER TIPPED over like I thought it might and it is so durable that it has lasted through two kids. My biggest complaint about it is that it does not slide under the table as a booster chair, which forces a toddler to have to continue to use the tray even though he has long outgrown that need and really just wants to sit at the table with the rest of us. Our solution"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Carlson was a brand recommended to me by my naturopath, so I trust the quality. I only take 1 pill on Sunday because the rest of the week i get about 400 IU's in a multi-vitamin. Make sure you research any kind of supplements before taking them or talk to a doctor you trust. There are negative side effects of overdosing Vitamin D3, that's why I only take this 2000 IU amount once a week, and most likely will not need it in the summer when I get plenty from the sun."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"I bought this pump after having used the Avent Isis. I went to full expression for my baby and ended up spending several hours on the pump everyday, so getting an electric was clearly a must!This pump works, and you don't end up with sore muscles as with the Avent Isis. At the same time, I am not convinced it is as efficient as the Avent Isis... The good point is that I have one hand free when using this pump, which I did not have with the Isis. The bad point is that I probably spend a bit more time with this one than I would need with a better pump. And it is REALLY loud, so there is no way I can watch a DVD while expressing.As I plan to carry on to express several times per day, I am getting a Medela pump in style, everybody says it's a great pump, and the double pumping will no doubt save me time."

Determined to continue using this product, I did a Google search and found the best price on Amazon!Derma E Peptides Plus has a pure, clean smell. This product will literally melt into your skin leaving it feel perfectly moisturized and soft. When I began using the product, I noticed a beautiful change in the tone, texture and over all condition of my skin. As several weeks past, the results were stunning. On a recent cruise, my husband and I met several new acquaintances and asked them to guess my age. To my blessing, they guessed me to be ten years to younger than I really am!I use this product twice a day. Once in the morning after my shower and again right before bed. Derma E Peptides Plus has become my all time favorite facial product. This is the one product that I simply will not do without. I truly believe you will be totally satisfied and pleased."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,After using this deodorant for about a month now I am amazed at the longevity of Lavilin in stopping odor. One particular application lasted for over 5 days and could probably have lasted longer. I am a person who used regular deodorant and had to apply maybe two to three times per day. Another one of my concerns was not getting yet another synthetically chemical infested deodorant. I have terrible allergic reactions to the dyes and what not in normal products. This was really a lifesaver for me. The only real qualm I have with the product is the price per ounce. It comes in at over $20 per ounce (that is more than the price of silver) and you only get 0.44 ounces. Mine only lasted a month without any real strenuous physical activity. And even if it lasts 2 months it would still be double the price of a stick of regular deodorant. My real problem with the deodorant is you can't find it at regular stores. I'm not going to buy a month's worth of deodorant and pay $5 in shipping costs everytime I run out of the miniscule amount that is given.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Market Spice Tea is my favorite tea. Each sip is smooth and sparkly, invigorating and contemplative. It floats across your tongue and then kicks each taste bud into attention. A simplified description is a highly caffeinated smooth black tea with cinnamon and orange spices. It is important to keep this tea in glass jar to keep fresh. I recommend 3 spoons to 4 cups of water and steep for 3-4 minutes only.This tea gives you a smooth ""high"" that is just as strong but longer lasting than coffee. So if you are sensitive to caffeine, limit your intake in the evening. It's perfect for sharing with friends (which is what I do with the 1 lb. bags)."

Thanks, Amazon."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"we switched to these bottles after reading about all the bpa studies. my two month old wasn't sure about them at first. i think switching between nursing and her other bottles and then adding these was a bit confusing for her. when she does take them she does like them. i have two complaints... choice of nipple flow and no one ounce measurement. i chose these vs. the 5 oz bottles b/c they came with the stage 2 nipple which she was taking with her other bottles. however, stage 2 with these nipples is much faster a flow then our other bottles (which are avent). we love the avent bottles, but unfortunately they aren't totally bpa free. the measurement thing comes in handy when she just needs a little more, i wish there was a one ounce measurement marker. overall a great bottle, just wish you could choose the nipple and wish they were more readily available in stores."

health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"The thermometer just did not seem to be very accurate and inconsistent. I used this thermometer about 15-20 times. I tested my son, 7 months, my wife and myself. I cleaned the tip each time and each time the degrees would vary by a couple to 5-7. It also builds up with ear wax which you must clean off with an alcohol wipe each time. So you are either using covers or alcohol wipes.I ended up buying theBraun Gillette Thermoscan In Ear Thermometer IRT4520This item was 100% better and much more accurate."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"I have been using this highchair for about 5 months now and there are so many choices out there, I would not recommend this one. It is easy to clean and does adjust very easily up and down as well as recline back. The features that I do not like are that you have to use two hands to remove the tray and the buckle is so hard to fasten and unfasten. I have caught my finger in it a couple of times and it hurts- god forbid you catch your childs skin in it. My experience with other highchairs having a one handed tray removal as well as secure but harmless belt is much better than this one. Overall not the worst highchair but can find better for the price."

If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the ""blum"" in Jablum)!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,3.0,"Remember these are made to be used with the machine. They are very pricey, in addition to the price of the machine.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"Just a note to remind folks that Maxwell House has changed it's blend and if you order you will probably get the ""new"" MH, which is a stronger ""coffee house"" blend. Not the fault of Amazon. I ordered it in the vacuum bag and was lucky enough to get the original blend. I reordered, but am not sure which will show up. I will say that Amazon does take about a week to ship it out, which seems long to me. If you then add the actual shipping time to that it can be anywhere from 10 days to 2 weeks before you get your order. I am hoping enough people will complain to MH and they will bring back the original blend."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"If you don't put this thing together right, it won't work. Read the instructions very carefully. Once you figure out how all the pieces fit together, it's super easy and quick to assemble. It's manual, so you have to have patience for it to create some pressure. This thing saved my life. At first I wasn't getting pressure, and I was just using it to get my nipple to poke out so that my baby could latch on easily. Then, pressure started to build, and milk was flowing out like a fountain. Once I got the hang of it, it was great. It doesn't hurt, it's small and easy to carry around. The only thing I hated were the 4 oz bottles it came with. They leaked and came with too many pieces (bottle, neck and top). But I don't see those in the picture here, so maybe Avent did away with that. I discovered that regular avent bottles can attach to the pump as well, so that was good."

After trying to use it for 7 nights and a different sound each night I finally gave it up and went back to my earplugs.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I was already addicted to this snack! Thankfully, Amazon suscriber program makes the cost a lot more reasonable. These are great and a lot healthier than ""chips""!!You have to like peas or dried peas as this is the flavor! It is a great, light snack! (I bet this is great on salads too! But, I usually just grab the bag and ""chow down""!)"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I bought this chair because I was tired of having to take sanitizing wipes to the restaurants to clean the high chairs. The straps on those things are alway broken too. This chair folds nicely under the seat in my car and is super sturdy. My son loves it and he can sit up with us like a big boy. Its very stylich and my husband doesnt mind using it because its not ""baby like"". I don't feel like it's going to slip off the table ever and fits on ALL tables. I give this high chair 5 stars!!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,This one was okay. It could of tasted better. I wouldn't buy this flavor again.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,The rice crackers are a greater alternative to the regular crackers. They are much healthier and taste great and you can eat much more for a smaller amount of calories. These are my new favorite crackers.

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"Professional grade sheets that are regular washer and dryer safe, I am all over it! We have washed these sheets a lot and they are holding up very nicely. On the tag it says that they should be line dried...who does that anymore? We toss it in on low heat and they come out very soft and warm. A++"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My nutritionist recommended this product to control the yeast in my body. I tried other natural products with little to no relief. This really works!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"My wife and I have enjoyed the Millstone Colombinan Supremo coffee pods using our Krups coffee maker for about three years now. This Amazon deal for our coffee pods of choice is among the most reasonable we have found. As long as Amazon offers this bulk purchase (six bags of sixteen coffee pods per case) at this price, we'll continue to order them. Yum!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"If you have chronic reflux (get yourself checked out by means of gastroscopy) and always are burning down the throat and eosophogus, then this is like magic. It is very soothing and has long lasting results. You normally take only one a day (it doesn't matter when you take it, although I find that if I take it in the morning, then for the rest of the day I'm fine). If symptoms are more severe (even temporarily more severe) you can take a second pill, although it shouldn't be required as this is so effective.In Australia, this can only be bought by prescription, but I'm glad this is accessable to people who really need it without a script, because usually (though not always) you can be on this kind of medication for a long long time. Don't self diagnose; just because you are getting relief from this, doesn't mean there isn't a reason behind the reflux in the first place, but if you are a sufferer, then this is the best medication there is. With hardly any side effects, it's something almost anyone could take. But do check with your physician if unsure. I get such amazing relief from it, I'm very happy and confident to recommend this. It works so well (and keeps me sane)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"This tea has a nice taste and is pretty comparable to the Foojoy Oolong, which is what I've purchased in the past. However, one thing that should be noted is that the tea is caffeine free - or at least that is what the individual tea bag wrappers state. The product details on Amazon's site do not list this, nor does the box that the tea is packaged in."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love this product. I use it all the time and everywhere I go people stop me to say ""What a great idea!"" or ""I wish they had that when my kids were babies!"" I first used it with my son two years ago and began using it again with my second child last month. I use it everywhere - anytime she needs milk and we're out - in the car, restaurant or even at home if I need to get something done - while she's sitting in the Bumbo or exersaucer. The most convenient time is when we're shopping; She's in the Bjorn and I put the Podee in a water bottle sack - the kind used for cycling - I hook it to the Bjorn (just slip the cinch cord loop on the sack around the Bjorn strap that button snaps) - and wahlah! The bottle is kept warm in the sack, it's up by my shoulder so it's not getting shaken around and in my way, I can shop and when she gets hungry, I don't have to stop, she just eats by holding the nipple part. The only negative is you have to make sure you store the nipple (even if the cap is on) facing up. Otherwise as the straw fills up and leaks everywhere. I've never been patient enough to use the little discs to stop leaking on any bottle. Dangling like shown in the photo, the milk comes out of the nipple hole. Regardless, this product is great and totally worth it!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,"Their spice tea is usually very good and fresh, however, my most recent shipment is probably not very fresh. In a previous shipment of teabags, I noticed that each teabag would quickly flavor a cup and a half of tea, whereas in the shipment I recently received, a bag will barely flavor one cup, and by the time it is well flavored, the tea is cold."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"First of all, let me say that I have been using whey low exclusively in my iced tea, and have totally replaced sugar in my kitchen with this product for several years. I thought is was great, and I can say that of it tastes indistiguishable from sugar. However, a few weeks ago my 12 year old son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal. When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately. We have tried it several times with the same result. I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product. I won't be buying anymore. Sorry it took me so long to find out. It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Love the taste, great for stir frys as well as a great additive to smoothies. I'm in two minds over the health issue though; searching medical journals only seems to show a vast majority of negative results (this stuff *is* mostly saturated fat after all) with a huge number of hits on sites which frankly sell this stuff. I don't know but I felt the need to balance all the glowlingly positive reviews...they jury is still out on whether this stuff really is good for you (hydrogenated coconut oil certainly isn't...this stuff is hopefully different)"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I actually loved this massager, until is stopped working a little over a a week ago. Do you know if I can send this product back? I would love to have one that works. I ordered it on 3/4/08 and it worked for about 3 weeks and then one day I went to turn it on and it just didn't work.*** Update... I emailed the company I bought this from (Chamba). They immediately sent me another one, within 2 days (UPS). I am so happy with this massage. It's built very sturdy! It really helps my fibromyalgia muscles!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I first encountered Shock coffee while deployed to Iraq and it's absolutely wonderful (much better taste than Doubleshot)! When I couldn't find it where I was living in Iraq, I emailed the company asking where I could find it and they sent me a free case (24)!! I would drink one of these before going into some really boring briefings and had no problem staying awake. Overall, great drink (much more oomph than Frappacinos and fewer calories!)....and a wonderful company who made many deployed troops pretty happy."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"Needed something better than water to restore my energy after hot yoga -- this is it! I've always thought sports drinks are nasty (flavor-wise and in terms of what they actually contain), and I never saw the point in wasting money on them when I could eat healthy foods and drink water. So I was delighted to discover this natural alternative that replenishes lost hydration and nutrients quickly.After an hour and a half of yoga poses in a 105-degree room (yes, that sounds like a crazy idea but it does amazing things for the body), I used to feel tired for the rest of the day. Now, after drinking my post-class Zico, I feel like my energy level is completely restored, if not even better than before class! Highly recommend this stuff."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,1.0,I found the plot was short on coherence and the characters lacked depth. Plus it looked like I peed myself when it spilled onto my lap.I do not recommend this product.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I dont know why Medela is not selling this valves with their pumps instead of the two-piece valves. This one is much better and easier to clean, and since it is a one-piece, the pump works great without loosing pressure.The package only include one valve with membrane, you may want to order two.I bought two to have them as spare valves, and now I prefer them over the ones that came with Medela Pump In Style.Great product"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I bought the bebepod chair for my son. At the time he was 3 months old. He was beginning to want to sit up all the time, so I thought he would love this chair. At first he would slide in the chair and slump to the side. He is now 4 months and he sits up great in it. He loves the toy. The tray is a must, it helps hold him in. I have tried to use the chair without the tray, but he is able to stretch himself out of the chair. If you are going to buy the chair, I would definately recommend only getting the one with the tray."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"I had a great SAD lite but it was so huge. I read about this and it sounded great. Specifically the long battery life and portability. Well if you have blue eyes you better look for something else. I learned the hard way that many people with blue eyes get MIGRAINES from the blue light. YEP, happened to me. Then I tried to use it without the power and it only held a 30 min charge with 36 hours being plugged in. SAD to say it was not what I had high hopes of. So back it went. I'm Glad Amazon stands behind the products they sell and this was defective also since it didn't hold a charge as stated."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,1.0,This had a very miled flavor. Neither my husbund or I liked without adding something to it. There was no cooking instrcutions which meant I had to guess. Boiled like white rice for 30 minutes came out good. I would not buy again.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,salsas,5.0,"Not too hot, but hot enough (unless you are the type to put hot sauce on everything). It has a great citrusy tang to it. excellent with chips, as a taco topping etc."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"Although these muffins are not the best instant muffins out there, they can be prepared with just adding 1/2 cup of water, which makes them a necessity to have around the house when you have run out of milk (or have noticed that the milk's expired) but still need to make something for breakfast/snack time!The banana flavor is a little weak, so I either add mashed bananas to the batter and bake it as a loaf, or add banana extract to try and punch up the flavor a bit.Note that one package only makes 6 muffins."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,This is not my favorite coffee but I'm still giving it 4-stars. To me it taste a lot like the Starbucks coffee that hotels and conferences put in those giant coffee pots for the public.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,2.0,"This rice had mixed reviews at out house. One person hated it, two thought it was ok and one liked it becasue of the strong nutty flavor. There was no cooking instructions and I think mom cooked it like wild rice for 45 minutes."

There are two reasons why people change behavior"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,This dessert tea is so tasty. Add milk and sugar for a delightful treat!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. They Both were made in the citrate form. Unfortunately, I am unable to absorb properly for my system. Although the instructions say to take 2 level teaspoons per serving, I tried 1 teaspoon and soon after, had cramps and had to run to the bathroom. I tried this more than once and the same thing happened. I also do not like the way it does not dissolve in liquids easily. It is gritty and if left in the glass for a few seconds, falls to the bottom.Anyway, thought this would be a good product for me, but is not. I guess I may have to get a softgel or capsule type."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"A coffee that has good taste, light but having a slight kick, and I find that having more than one cup, is gentle on my digestive system, with no ill after taste, or problems with having to much, that with some coffee may give you an acid problem, and uncomfortable feeling.One of my favorites. I have make sure that I don't drink to much. An I do like caffine to wake me up!Teri Daner"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I read in a health magazine that this product is better for you than aspertame (which can cause thyroid symptoms),sucrose( because sucrose is sugar)or saccarine. I have no proof of that but I thought I would give it a try since my hair has been falling out from too much aspertame.It tasts good. I can use less than a full package because of it's extra sweetness. It is a plant product and supposedly causes no health problems..Zero calories. I can say that since I started using this product two months a go, my hair stopped falling out which is proof to me it is better for me."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I like both quality and pattern a lot. well cushioned for head and sides. could have more cushion on seat too, but baby looks pretty comfortable sitting on it for quite a while. It fades a little with washing, but I just have to wash it very often. If you have no ""messy"" eater it may look like new for years! And as I mentioned above, I like pattern a lot. It looks so refreshing after surfing through all plaid and solid colors available on the market."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The Natures Bounty 1000mg softgels are standardized to be fully potent.For some reason, Propalmex, who lead this product category and had the finest standardized extract is no longer available. Natures Bounty has filled the void with this product that works equally well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I reviewed this product before the ""improved"" version here was introduced. One plus is that Vit D was added but still a poor ca++ supplement:1. Not USP tested for actual quality (unless I missed that somewhere on the label)2. Really only 40% of the 200mg per serving is absorbed from the type of calcium used.Alas I am still looking for a kid supplement for calcium that a kid will take (my daughter also doesn't care for the fruit or choclate chews that have a citrate or carbnate calcium).I did find one called Yummi bears (?) that looked a little better....But still not exactly what I want."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This product mixes poorly, remaining gritty even after vigorous shaking. This grit will quickly settle to the bottom requiring more shaking. Furthermore it caused an unpleasant sharp sensation in the back of my throat. Worst of all, from day one it caused copious amounts of extreamly sulphurous flatulence and some loose stool. By day four it had become diarrhea. I cannot recommend this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been taking these vitamins for about 4 years now. I try to take them every day, although I go through short stints of spacing them out. After about a week or so I start to feel a little extra sluggish, and remember to myself, oh yea, I never took my vitamins. I almost immediately can feel them do there nourishing job in a few hours or so. They are really packed full with a great complex blend of herbs, green foods, mushroom blend, bioflavinoids...Anyway, I'm not being paid to write this review, I'm just endorsing a product that I definitely feel provides quality nutrition to your body."
health personal care,health care,allergy,2.0,"Neti Pots are amazing - I was a total non-believer, but it really works. This particular one is very cheaply made and has a very large spout for the nostril. You don't need pre-made solution either - just use table salt and warm water. Buy another one!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"Da Vinci Sugar Free Syrups with Splenda. There are over 30 different flavors. Trust me when I say that only a handful of all those flavors available is worth the price. English Toffee, French Vanilla are winners. I am sure there are a couple more but I am not going to spend good money on other flavors that are not even worth .50 cents. B-52 is one! How did it come to me? I do not recall ordering that particular flavor and they probably send it by mistake (we'll see when I ask for my money back. Over [$...] each cost!). Hard to describe the taste but enough said that when I added some to an otherwise superior cop of coffee this crap made me pour it all-minus that first sip-down the drain. B-52? What's that, an airplane? Because it sure does not taste normal to me! The aftertaste is enough to make you want to demand your money back! Yes, there are many but only the very few are worth the price."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,We broke two of these before we gave up and bought a digital one. Because you have to shake it hard to get it ready to use it's very easy to drop it. And you only have to drop it once for it to shatter. The product works like it is supposed to but digital is much less of a hassel.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"This is exactly the right size for me for the amount of medications I ever expect to take. At first, I had trouble getting the compartments to open.The problem is that by pressing your finger or thumb against the side of the box to slide up to catch the edge of the lid where it sticks out for opening, you are pressing in on the side keeping the little projection on the lid that holds it shut from popping out of the little depression inside that it needs to pop out of. Sorry that I can't describe that better.The manufacturer tries to guide you around this by having an arrow and the word ""LIFT"" imprinted on the _corner_ of the lid to direct you away from putting pressure on the middle of the side and blocking your own efforts. If you limit your contact to the end or corner of the lifting tab it works fine.Some ""hot rodding"" suggestions for those of you who want to improve your pill cases. First, when it's time to reload, I just twist the entire four compartment section to get all four to open at once. Then I make sure all the lids are exactly straight up. That way, when I put it back in the base, its lids don't block the next compartments over. With all 28 compartments open I can load up a week surprisingly fast.Additional loading suggestions. Have any simple med/large pair of tweezers handy. Pills sometimes bounce out of one compartment to another.Fastest loading, I've found, is to either get a small round bottom cup or use the palm of your hand. Pour a little more than the amount of pills you expect to need into it. Then hold that next to each compartment as you go by. Going back and forth to piles of pills to the side turns out to be the most time consuming part of the operation. Take the pills to the boxes.Since I plan for accidents, I put a convenient size rubber band going around the length of each days set. When they are in the storage base, I put it around horizontally just under the lids so it doesn't get in the way of putting the loaded set of boxes back into the base.When I take the day's set out for bedside or to go with me away from home, I move the rubber band around to cover the open sides of the lids about 6mm/quarter inch in from the open side. This gives a sort of ""spring loaded"" effect to the lids. If I drop the box on the floor, everything stays inside. But it's easy to hold the lid open against the pressure of the band.When a day is empty, I leave the band vertical and wedge the box back in the base. That makes it easy to separate the used from the ready to go. (I confuse easy.) If you need to separate some boxes from others, I would suggest coloring the _INSIDE_ of the lids with permanent markers in different colors. That way the colors won't wipe off as easily.Good luck, three more will let me do a month at a time. I've been wanting this for a long time."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've been ""addicted"" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea. I put forth Licorice Spice as my favorite and she said her all time favorite was, surprisingly enough, a tea made by Aveda - the haircare company - called Comforting Tea. She lamented that she found it hard to find and described the taste to me. I immediately told her that she had to try Licorice Spice then. A few days after my recommendation she emailed me that she had tried the Stash tea and it was EVEN BETTER than the Aveda one! I so do love making converts!As an added bonus, I've discovered after many nights of letting the tea steep, forgetting about the cup I've made, but not wanting to waste the tea bag - it tastes really good cold too!"

It covers most of the area in front of her high chair and suctions to the table so it stays in place.

Less lands in her lap! Everytime we use this, we have parents asking us where to get it! It rolls up easily and fits conveniently into our seat cover case. I would definitely recommend this to new mom's."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying, I've always had back problems. When I was a teenager, I had muscular pain from over-exertion (re-arranging my bedroom, etc) and slowly, over the years, the pain became more serious when it came.Twice in the last ten years, I've been completely debilitated by sharp, excruciating pain (possibly a pinched nerve, or bulging disk) and would be relegated to laying on the floor, immobile for about a week. Not moving at all, getting up to even crawl to the bathroom was nearly impossible, so I'd eat and drink as little as possible.Last week, I started feeling that familiar sharp twinge in my lower to mid back and started to worry that it was about to go out.I'm an ICU nurse, so I work 12-14 hour shifts without stopping, rolling very heavy sedated patients several times a night. I can't call in sick because we're so short staffed.I bought this thing on ebay (for about $20 with shipping) and thought, if it works, great; if not, I'll throw it in the recycle bin.Let me tell you, honestly, it's amazing.At first, I laid on it and thought--ok, this is going to be tough.I'm 5'10"" tall, and weigh 140 pounds. I think this might not work for people who are very heavy or have a big musculature, but I'm small/tall enough that this thing fits me well, and I don't exert too much downward force on my own frame.I also have no butt (sadly, I'm working on it)so I have to bend my knees and plant my feet on the ground to elevate my backside a bit. This with the pillow under my head as recommended by the instructions, and a little minor adjusting up and down to find the right part of the curve, and INSTANTLY I felt a stretching and heard a few pops that felt amazing and relieving.After only about 10 minutes on the thing I stood up and felt half my age. My back hasn't felt this good since I was in my early 20s!!!I'm never going to be without this thing, and now when I head back to grad school, this thing is the first thing I'm packing in my suitcase.Don't take my word for it--try it out, you can return it if it doesn't work for you, but if it does work...my goodness, how wonderful!I'm so happy I could skip for joy!!:D"

This same product as a single pack (instead of this double pack) didn't get such great reviews because some people said the test holder was not reusable. I really want something extremely reliable, as I have an extremely irregular and unpredictable cycle. I would love to use this, but not if the test holder is not reusable. Can anyone let me know for sure if it is or not?? Can I buy this and then in the future only have to buy the clear blue test strips without any holders?? Help!"

I was able to stop using Afrin multiple times per week to keep my sinuses open. I suffer from sleep apnea, but this has had the desired effect. Just wish they'd always stay in my nose all night, they pop out sometimes and they are hard to find in the bedding."

These days I mainly drink water, but I enjoy putting a little of this concentrate either in carbonated water or just tap water for a little flavor. And a bottle will last you FOREVER. Great stuff!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"If you've had issues with bladder infections, give this stuff a try. It's a natural, preventative, healthy way of dealing with what can otherwise be a painful problem. If you've tried other things and keep having problems, give this a try. Given that it's just a cranberry extraxt, it can't hurt!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I found these in my local grocery store, and apparently I bought them out and they havne't come back in stock yet, so.......Amazon to the rescue. These are good for you, loaded with fiber, low carb, low fat, cruchy, a nice little bit of wasabi flavor. Great option instead of chips or peanuts. If you are on a low carb diet, you get only 2 g net carbs per 1/4 cup. GOod Snack!! They aren't eveyones taste, but i think they are delicious."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I was so happy to send this dish set to a tenant in congratulations for the birth of their new little one. It is such a practical gift, warm, but not too personal. Just right for a business relationship welcome gift to a new baby. It is really darling and not pink or blue for a change. The green is very attractive."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I have had gastric bypass and I have tried a lot of protein mixes and this one is the best every once I found this one I haven't had to try another one again. This one dissolves and isn't chalky. It tastes like choc milk. I use only non fat milk cause it does make your milk thicker and that's ok for me. I used to have this 3 times a day but now I only need it for breakfast and it is feeling and satisfying until I have my first break at work. And now that I found it on Amazon it mails out to me and I don't have to worry the store is going to be out any more and it was cheaper then in the store. Yea for me! And it has very low sugar and high protein. Try it you might like it.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I like hot & spicy cuisines. This is one of my favorite ramen. It is very hot & spicy. It provide seafood taste, too. In addition it it very convenient to cook. Boiling is all skill to cook this ramen. It takes more time to cook than any other ramen such as Shin ramen, because its noodle is thicker."
health personal care,health care,allergy,2.0,"The first time I used this was at night, right before bed. Big mistake! When I woke up the next morning, my inner ear felt really painful, and blowing my nose magnified the pain.Afterwards, I decided to only use it in the daytime. However, I still get small painful sensations in my ears as soon as I blow my nose right after using the neti pot. I hear really loud ""scratching"" noises deep in my head as I blow my nose, and it takes about thirty minutes for the pain and sounds to go away.The packaging says that if your Eustachian tubes are larger than normal, you should cease use of the neti pot. I guess the SinuCleanse Nasal Wash system isn't for me!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"On a gluten free diet, the selection of normal side dishes is limited to rice, potatoes or rice noodles. Overall, this spices up the rice alternative a bit. I have tried different flavors of the Lundberg Risotto, this one is the most spicy with bounds of flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This flavor of Nectar is described as ""fruit punch"" but it reminds me more of Berry flavored Kool-Aid or Gatorade. I personally liked the flavor and would probably get it again but with the sample I got there was a LOT of clumping, that even using a shaker bottle wouldn't dissolve. Different batches and flavors of Nectar definitely seem to have differing abilities to dissolve, so I may have just got a bad batch, but it was very frustrating as the flavor otherwise I liked. There is only a slight aftertaste and none of the strong whey protein taste than many protein powders have. If you're not a fan of Gatorade drinks you would probably want to pass this one up regardless and try some of the other Nectar flavors instead. You can find my review covering all the Nectar flavors I have tried HERE."

I opened it up and started using it on everything...it is absolutely the best-tasting sauce out there- the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Once you try it, it will be a hit for your get-togethers as well. I ordered a case and have started giving the bottles away every once in a while for special occasions. It is always a hit!"

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,"This cup's straw assembly includes a BPA part, so it wouldn't be legal in Canada. I have no idea why it's in Amazon's BPA-free store.Also, I bought one of these for my son before I knew Nuby's abysmal BPA record and campaign of misinformation to consumers. I noticed that my son always chewed the straw (the silicone part, not the BPA part which is inside). One day I took a drink of his juice and it turns out you have to bite the straw to get liquid out.Also, when the child has taken a drink and snapped the lid closed, the straw, upon reopening, will shoot a notable amount of beverage toward and above the opener.I threw ours out."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I had minor knee surgery a couple years back and have had slight discomfort in my knee ever since. especially after a long workout. Filling and ice pack, sitting in one place, and holding it against my knee for at least 30 minutes several times a week seemed unconventional. This knee wrap made the process so much easier. I simply leave it in my freezer and when needed, i wrap it around my knee. I don't need to be sitting in one place either with my hands tied holding it in place. My only complaint is with the material inside the wrap. It seems to shift around too easily deforming the shape of the wrap. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the product."

UPS stated as well as amazon that my item was out for delivery. when i Called UPS they said call Amazon. Amazon said I had to wait 7 days. So on the 7th day (no i did not rest) I tries Amazon again. The Sales Rep was great and had it rush shipped in less then 2 days no extra charge.This was subscription so hopefully the one due May 30th comes with out me having to hunt it down.cans were in mint condition all taste wonderful!

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I liked this high chair from the pictures online and when I got it, I was pleased that it looked exactly the same as in the pictures. I love the patchwork cow print of the seat (I have the pack 'n play and the swing also from this collection). The seat cushion, however, is a little too loose. It should have a couple more reinforcement elastics on the upper back somewhere. It is really easy to clean (seat, cushion, tray, everything), the tray clicks into place nice and tight, and it's relatively sturdy overall. I don't think it's worth the price, though, which is why I'm only giving this chair 4 stars (well, that and the loose seat cushion). I love that the chair is simple...those newfangled high chairs are just a waste. The recline feature was nice for when my son was in the early stages of spoon feeding, but it's a silly feature for anything after that so we haven't used it since he was 4 months old and we won't use that feature again, probably."

To keep your blood reaching everywhere in particular to your brain, other extremities, and most importantly coursing through your heart you must take Omega 3 Fatty Acids with your diet. The reason for this admonisment is we are eating less and less wholesome, higly processed foods. If your diet is rich with seafood you are already there, otherwise take good cod liver oil as a daily supplement.If you have five decades or more behing you, it's all the more compulsory to take a good fish oil.You ill you feel or observe when you take a teaspoon of this stuff on a daily basis"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have been experimenting with pods in my Breville to save money. The pods (used in the pod holster) are hit or miss. The Senseos don't seem to have enough coffee in them to stack up well in the holster. Then I found these Gloria Jeans cups. Sure, they cost a little more than the pods, but they work a whole lot better. I get a much richer cup of coffee and can even use them for the largest size on the Breville and still maintain plenty of flavor. It makes sense that these machines will make the best coffee when using the proprietary equipment rather than cutting corners to save a few cents. Great flavor variety and delicious taste."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I have had problems with my back for over the last two years. I have had pain in the upper back region and sometimes in the lower back but not as often. I used this 30minutes a day and it has helped lower my discomfort in the lower and upper back areas. I can hear some of my vertebres pop so it did something and is not bad for the price better than going to the chiropractor at least for me. Chiros couldn't fix my problem misaligned vertebres and its cheaper than paying 35-50 bucks an adjustment. I'm also wondering if chiro can do an adjustment on this device rather than the table which would give my back some more popping power.

It keeps my very oily with a dry surface skin very smooth - even using it sparingly - and has allowed me to be able to use powdered mineral makeup. I will not be without the Radiance!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"It's got to be the lemongrass that makes the difference. I've tried all kinds of green tea and none has ever been so refreshing, thirst-quenching and smooth! As iced tea with nothing added, it's my favorite complement to a meal."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,2.0,"Sorry, but I didn't like this rice. White or brown basmati rice has much more aroma and flavor. I also didn't care for the texture...the hull remained crunchy even after an hour of cooking. I pitched the rest of it...a waste of money."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either. Below is the main nutritional info:Calories 180Total Fat 5gSat fat 2gSodium 250mgCarbs 30gFIBER 6gPROTEIN 9g"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is the first Whey Protein I started drinking, and I like the vanilla flavor, which is very versatile and you can mix with an expresso and it tastes like Frapucchino or Coffee ice cream, you can also add some cinnamon and oats and tastes like oatmeal shake which I love, I drink it with nonfat milk and mix it in a blender. I like that it is sweetened with both Acesulfame K and Sucralose, not just Acesulfame K giving it a more natural sweet taste. I also tasted Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey, and this one has a richer taste, but both are good. The amount of protein per serving is on par with other top brands."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,Bought the pre~seed along with the 20 OV sticks combo for $30 and WOW. Conceived the first month trying with it!!

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"they really should Promote the fact that this is an organic tea. that fact alone would attract more people to give it a shot.i drink and serve tea every single day. only loose-leaf teas, never anything in a bag.compare this tea with Adagio's dragonwell tea. compare it also with Peet's Tea. i believe this tea to be of slightly lower quality than Peet's. About the same as Adagio. but half the price of either. plus, it's organic!for the best tasting pot of tea you should rinse the leaves for about 20-30 seconds first. use hot water- the same temperature that you will use for making the tea. you can steep the leaves 3 times for good, flavorful pots of tea. add about a minute to each successive steep. i tend to go with 1.5 minutes, 2.5 minutes, then 3.5 minutes. works for me.perhaps because it's organic, its sweetness actually comes through more boldly than its characteristic nuttiness. my students love it as well and have commented consistently on how much MORE they like THIS brand to the others i have bought.dragonwell is, by far, my favorite green tea. i've paid as much as $65/lb. in the past because i like it so much.from now on i am very happy to buy from Special Teas. very impressive!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,Everyone in my family has to have warm feet to go to sleep! We have several of the Bigger Rectangle Shaped Happy Company warmer ... and I bought this small one for my granddaughter. We heat it in the microwave for 2 minutes and it is EXACTLY the right temperature to keep her feet warm. It is well made and we have had no problem with stinkiness that another reviewer mentioned!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I'll start with something good. The shape helps my daughter keep the milk coming. As in, even if she's not holding it perfectly (she's only 4 months), the angle still allows for formula to flow. Very advantagous when you need a minute to do something with the other hand while she's eating. They also have a nice wide opening. That helps with scooping formula into the bottle, rather than around it.On the other hand, there are too many parts. A simple one piece bottle is much easier and faster to clean and dry than the extra pieces found in these. And, no they don't do much about swallowing air. Who said it was bad for babies to swallow air anways?And last, but most importantly, I've found nothing that says these are BP-A free, so as soon as I get my new bottles, these are getting trashed."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"The name Rainbow popcorn inplies that the popped corn will be mult-colored. It pops white and in small ""tight"" kernels. It ""chews"" and tastes a little OLD! I also ordered ""baby white"" at the same time--I found it unsatisfactory too. It pops small (as expected from name?) and is heavy. I won't order from this company again."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"This sauce is phenomenal. It is not runny or overly vinegary (like most low carb sauces). It clings to the meat very well. And a little goes a long way. Personally, I prefer to cook the meat with a good rub and finish off in the last few minutes with Smokin' Joe Jone's low carb sauce."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I really like these bottles. I just gave them to my six month old son who has always used plastic bottles. He immediately liked them and had no trouble adjusting. In addition, I was so very pleased to be able to put them in the dishwasher with all other stuff. I did not do this with the plastics and I was washing them all the time. Beasides, all the hight-tech talk about air intake, I think that because these bottles are much more narrow, there is less surface area exposed and there is less of an air intake sound as he drinks it. I would highly recommend these bottles!!!Not only there are reports of the side effects of BPA, I think everything tastes better in glass!!!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"If you like pretzels and you like hot wings. Do yourself a favor and try these. You will not believe how much like a true hotwing they made these pretzels taste.Oh and to the 3 star reviewer who didn't like that they are hot. Umm they don't call them cool wings. They are not hot, but do have a spice to them. If you are someone that eats hotwings you will love them."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"I ordered this specifically for a recipe for Chi Chi's seafood enchiladas/Cancun on Recipe Zaar. The recipe consistently got five stars rating. It called for a tablespoon of lobster base (for a half recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, adding no salt and using no salt butter. The dish was so salty that we threw it out. Later, while trying to figure out what went wrong I found that this particular lobster base has 800 mg of sodium per tsp. So, I had used 2400 mg of sodium in a recipe for 4-6 enchiladas. We like salt--too much sometimes--but this was beyond the pale!! Now, I've got 2 jars of this base and doubt I'll ever use it. What a disappointment! Just be careful!11/3/2012 After quite a long time I decided to try this lobster base again. Definitely YES, other reviewers were right. I had put too much and it is easy to put too much. I find that I can put lots of the same manufacturers chicken broth in a dish and not have to worry too much about salt. Not so with this product. Just be careful and go slowly with it. I don't dilute it with water but rather with one of the other liquids used.I'll order more when I run out."

Genesis should tell the public that Noni is nicknamed 'The vomit fruit'. There is a reason for that. My husband won't even help me choke down the other five bottles. I would only buy one bottle first to see if you can stand the taste. The company isn't the problem, fast delivery, nothing broken. The product tastes like a dead thing smells!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"Well, this is about half the price of the foot and calf massager they had in Brookstone and other stores that sell superfluous necessities. I purchased this as a gift back in July '08. The recipient loves it and uses it twice daily. So far, it's been a dream for an elderly woman with diabetes.The only con is the shipping, which is a bit high and was so before the gas hike.If anything happens within the next year or so, I'll update the review.(Also, previewing this review, it reads that I'm writing it on May 10, '08. That's incorrect. I'm writing this on Oct. 1, '08. My computer time and date is good, so I'm assuming this is a problem on the Amazon side.)Addendum"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"This set should've come out last year as that was the actual 50th anniversary of the debut of the Perry Mason tv series. Still, better late than never. An interesting assortment of episodes, including a beautiful transfer of the only color episode ""The Case of the Twice Told Twist"". Ironically, that looked better than the transfer of ""Perry Mason returns"", the reunion tv-movie from December 1985. I loved all the extras, whether it was the screen tests to the introductions by Barbara Hale & Arthur Marks to William Talman's posthumous anti-smoking message. It's not quite an easter egg but, if you blink you might miss the fact that Hale & Marks provide commentary for ""The Case of the Deadly Ringer"". I would've loved for CBS/Paramount to have included an episode of ""The New Perry Mason"" starring Monte Markham in the set as the odds of that short-lived series seeing the light of day on dvd are slim and none, and slim just walked out the door. Now, if only CBS/Paramount would start releasing future seasons in complete sets as opposed to this vol.1/vol.2 nonsense."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"Unlike Preparation H and similar over-the-counter creams sold in the US (which are way too weak and do nothing for me), this one actually does something. I have thrombosed hemorrhoids which produce some of the most severe pain imaginable. Even prescription-only American creams like Lidocaine HCl 3% are totally useless for me.This Chinese cream actually does help with the pain a little bit, not a whole lot, but it cools the swelling and there is some relief. It's the first ointment I've tried that does something. As the previous poster said, it's like applying an ice cube to the area, with some anti-swelling agents. Expect some immediate relief, though partial.Hemorrhoids, particularly thrombosed ones, are a serious matter that requires strong painkillers like Ibuprofen and Percoset (there's not a lot that topical creams can do). But this particular cream can be used in conjunction, for maximum relief with the swelling. Recommended."

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,Probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long while. I saw this on Oprah and decided to give it a shot. My initial reaction on using this Neti pot was gross but make NO Mistake! It cleans out your sinuses and for me made me feel like a new person. Not only could I breathe better but I can sleep better. I started using it once a day in the morning and then I also use it at night usually a half hour before I go to bed. It's a strange feeling when you first use it so follow the directions carefully and remember to breathe out of your mouth (it truly will come out through the other side)! Just put your face parallel to the sink and rotate. Give it a shot - you'll be glad you did!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,I love this tea. I was grateful to have the decaf version for late at night. It is a fragrant delicious way to end the day. A much better way to purchase it rather than going through the stash website.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is perhaps the most flavorful and refreshing tea I have had before calling it a night. The directions call for a 10-15 min soaking time and it truly does make a difference for the richness of the tea. The product is appropriately named ""Throat Coat"" as I have always found it a soothing experience whenever my throat is dry or irritating."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,This product is a little messy due to it's color but does seem to aid in the healing of superficial abrasions and wounds. It is also painless.

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I loved this product when trying for my daughter, who is now 20 months old. I had to wait 6 months after a failed pregnancy to try again and I wanted the best way to detect ovulation. This works, but you have to use it. I gave one to my boss and she used it sporadically and probably incorrectly and then complained that it didn't work. I used it daily, morning and evening and could see definite pattern changes. When the ferning is there it is obvious. I got pregnant in 2 months."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,3.0,"This is not bad, but be aware there is relish added to it. It tends to stop up, then come out in massive quantities."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"These are high in protein and other nutrients such that they make a useful snack or meal replacement. They would be improved if Odwala has not added salt.Taste is, of course, subjective, but I find these barsa) limp and soggy, and they sometimes stick to the roof of one's mouthb) having a smell reminding one of old fashioned health food storesTheir very tastelessness is an advantage in that you won't be tempted to one of these until you really need to."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"These are the best natural/organic type meal bar. Mainly for taste/texture and price. If you like chocolate chip cookies with a tiny,tiny bit of Reeses peanut butter cup thrown in...these are for you."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"My husband absolutely loves this stuff but I couldn't find it in any stores. In fact, the local grocery told me Campbell's no longer made it. So I was thrilled to be able to order it for him on Amazon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"i've tried many probiotics and this is the best. i tried one other that was equally good, but none better. Ironically i just tried five-lac and i don't think i benefited as much from that as this, the original three-lac."

For some reason Costco only carries the frosted variety. My only complaint is that all of us (my family) wish there was more of the fruit filling."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,EDITED REVIEW
health personal care,health care,stimulants,5.0,"This gum offers a really quick boost of energy and alertness. Just chew for 5 minutes to get 100 mg of caffeine (about the same as an 8 oz up of coffee). The five pieces per pack make it really easy to carry with you. It is especially convenient in the car, when you need to wake up and don't want to stop for coffee and/or don't want to fill your bladder (thereby necessitating another stop later). The gum has a pleasant cinnamon flavor with just a hint of bitterness -- not an unpleasant bitterness, but it's there. It is made with sugar and I've noticed no aftertaste. This product does exactly what it claims."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,MY GRAND BABY LOVES THIS SEAT. IT IS SO SOFT FOR HER. SHE IS VERY TINY FOR 3 AS SHE WAS A PREMIE. I LOVE IT AS IT IS EASY TO TAKE WITH ME AND EASY TO CLEAN. THANKS FOR MAKING A GREAT COMFY BOOSTER SEAT.JULIE STUTZMAN
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I use this yeast in bread machine baking and it is the best yeast on the market.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,This is the perfect solution for a sore neck. As I get older it seems I have lost a bit of flexibility in my neck - I work out all the time and this is the best neck device that I have found. Only bad thing is that you will get hot when using heat in summer. But for the relief anyone can stand it for five - ten minutes.Highly recommend
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,We've been using this highchair for 2 1/2 years. I love it so much I'm reluctant to get rid of it now that my daughter no longer needs a high chair.What's great about this chair:Looks GreatCleans Easily (I much prefer the fabric seat cover to plastic because I can just throw it in the wash.)Has a tray insert that can be removed and dish washer cleaned.It's sturdy.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have bought many bottles of multi-vitamins over my children's life time, only to have to throw them out because my kids will not eat them!!! These are easier to eat than the regular gummies, softer and chewier, not hard and rubbery. They also like the sugar-like coating. Now they remind ME when it is time to take their vitamins!!! We got on the automatic subscription so we never run out. Free shipping and cheaper than at the grocery store."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is my first yoga mat and I am very pleased with it so far--it's durable, has just enough cushioning and it is very non-slip. The mat is a fantastic value for the price!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I was very happy with the delivery of my purchase. The product came protected, and was in good shape when it arrived."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"We just got back from Bali and was looking for the Bali ""Kecup"" checked my local market- Cost Plus etc and was unable to find it. Thought about where on line I could find this unique product and thought of Amazon. Looked and foudn the sauce and it is perfect- - time for some Nasi Goreng!!!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"This is a really good product, I bought it because I was moving out of country and I was going to be doing quite a bit traveling with my then 6 month old girl. This chair has been all over Ecuador & Europe. It folds flat like a medium size pizza box, it fits in my diaper bag. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it can't be used with glass or pedestal tables. Other than that is nice & useful luxury to have."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,This is a great product. I try to stock up as much as possible. The flavors are tart and spicy. The best in comparison to other similar products.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,4.0,"This is a fairly decent package with an uneven distribution. Instead of receiving 10 cups of each product as one might anticipate, the box has twice the number of cups of Frosted Flakes and about six cups of Cocoa Puffs. Unfortunately, the Raisin Bran Crunch is the spoiler in this package. The raisins are tough, difficult to chew, and lay on the bottom of the cup so don't expect to find any raisins until the cereal is just about gone."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,This tool is a must have for those who have knots. It is very easy to use and comes with a small instuction booklet to help you target common areas. I love the mini-BBB. I use it all the time when I am in the car driving to target my tense shoulder muscles.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"After a month, I saw little to no results, plus gained 7 lbs exactly, just like the other reviewer who gave this 1 star. I'm very fit and exercise consistently. My weight has been stable for years, so this is very disappointing."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I throw these in my suitcase, along with my organic milk, for a quick breakfast. With these, you don't need an extra bowl because they're already in a bowl!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Really good product, numbs the area that aches. I am using for bulged discs in lower back and is great for pain relieving. little expensive but worth it."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"Well, this seat does the job and my son loves it. The two drawbacks are that my husband has to hold the seat up whenever he uses the bathroom...also when I go to empty the mop bucket sometimes I forget and get splashed with dirty water and the shape of it is a little strange. Instead of a nicely downward curved shape it sort of curves up. I've pretty much gotten used to it and the benefits definetly outweigh the negatives. It's a good seat, well made and I would recommend it."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"The Lumiscope 2210-214 Quick-Read Digital Thermometer fits comfortably in the mouth, is very easy to use, registers the result quickly, and seems to provcide an accurate reading of temperature (I compared it to the reading on a traditional mercury thermometer). The only small complaint is the low sound it emits when it reaches the final temperature -- the sound is so difficult to hear that I was not sure the final reading had been reached."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I didn't give five stars because they do leak occasionally (although it is difficult to tell whether it is due to user error) and the system with the provided #2 nipples provided a slow/difficult nursing experience for my three month old. I tried sucking and had a hard time getting much out as well.The good news is that Avent nipples fit with this bottle, and given the outrageous prices for replacement nipples for the Mam system, this is a godsend. The Avent #3 nipples are easily found in stores and provide the perfect draw for my baby. These bottles are not perfect, but I think that they are the best of the BPA free options. I tried and researched the other BPA free bottles on the market and the others were either too expensive or inferior products."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This product is exceptional. The wrap is easily utilized, and there is no problem putting it on."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"I have a kuerig coffe maker and started ordering pods from Amazon because I didn't have to order 10 cases like other places to get free shipping. However, many of the Timothy's brand cups that I ordered from Amazon have burst in the coffee brewer. Which is a pain, because not only is the coffee expensvie and 40 cents a pod, when it breaks it gunks up the coffee maker and has to be taken apart and cleaned. I have not had it happen with any other brand, like Paul Newmans or Emeril's ...once or twice with Green Mountain. So I am disppointed with Timothys quality control. The coffee Morning Blend is one of the weaker cups also, even though it says extra bold."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This is great agave nectar. My only complaint is that I wish it came in bigger bottles. I use ALL the time.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Definitely portable wherever you need it. The taste is a bit like lemon juice when mixed with water. I'd like to pour more than the suggested doze to grasp the flavor to feel the energy to surface from within my body. Factory sealed. Unbeatable long shelf live (10 years).
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter. She was dry after 2 weeks! Then tried it on my 4 year old son who had only stayed dry 5 times total in his life. He has been dry since the 4th night! I recommend this product to all of my friends who are having trouble with night time training. It worked faster than I ever could have imagined!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"It tastes good, almost like Cream Soda, but it didn't give me the buzz that I expect from energy drinks. I could take this one or leave it..."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"Well first off these tended to be leaky. The bottom had to be screwed on super tight not to leak, then it would be difficult to unscrew to clean. And it must be unscrewed everytime you wash it or milk gets caught in it. Also my son didn't take to the nipples. So we used the avent w/these, but though the avent appeared to fit, they often leaked by the nipple w/the avent nipples. Perhaps if your baby likes these nipples and you don't mind the bottom part then they would work for you. Oh yeah I bought them to save looking for a cheaper bpa free bottle w/a wide neck. I think I should have just gone w/the Born Free to start with =)!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"Makes a good lunch, especially with the addition of a bit of milk and butter."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I tried this after years of being a ""no cake mix"" snob. found it in south carolina, and can't find it up here in n.j. it is delicious. everyone who tastes it loves it. and it's embarrassingly easy. tip"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Pure Citrimax works for me for the following reasons:1. It is not mixed with massive ammounts of stimulants like caffeine, guarana or ephedrine. That means speciffically that it won't affect my moods or my sleep. Also, does not contain chromium, which can interfere with insulin. No side effects, period!2. It does help maintain healthy weight. This is not a rapid weight lossproduct, but I would say you can loose about seven pounds per month. Rapid weight loss is not healthy!3. It is also a mild appetite suppressant so it helps me eat more sensibly.Just keep in mind that using any diet product should not be used as an excuse or reason to not exercise or eat a balanced diet!!!C.P."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I love healthy food, and this is a perfect choice for me. The taste is sooo good, even better than high calory snacks and cookies, and this one is only 90 cal per bar. I love all flavor from the Special K Bar, but blueberry is my favorite..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"It isn't bad, I've just tasted better (Max Muscle). The quality of the protein though is good, and if I hadn't had tried Max Muscle prior to this, I'd have thought it was very good.It mixes easily with water in a shaker and has a good (better than average) flavor. When you add additional ingredients (peanut butter powder, frozen fruit, or powdered cocoa for example), the result is very nice!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"This stuff is a GREAT snack. I ordered 2 cases & had them sent to the office. Everybody loved this stuff and one case was gone in about 15 minutes. It tasted really good, says it is healthy and with the 50% off offer from Amazon it was a great deal. You've have to be crazy to pay the ""retail"" price of $45.00 for a case of 12 of these and even the regular Amazon price which would be almost $3.00 for each 3.5 oz box of popcorn is way to much but the stuff is really good. 3 more cases on the way to the office - 2 sent for gifts.It is a great treat but awfully expensive w/o the Amazon discounts."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I'm celiac and raw vegan. One taste of these delightful crackers and I was hooked, enough so that I bent the rules of my raw vegan diet to allow for Mary's Gone. Even if I were not celiac, I'd have my pantry stocked with these crackers. I live in hurricane country so I want my pantry stocked well with nutritious food in case of emergency. Mary's sure are nutritious, delicious and way more convenient than dehydrating my own raw crackers which I'm not always up for preparing. Bravo, Mary!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"Okay I don't eat organic, I eat meat and I've never hugged a tree. That being said, I would have never tried any Liddell spray products if a friend hadn't uttered the words ""raise your tounge"" one day when I was coughing. It was the Asthma spary and a few minutes later I was breathing clearly. I bought several Liddell products and have been very happy with all of them. My husband has bad allergies and bronchitis and these sprays really control his symptoms. Maybe there's something to this holistic stuff afterall. Thanks Liddell & thanks Amazon for a great price."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,5.0,While I wouldn't call this a health food they are healthier than most snack foods so I don't worry as much when my kids eat a bag of these.The taste is a bit more mild than Cheetos so if you are hooked on cheetos these might not do. I know when we open a bag around here no one can stop eating them until they are gone.Here are the nutrition facts comparing them to Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Cheese PuffsCheetos WC Smart PuffCalories 150 130Fat Calories 80 60Fat 9g 6gSodium 290mg 50mgNot a huge difference and everything else is close. I'm sure regular cheetos would have higher numbers.
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,unknown,3.0,"At the recommended four teaspoons per serving I think this would be pretty overwhelming. I use about two and get a chalky aftertaste, but not all that bad. I actually prefer International Delight Cinnamon Hazelnut, but that is a refrigerated item and obviously can't be shipped easily. You're buying a lot of creamer here and this deal may be better for an office than a single person home... but it will keep and will add variety to my coffee drinking."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I bought these bottles due to wanting a BPA-free bottle and they were good. I ended up growing out of them too fast (she was eating more then 5 ounces) however these are great for newborns, since they come with the newborn slow flow nipples, and I definitely liked how the bottle came apart for extremely easy cleaning!!! Definitely worth a shot!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This finely ground flaxseed is easy to sprinkle into any dish you are cooking and adds great nutritional value. It's affordable in comparison to other products I've looked at. Best of all, the taste is negligible - I don't notice much of a flavor difference when added to various dishes."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,I wish this wasn't as expensive but I have to admit its well made and looks great. Minus one star for value.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"It mixes much better than other gainers, tastes good and best of all it works. I have gained weight on it. Shipping was fast too.Thanks"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I like this product, I tried the generic and it didnt work as good as the original."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Whenever we go up the road to Disney World my daughter and I have lunch in Japantown and we always get their curry dish. One day she asked if we could make it at home. I was skeptical but found this curry sauce mix at the store and decided to give it a try. We were both delighted at the outcome - identical, or very near it, with the curry sauce we get in Japantown. Yummy stuff!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I received the merchandise in a timely manner; item is exactly as illustrated in the picture and is a mix of both style and convenience. The Bebe au Lait covers are available in many colors/patterns and are not too heavy.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,4.0,"I was kinda hope that they come with a 6-ouce can. My son can only take 6oz at a time so everytime I have to bring another container to store the rest of it. Other than that, perfect product. My son loves it and no rashes after we switch to this formula."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"They may be slightly dry, but they lack the extra crap that make them a lot less healthy. Newman does a good job with all their foods. Keep up the good work!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,I'm sorry I purchased 6 cannisters of this awful product because I cannot use it.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,Originally we had gotten a rocking ottoman to match our glider... however it took up way too much room in the nursery and it was too high to put my feet on. This nursing stool is the perfect height and takes up next to no room.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"I received a popcorn machine for my birthday and I have not been able to find the right combination to make popcorn that tastes like you get at the movies. The local convienence store always has great popcorn and I happened to notice they use this. I just went through a case in less than a month! It is good stuff! The 8 oz size is a bit much for my family of four, so I will go with the 6 oz this time. I ordered two cases this time!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,The batter whips up alright but for some reason the pancakes are a little on the rubbery side- they were cooked per pkg directions.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,3.0,"This is an okay curry sauce, very basic indeed. I did not taste anything outstanding, and little coconut flavor. I much prefer the Shere Khan korma, it has a bolder flavor. But if your seeking a tame flovor this would a good choice too."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"Annie's Peace Pasta is a delicious meal. Unlike the ""Kraft in a Blue Box"",it's made with all-natural ingredients. It's unique with its Parmesan flavor instead of the usual Cheddar. In a sense, it's like a vegetarian Carbonara (made without the bacon&parsley) or an Alfredo. The rainbow tie-dye packaging is gloriously psychedelic. Annie's Peace Pasta is perfect for lunch and dinner. It's filling. You can add veggies for color (it is pallid on the plate) It's feel-good food!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"Less than ten minutes after swallowing a piece of the mysterious Odwalla bar, I was covered in a red rash, my ears burned, and I felt a tingle over my whole body. Even if I did not have the reaction this bar still tastes terrible (imagine horse grain and dirt). Do not buy OR try."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Run this massager over your arms, hands, legs, feet, neck or back. Its soooo relaxing. Makes me fall asleep. Great product for relieving tension."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FINE PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS NOW.........THEY MOST DEFFINETLY BOOST YOUR ENERGY LEVELS........AS WELL AS KEEP YOUR BODY AT PEAK PERFORMANCE.......YOU ONLY NEED I PACKET OF VITES A DAY.........THE TIMES I EITHER RAN OUT OR FORGOT TO TAKE MY VITES.......I FELT A DIFFERENCE IN MY ENERGY LEVELS......TO ALL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WANT A BETTER BODY......I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS FINE PRODUCT......I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS......I'M 62 AND WORK OUT WITH 45 LB DUMB BELLS 3-4 TIMES A WEEK AS WELL AS 160 BAR BELLS WITH EASEI'M SURE THESE FINE VITES HAVE HELPED ME STAY STRONG AND HAVE A V SHAPED BODY ALL THESE YEARS......
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"This could be the best invention for fast acting allergy relief I've ever used. I have terrible seasonal allergies and took medications almost daily but it took at least an hour to get any relief. With this little pot I get relief in as little as five minutes. This thing rocks, a little gross at times, but still rocks. I've been telling everyone about it that complain about their allergies."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,4.0,"At first you may these taste a little strange - but you'll soon realize that they taste REAL, not preserved. They're delicious and you should try to keep them somewhere that you won't raid for your own dessert so you can actually feed them to your toddler!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,1.0,I ordered this for my mom and she said it didn't do anything like Dramamine. So you get more tablets of lesser to zero nausea stopping power.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Rich, smooth taste with a surprisingly nice overlay of coconut and essence of macadamia. I would definitely buy this again."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Infant and Gas....my baby had a lot of gas. I breastfeed and this seemed to help....
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,This is an outstanding product - would recommend to anyone who likes jerky products - just like eating a piece of steak.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"Given that it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name ""breakfast tea"" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word ""English"" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,These are really tasty! The cracker is crunchy with a hint of buttery flavor. The cheese filling is creamy and good. The only flaw is that the package seems to be empty way too fast! My 7-year-old daughter loves these and is always asking for them.
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"My physical therapist recommended I wear some sort of toe separator at night to help with my bunion pains. While I have not been able to keep them on all night (it takes some time getting used to wearing them without them hurting - as per instructions), the time I have worn them has really made a difference. My only criticism is the material they are made of - it's a rigid foam that is slightly abrasive."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"These are probably some of the best patches I have used! They stick great, and keep sticking even after multiple uses! They do cost a little more than some out there, but worth the extra expense!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This product is absolutely wonderful. I bought this warmer after being given the larger one with the cooler as a baby shower gift. I wanted to use this one for travel and to send with to our childcare provider's house. This warmer quickly heats up a bottle even in the care using an adapter. You do have to play with the amount of water added to the warmer, but not much. The automatic shut-off is a life saver and makes it an ease to use. I am confident warming up my breastmilk in this warmer and I would recommend it to any family with a new baby."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,3.0,product was excellent.....medium was smaller size groat than expected...will order next larger size next time
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,1.0,"Stale--really stale. It was so tough, it could no longer qualify as ""crisp"" bread. Since this was totally unexpected, the shipping box and label was thrown away so there was no way to return it to Amazon."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"Incredibly tasty, incredibly spicy, just the way I like it! It does have the flavor of seafood but it's fairly mild. If you absolutely do not like the flavor of fish, this may be something to avoid. Try the kimchi flavor instead.Incredibly salty, one pack is supposed to provide 2 servings but let's be serious - maybe for kids, but I garnish mine with vegetables and it's a full meal. 480 cal per pack at just over TWO grams of salt (that's 2080 mg). For me that's over twice the amount of salt I normally intake daily. But it really works with this soup. I wouldn't eat it everyday unless I was going to sweat it off/out. Noodles are very good in consistency, hearty and slightly chewy without being tough. Don't overcook the noodles, they get soggy/mushy in the worst way and are absolutely (IMHO) unpalatable."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We use the Sassy MAM bottles. I researched each brand of bottles and found that these were the best for us for many reasons. First, my daughter is breastfed and the breast-like nipple made it easy (as in no problems whatsoever) to transfer from the breast to the bottle and back. It made my transition to work much easier. Second, they do not contain BPA. If you have the choice to use bottles with BPA or BPA free, why not choose BPA free just to be safe? Third, they are reasonably priced in my opinion. The bottles have not warped or show any signs of usage. Moreover, each piece comes apart to ensure that you can get the bottle clean.I definately recommend these bottles! The only con I can think of is that they are hard to find. I need to get new nipples for the bottles and cannot find them."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I have been using Tens Patches for almost 5 years now, and these are the worst patches I have ever used!!! They do not stick, nor do they seem to transfer the electical pulse properly? Do NOT waste your hard earned money on these!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,These snacks are surprisingly tasety! They taste like the Mike Sells puff corn with a cheeto's crunchy shape and texture. My pickey child even likes them!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"-- better yet, 96 pods of caffeine bliss. This variety is great. All I've tried so far were full-flavored and not bitter at all. I have an old Starbuck's Barista expresso-maker that these work well in. Like a previous reviewer, I had only tried the Illy pods before -- okay, but not great.If you love variety and great-flavored espresso/cappuccinos, you will want to try these."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I have literally tried all sippy cups out there. These ones are the best. I don't know why some reviewers say they leak. I have 6 of these and not one has a problem. Maybe the rubber straw is not put in properly. If you pull it out, you have to push it back in until it ""locks"". Also, if you do remove the handles from the cup, it's not hard to put it back together at all!!! I do it all the time when I wash them.My son throws them across the room as hard as he can (he's 18 months old) and not one came apart or broke. They're extremely sturdy.They're absolutely the best cups out there. I also purchased the larger type, without the handles and those are also awesome."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,3.0,"Although these have great flavor - hint of vanilla & lemon, they are really not suited for wine tasting since a cracker should cleanse the palate. Probably too sweet. We've had mixed comments."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,We bought this because we had such great results with the Thumper massager. We already had the Sharper Image foot massager but this one is WAY better. A deeper massage over a greater foot area. Very nice indeed.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"These bottles are great. I purchased them because they are BPA free. I have also used Medela, Advent, and Dr. Browns. The Born Free are by far the best. The wide neck makes adding formula easy. I haven't had any problems with leaking or a collapsed nipple as other posts mention. In fact, I am able to shake them to mix the formula w/o any spilling which I have found is impossible with the Dr. Brown bottles. My son seems to prefer the nipple shape of the Born free to the other brands as well and is less gassy than when we use the Medela or Advent. I am very satisfied. The only downside is currently the company is out of stock on their venting system so you only get one venting system per three pack of bottles and have to redeem a free coupon to get the other two vents. I had a bunch from the smaller 5 oz bottles I bought so I was able to use those with the new 9 oz bottles I purchased until I get the new ones. I highly recommend these bottles."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I haven't used the ointment yet, but will need it the next time I curl my hair. It never fails that I burn my ear, neck or side of my face with the curling iron. My brother told me about Foille. He swears by it, and I trust his word."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"This product helped me to sleep. I was stressed and anxious and I slept like a baby after taking Amoryn. There was no ""hangover"" the next morning either!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,"This product worked well by keeping your feet really moisturized. Will most likely work wonders if you have a pedicure done first and then used this product. Also, sometimes the product will continue to foam when not in use (maybe because of climate??). If you have really bad feet according to the video on [...], you will need to get more than 1 can."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,4.0,"Liked this trail mix very much, though would have liked it spicier. The salty mix of nuts, sesame sticks, corn nuts and other stuff is quite satisfying - though it usually takes the whole bag to get it done."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Only a 1/4 of the impact to the blood sugar as honey. I use it to make margarita's sweeter. Es muy bien
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,I have fallen in love with these chips. They taste great and I can eat a handful for less than 100 calories. A great little treat to have in my desk at work and on the counter at home. Try them they're great!!!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Came across this coffee in a hotel in Kazakhstan during a business visit. Really enjoyed it ,but it is not available in Australia to the consumer. Found it on Amazon, and now have it every morning.If you like coffee with real ""guts"" and a bit of flavour but none of that bitterness, this is the one."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"1) Although I should have looked at the written size in the disruption better I thought I was getting the larger canister of cream, I did not, the canister being sold is NOT pictured, it is half the size.2) If you are going to USPO I wise companies would learn to use the US Post Office better, they have a something called a ""FLAT RATE BOX"" (free of charge and in two sizes) in to sizes costing to send anywhere in the US including Hawaii for about $9.00, not the $25.00 box i was charged. the items I got fit into the box even the item I thought I was getting fixes into the box.I will not be using this vender again.The product is very good i always use it on my clients"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,This massager makes your scalp feel great... Feels like someone washing you hair... that kind of tingling... I definitely recommend this.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This unit is a must have for people that are on their feet all day long.Works better than advertised and is built like a tank. I highly recommend this product and use it on a daily basis.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,This booster seat is great. its portable and we have taken it on travel and to grandmas. Its easy to get the tray on and off as well.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,These have the exact same ingredients as the very expensive SuperMom vitamins. Excellent all purpose vitamin.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"These nipples do have a large X shaped hole at the end. I see that one reviewer disputes this, but that must have been an older version. My son will not use these, so this was was a wasted purchase. He uses the Avent and Gerber nipples just fine.I purchased these in order to use the non-bpa glass bottles. Maybe the medium sized nipples would work, but I'm not willing to take that chance..."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,4.0,"I enjoyed Stevia, especially the flavored Stick Packs. I use it in my water bottles and in tea for added flavor and sweetness. I also use the individual packs as they are easy to carry for traveling. This is one product that does not contain aspartame as is Splenda and Equal. This product is my choice of artificial sweetners."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I grew up in the midwest drinking this stuff. Glad, I can finally get it again, now that I live in Florida."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,Really like Nutty Rice. The crunchy texture remains even after I add the milk. The ingredients are minimal and fit into my diet since I have numerous food allergies. One of the few cereals I can eat since it is wheat free. I add a small amount of agave nectar for little extra sweetness. Ate this morning with fresh peaches and was delicious.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I am not a fan of green tea or any tea for that matter, but I grew to love this."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,I like the taste and crispiness of the Snapeas but I find it very salty. I hope that they reduce the sodium content.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"If you haven't tried Tawari Honey, you should. Made from a flower found only on New Zealand's North Island, it's the best tasting honey my wife and I have ever had."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,Not at all what I hoped it would be. Missing lots of flavor.I had purchased Act ll Corn on the Cob and had hoped this would be as good.It's just popcorn. Could have saved myself some money. I gave most of the boxes away. Still looking for the Act ll brand.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love this stuff, gives me great energy, and I love the taste -- fruity and tangy. I can't believe the people who say it tastes bad. I can only think they haven't done much health food in their time. Try brewer's yeast some time, then tell me this stuff tastes bad."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"My daughter and son-in-law, who are very busy, love Classic Suddenly Salad. They like tasty pasta dishes, and they keep an assortment of Suddenly Salads on hand. When they have time they make wonderful pasta salad from scratch, but they need some dishes that are tasty and quick.They use olive oil. They like to add some carrots for crunch, some ham, and some cubes of cheese. The stir-ins suggested on the box sound great"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This really must be good for you, because it is really awful tasting. The instructions call for a banana and half an apple (Fuji I believe), which enables one to drink it without gagging. I'm just cheap enough that I was determined to consume the entire amount purchased because it's so expensive. I am truly thankful that I bought the small size."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I originally purchased these bottles purely because they are BPA free, but they have so much more to offer. I had been using Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles in the past and I was a bit skeptical when I decided to switch to a BPA free bottle; was I surprised! I have not had any problems with leaks and the anti-colic system is working great for my three month old who has had HORRIBLE colic in the past. They are also easy to hold and it doesn't take but a second to assemble (even when I have to make a bottle one handed!) I highly recommend these to anyone."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,5.0,I absolutely love poptarts and I buy the lowfat version so I save about half the fat of the regular version. I think they taste better than the regular version when toasted. They come out crispier and with a better flavor. The price is right at amazon.com
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,By far the best nursing cover. Easy to put on and you can see your baby. The Mayfair pattern is very stylish too. A must for nursing moms!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have tried a lot of energy bars and I have to say, Balance cookie dough is the best I have ever tasted. (I'm not saying all the Balance flavors are as good as this one- I have tried and not liked other Balance bars.) But the cookie dough flavored one is awsome. It is covered in chocolate so it's like eating a chocolate bar, except with a lot more nutritional content! Try this bar if you really want a great tasting energy bar."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,3.0,"Taste is fine. However, if you follow directions exactly it tends to be a bit watery with less cheese than expected. We add a half cup of shredded cheddar to get consistency we want."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This product is a must have. I must admit there were several items I received at my baby shower that I do not and will not ever use. But this item is used EVERY DAY! And I could not live without it. My mother-in-law washes the bottles (when she is babysitting) and I always have to re-wash them when she returns them to me because she dries them on a towel and they always have water stains! When I wash and dry the bottles, nipples, rings and pacifiers I never have one water mark on them. The way this rack is designed is perfect for bottles, nipples etc. And I haven't had a single problem with it. The only thing I would recommend (especially since we are on well water) is to take it apart about every two - four weeks to wipe it down and disinfect it. Just my personal choice I guess. Thank you for this product. It gets an A+++ from me! :)P.S. I am now purchasing another drying rack for my mother-in-law for when I go back to work and she is babysitting full time. :)"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"It's true. This thing is a piece of junk. I've had it for a while now and have not used it much. My husband thought I was over-reacting when I insisted that our 21 month old felt hotter than what this digital read out was giving us. The home readout, taken 20 minutes before going to the doctor, registered 3 degrees lower than actual (home reading said 100, doctor said 103). I even took it two times in both ears to make sure I was getting a clear reading. That is distressing. The only benefit of this, of course, is that it's nice to have proof for hubby that I know what the heck I'm talking about when it comes to hyper-vigilant health care for our kids!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I like a deep roasted aromatic coffee that can stand up to a huge slosh of half and half. This one can. I'll buy again.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Lipton makes a quality tea. It doesn't have the ""fancy name"" or upscale packaging as other teas, but it also doesn't have the upscale price. Good tea and a good value, especially when you can take advantage of the bonus coupon Amazon offers now and again.I've found Lipton excells as an iced tea, especially when you sun brew it (just fill a large glass jar with water, add a few bags, cover it, and set it in the sun for a few hours). Very mellow, full-body taste. Goes great with a touch of lemon or mint."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,These chips are wonderfull. I've ordered three flavors so far
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,Love this travel chair! securely fastens on tables and counters. folds flat which is awesome for travel and cleans up easily.only wish is that there was some way to keep the mess a little more contained like a traditional highchair does.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"My favorite of the traditional Earl Grey teas is Bigelow. Personally, I find Twinings too light and a bit sour. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,An excellent deal and a wonderful product. I have a lot of fragrance allergies and this didn't bother me at all and STILL it smells GREAT!!! Thank you!!!!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"My mom used sugar twin to make iced tea and I do the same for my own family. Suddenly, it is impossible to find in any store in my area. I was very worried, as I have tried other products and nothing tastes like Sugar Twin. I am so glad to see that I can order it online. To the manufacturer"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,1.0,"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG. Those who are sensitive beware. Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,3.0,"as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad. seems like nothing is really ""good"" so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"From the time that I was a child, beans in different forms have been part of almost every meal. With more and more hectic schedules and less time to focus on cooking, it has been difficult to prepare beans - especially refried beans - as often as I would like. Enter Santa Fe Bean Co.'s product"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I really like this product. I mix it with 5 frozen strawberries; plain yogurt and skim milk for a nice breakfast shake and put it in my magic bullet. I am not a breakfast eater and this fills me right up till lunch. I only like the vanilla. I don't care for the taste of the French vanilla. I used to buy this product at Wal-mart and Kinney Drugs, but neither place carries it anymore. I was very happy to find this on Amazon."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,My daughter is two months old and I have been both breast and bottle feeding her since day one. I have tried every kind of bottle i could get my hands on and I could not get her to conform to any of them. I came across these bottles and thought they looked ugly and bulky. These are the only bottles she'll tolerate and I love them. They will leak if not tightened but it's not a problem after you get the hang of it. I would definately recommend them.
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,Awesome new flavor! It is one of the best Luna's I have had. I highly recommend it to others who love Lunas!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"By now I've tried both the chocolate and fuzzy navel flavors (my first review commented on vanilla only). Both chocolate and fuzzy navel taste outstanding! Highly recommended along with vanilla! I now keep all three available to supplement my daily meals (vanilla, chocolate, and fuzzy navel). I've been using the vanilla and chocolate much longer than fuzzy navel, but so far the fuzzy navel flavor is nearly addictive to my tastes (my craving for it may eventually pass, but so far I like it as well if not better than chocolate or vanilla). The fuzzy navel flavor tastes close to vanilla with a very light touch of peach and orange added. In a way the flavor reminds me of the ""lemon"" ice cream or frozen custard I ate as a kid; it really didn't taste like lemon at all, but was more interesting and tastier than vanilla. The fuzzy navel flavor is so subtle you could probably use it in frozen fruit smoothies instead of vanilla (I haven't tried this yet) and not notice much of a difference (and this would allow you to reduce your inventory from three flavors to two flavors by dropping the vanilla).I am on my 3rd 5 lb container of vanilla, 2nd chocolate and 1st fuzzy navel. I often pack a lean lunch (including a small amount of animal protein, fruit and vegetable) and premix four servings of ISO*100 to take with me when I go off to work for the day (following something similar to BFL, eating a meal every two hours or so) and all flavors keep well throughout the day when premixed (or even keep well overnight). I still prefer to mix on the fly when I am going to be around the house (see my previous vanilla review for how to chill your water with ice without blending any foam into your delicious meal replacement). When I start weight training again I will add two additional daily servings of ISO*100 (to bring daily protein intake up to one gram of protein per pound of body weight when including my two regular meals).It does not matter whether the IOS*100 you buy has a white or black plastic container, or whether what you buy is labeled as a ""gourmet"" flavor or not. Don't pay more; if you hunt online price you should be able to find 5 lb quantities for somewhere around $60 or less. As far as I can tell, Dymatize has replaced their old blends with new blends labeled ""Gourmet"" and part of that upgrade involves changing the container color from white to black. The last time I ordered online, the picture of what I ordered showed a white container and did not include the word Gourmet on the flavor label; what I received in the mail was the black container with the Gourmet labeling. My first two containers of vanilla were the old recipe in the white containers; and compared to the newer gourmet black container this older style vanilla was slightly ""grainy"" when thoroughly mixed compared to the newer ISO*100 products from Dymatize (my chocolate and fuzzy navel were ever grainy but these have always been in black containers).Regarding Dymatize's use of Sucralose; although you can find some limited negative press on this particular artificial sweetener, it is one of the most recently developed zero-carb sweeteners and considered by most authorities to be much healthier than earlier popular artificial sweeteners. If anything better comes along in terms of ""health"" and ""taste"" I'm sure Dymatize will be quick to pick it up. In the meantime, having a pure high protein low carb drink is a great convenience. I still have not found a better or comparable product. Thank You Dymatize and all the retailers selling this at affordable prices."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I was looking for BPA free bottles which were not as expensive as the born free and could easily work between breast feeding and bottlefeeding. This bottle is a winner! Not only was my baby able to transition with ease, he has little to no gas. My friend's had recommended Dr.Brown's (at the time were not BPA free), but mentioned that they were a pain to clean. With a full time job and a house to manage, these bottles are a breeze to clean. I have had no problems with boiling any parts of the bottle. I did have a tiny hole in three of the bottles ultivent valves, but I called Sassy and they sent me replacements part ASAP and for free!!! And the easy clearly marked nipples and made transitioning easy between slow flow and medium flow nipples."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,We have been stocking the essn Mineola Tangerine. This is even better. This will be the flavor of choice for now.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have read many places that STASH has the highest amounts of antioxidants found in green tea. It is a little pricier than some other brands, but the taste is good, so it is worth it."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"this is soooo satisying when I am craving something with a nicechewy, meaty texture. I've tried a lot of the different naturalcan chili's and mixes and this is my all-time favorite. It hasbecome a regular part of my diet."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,These are great for quick clean-of of your breast pump and accessories. I'm a working mom so it's nice and convienient when you're pumping at work and my not have the facilities to clean your pump the way you should. It doesn't replace a good cleaning though. But definite must for the mom on the go!
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I bought 2 of these and I love them. They are absolutley great and sure saves time on having to wash the sheets and mattress pad over and over again. When there is an accident, it does not leak through the pad, it is soaked up! The only con, which is not that big of deal, is that they do move but because I got the bigger ones there is rarely an accident that gets on the sheets. I was going to get the ones that tucked it, but I thought that would be just as annoying as have to change the sheets because you had to tuck them in on both sides and when the bed is against the wall, it makes it more difficult. I would 100% recommend this sheet protector."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,3.0,"This does seem to take the edge off of my cravings and I do have more energy. But, I can't take 2 at a time without getting jittery and queasy ---it feels like taking ibuprofen on an empty stomach. I have tried taking them an hour apart, but no difference. I have been taking them for 3 weeks, exercising, watching what I eat and I haven't lost a pound. I will continue taking them 1 at a time just for the effect of curbing my binging urges."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I really love these snacks. They are low in calories and fat while being high in protein, which is important to me because I am a vegetarian."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This has been my son's favorite snack to take for break time at his 3 hour gymnastics classes. It's easy to grab to go, pack, and keep handy in the car."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is my favourite recent discovery! A friend recommended this product & I have been using it for about a year & a half now and I would hate to be without it.I apply the cream under my arms every 6-9 days and the smell goes away! (I sometimes forget to re-apply periodically and I am reminded by a bad smell that is there even after bathing). I really appreciate that my body is allowed to eliminate toxins through sweat as nature intended but without the smell!I find most traditional antiperspirants with aluminum derivatives in them make my fingers tingle after application (That can't be good for me).I am very pleased with this product and I find it works well! I like to buy the Larger Size because I find it to be a better value! Lavilin Underarm Deodorant Cream - Large Size, NOW FoodsI typically get 6-9 days out of each application.BRAVO Lavilin! Keep up the good work! Thanks for creating & selling a product that helps me stay healthy & smell good at the same time!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"I ordered this. This still has some moisture left . I am from India and I know Ghee. this should be more granular in consistency not like a paste. Good Indian products are either sold in India or England, not in USA. Urmil"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,These are great. Each package contains a whole bunch of dolphins. Way cheaper than the individually packaged goldfish.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This chair may not have all the bells and whisles some of the more expensive massage chairs may have but it gives a great massage!I love the fact that this chair is light in weight.(I was able to slide it out of the box and position it in my room in the location I wanted.) This chair also has a Stretch setting that not all other chairs have which is wonderful after a hard day of work. The chair swivels to the left and right making it more flexible for use as a regular chair while having a conversation.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Shopping for Bioprene on Amazon was so easy since it can't be found locally and I received it quickly with just standard shipping.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"These foot pads are a scam. The pads contain vinegar, so when you open them and when the air comes in contact with the vigegar, the pads turn brown. So it looks like toxins are coming out of your body when it is actually the vinegar in the pads coming in contact with the air. And it is impossible for toxins to flow out of your foot (the skin is too thick)"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We received these booster chairs as gifts (we have twins) and used them instead of highchairs in our home. Before the babies were old enough to sit up, we were shown by an occupational therapist how to prop them up with blankets to sit in these chairs. When we went on trips we just took them with us - all the way cross-country once! It helped the children feel more comfortable and helped them focus on eating. We strapped them to chairs everywhere and even used them to keep the kids in place for picnic eating at a reststop. In situations like this we could just snap the lid on a dirty tray and deal with cleanup at our destination.My twins are 3.5 now and we keep one available strapped to a chair for time outs and for when my son wants a booster at the table. They've been invaluable, both with the tray and and as a booster chair at the table.Another nice thing is that when my kids got to sit in high chairs, it was a treat for them and they were more likely to behave and be willing to sit in high chairs at restaurants or my mother's house."
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,5.0,"I love this pacifier! I bought the red dog, too (I think that is cuter). Unfortunately I did it before my baby was born and I see now that she is not into pacifier that much (which is not bad either). She uses it occasionally before sleeping."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"My wife wanted these because they're supposed to be the safest. They're also expensive. The twin pack I saw in the store came with two vents (one for each bottle) but curiously the 3-pack came with only 1 vent. But you can't use the bottle without the vent. The vent sticks up a quarter inch above the rim of the bottle, so if you screw the nipple on without the vent it will leak.We were used to the Evenflo nipples with the integrated ""vent"" (two air-holes) so I forgot that if you took the BornFree vent out that it would also create a vacuum inside the bottle when baby sucks.Pros"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"It came in a couple of days, way faster than what I paid for. The packaging is good, spoon is included (you may have to dig a bit for it, but it's there.)I gained 23 pounds in 3 months using this product together with their creatine. Highly recommended. The taste is, well, alright. It's not tasty or anything, but hey, it's protein powder.Buy the ""Ultimate Shaker Bottle"" if you're looking for a good shaker, only 4$ and will last you a long time."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,5.0,product is dynamite well worth the price as far back as i can remember tastes like the original ive tried too many other brands all a waste of money
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I found these about 6 years ago and have loved them ever since. They have the chewy of the original, with the spicy taste of ginger and the nuttiness of the peanut. Wonderful. I love the spiced apple as well, but over all these are my favorite."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,1.0,"while this is the best soda ever made, this is WAAAAY too much for one 2-liter when on faygos site you can get 8 for almost the same price"
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"I find these lancets to be much less painful than any other available. A lower number in the lancing device is enough to provide adequate blood sample. A little harder to find, but worth the search."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,My husband just loves the stuff. Sweet with just a nice bit of zest. My husband likes it on english muffins and toast. Great to be used as glazes on meats too.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Acidophilus makes yogurt a bit more tart than starter without it. This starter makes a nice creamy yogurt that's not too tart. It's the only starter I use now. I make yogurt several times a week.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I eat these bars almost daily. They taste great, and I don't notice the odor that another reviewer mentions. My husband is a bit of a picky eater who doesn't avoid sugar or make an effort to get plenty of veggies like I do. He really likes them too. They're great as an energy bar during or after a long workout, as a snack or part of a lunch. 160 calories isn't bad. And I love that they taste great and help me get my daily veggie servings. Finally, they don't mess up my blood sugar like the date-based bars tend to do."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,I ordered 2 12-box cartons of this cereal because my family loves it and all the boxes in BOTH cartons were stale. We were extremely disappointed. Would not recommend ordering it from Amazon. Go to the grocery store and buy a box at a time to ensure freshness!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"It's too soon to know if this product will work or not, but I am hopeful! SmartBomb is a great company to order from!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Ordered these walkie talkies for my 3 year old grandson. I was looking for something that would be a lot of fun and yet very durable. These are just that and very reasonably priced and work perfectly.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,"This is by far the best beef snack I have had. I have subscribed to it for three months now, and still love its taste as much as three months ago. Recommended for anyone who loves beef jerky and the like."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I wouldn't buy these again unless they go on sale again. I got them really cheap on here like 11.50 for the whole box. So i decided what the hell. I bought three boxes of protein bars because I'm currently dieting and always on the go. I also bought luna sunrise bars which i loved!! And clif mojo bars which was my 2nd fave.These chocolate raspberry bars are ok. The texture is a little weird, it has a fake chocolate taste, and the raspberry taste is pretty light. But I did appreciate that the raspberry's seemed fresh because of the seeds from them in the bars. They are not horrible but if you're looking for good taste and not just a diet bar, I'd go for luna or clif."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,"This is a wonderful alternative to lugging around all the pills I take. Recently, I have been forgetting weather or not I took my morning meds, leading me to double-dose sometimes which - needless to say - was bad. I wanted an alternative to the large box I carry with me everywhere I go, but less clunky then a pill organizer. This was absolutely perfect.The plastic of the pill boxes is quite sturdy but - as I realize it is just *plastic* - I make sure not to put the pods into a situation where they may be crushed easily (like a large purse alongside heavy objects). I have read reviews about the pods breaking, which makes me wonder if those who received the fragile pods had either heat damaged or poorly-molded pods. These seem quite sturdy. The only thing that worries me a little is the plastic tab that holds the lids on each container. Each compartment (separated by a plastic divider) is about 1 1/4"" wide by 1 1/2"" long by 1/2"" deep.The only thing keeping this product from getting five stars is the fact that the AM/PM slots lack independent lids. This can be a problem if handling the pods either half asleep or in a vehicle.I would not recommend this for the elderly. Whereas these work for me fine (I'm in my 20s), I can see why the pods/boxes would be difficult for someone with an uneasy grasp and poor eyesight. Though if you buy this set and find it unsuitable for Grandma, these make fantastic back-up boxes for those who suffer from headaches, indigestion, or remembering to take your meds during allergy season or bouts of the flu."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,5.0,Sometimes its nice to drink water with subtle flavor and no calories. But the best part is no artificial sweetners/chemicals.
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,Sweet is correct .Product is as advertised. Very comfortable and easy to adjust. Keeps all the light out and there is space so do not feel the mask against your eyes. The shipment and packaging was beyond compare.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I was very picky when it came to a foot massage. I knew I wanted a heater and I read every review on here on every model available before choosing this model. I think this model is pretty good for at home use. Of course I would rather have someone also massaging my feet, for it to be deeper so it covered more, and possibly a wider base...but hey, this is a home unit and it is pretty darn good. The heating function is wonderful, getting the water nice and hot. I wish there were air jets under my foot- they are at the top of the unit shooting at my toes. I curl my toes this way and that and it pushes the bubbles around my feet. I think I am going to try putting my sea salts in a cheesecloth and see if it works. Otherwise, you can't add sea salts to the unit...which is a bummer.Overall, this a good unit for at home use."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,1.0,"I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does. It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland). I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better. I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort). I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like, we didn't!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Very nice syrupy taste. Nice consistancy (not like water). Try it, you will like it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I got this for my mom and she has no problems using this product. The only complaint I have is the cost which is quite expensive. I was at Target the other day and saw another brand for a lot less. Think I'll be trying out the other brand and see...
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I am a long distance cycler. I have tried a lot of energy bars and most work very well but taste... well not so much. This bar is softer so it is easier to chew while riding, and it is smooth, so you don't have to suck down your precious water supply just to choke it down. I love both the Pineapple and Berry flavors. Highly recommended."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"My daughter loves fresh strawberries but out of season they get pricey and go bad fast, especially the organic ones. Instead I give her these which she loves. And I enjoy having an organic choice to give her as a snack. Most of the competitors load their fruit flats with corn syrup. Stick with a healthy alternative and your kids will love these. We have tried the fruit rolls too but that tends to end up in a sticky mess. I find this size to be perfect to drop into a lunch box or hand out as a snack."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I tried this fast as a way to investigate a suspected food allergy and to just reset my body.During the fast:I had caffeine headaches for the first 2 days but these went away. Day 2 was the hardest by far - got a little easier after that. My sense of smell increased so that I could smell a neighbor's grill 2 blocks away. Unlike some reviewers, I had a drop in energy. Some tasks took me longer to complete due to lack of focus. I realized how much of eating is either social or due to boredom. While I definitely went through periods of hunger, some of it was due to routine. Didn't experience too many side effects"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I purchased the cappuccinno product and wanted to try it in my Gevalia two cup coffee maker. I set the timer and wake to coffee heaven. This is absolutely one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had.Don't know if you're supposed to do this... but I reused the same pad twice. Coffee was a little weaker but it was still good.Wherever I put my coffee down, I can still smell the aroma of this delightful coffee. I will buy more for sure!!I have tried two other Senso flavored pads and they are quite good too but the cappuccino is my favorite by far!!!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I found Luna bars in my ongoing search for tasty, healthful snacks that would satisfy, have some whole grains (Luna Sunrise), a good balance of carbs and protein and also contain a decent amount of fiber. Kashi bars' odd texture and aftertaste (and a tendency to go stale quickly) had sorely disappointed me. SoyJoy left me hungry. Clif's ZBars were yummy but carb-heavy. Clif's regular bars were tasty but too dense and sugary. When I read the Luna label I was impressed. So far, so good! I *LOVE* Luna's flavors (Chocolate Peppermint, Lemon Zest, Smores) and can't wait to try more!! Luna's makers have discovered the perfect texture; chewy but not gooey with a bit of crisp and no grit. They are sweet enough to satisfy cravings but not overly so. For hours after I munch on a Luna bar, I am not plagued with hunger. My 15 y.o. daughter is now hooked too. Finally...a snack we can enjoy AND feel good about! Will continue to purchase."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I've used Arniflora for years and wouldn't be without it. It helps me with any aches and pains after working out with weights.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,2.0,I bought this salt expecting it to be the large compacted salt granules you get on a soft pretzel. I was sorely disappointed when it arrived and it is the oversized granules of regular rock salt like you find on standard hard pretzels. Make sure that's what your looking for before you buy.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,These are great little bags at a great price. The best feature is that they actaully stand up making it very easy to pour your milk into them and very easy to measure out your milk. I had no issues with them leaking or coming open or anything. The storage system for these bags works with all bags and I have to say its pretty fantastic too.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"This product's shape makes it extremely flexible in its application. I especially like to drape it down the side of my spin. Also great around wrists and elbows. The filling does shift a bit more than I would prefer, but this can be managed through familiarity with use. This, as all the Bed Buddy products I have used, is a great investment and value for the dollar."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola trail mix bars,5.0,These are the best tasting granola bars around! My daughter and I have celiac and this is one of the few bars without wheat or malt flavoring. Great taste and only 150 calories. Bonus
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"After applying it for 2 weeks,my eye area looks the same.It does not do anything for the lines at all."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is the best vegie mix I have ever bought.It adds so much flavor to my soups.Every item I bought from this seller has been very fresh.I just bought 6 more jars of the vegie mix to keep on hand. I even boil it with spaghetti, My son loves it that way. I am going to give a few away to friends, so they can share in my findings."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I really like the Splenda packets. For the past 6 years or so, I've been using about 10 packets a day to sweeten my black tea. I've never liked Equal or Sweet 'n' Low, so Splenda is the only ""no calorie"" sweetener I use.Interesting to note, one day I ran out of packets, and to substitute, I tried using the Splenda granular that's intended for baking. No such luck. I was pouring the stuff into my tea mug, and it still didn't seem sweet. Huh. So, I've stuck with the packets. (I never did end up baking anything with the boxed Splenda.)"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I feel terrible when my sinuses act up, and this product is the only one I have benefitted from this much. Anyone suffering from puffy eyes and cheeks resulting from sinus pressure will likely benefit from this product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"Just make a small cut in the top of the pouch, microwave and you have dinner! The only thing I can think of to improve upon this is to maybe add some meat. It's a little spicy for me, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods. It wasn't so spicy that it kept me from finishing it off! I have celiac, so it was a treat to have something this easy to prepare that also tasted great. My husband tried some, not knowing it was gluten-free and asked me to please buy some more!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"love this product, it sure helped me with my hot flashes and it is well worth the price."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"Long lasting, comfortable and absorbent.Skin remains dry and odor free.Highly recommended above all other pads."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,I liked this product I used it for about two months and noticed that I lost weight. I will be buying more of it.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This was my first massager so I don't have much to compare it to. I bought it mostly for scalp massages for which I think it works fine. I tried it on a few sore muscles and it worked pretty well. My only gripe is that there are only two settings. I think it would be better if there were a medium setting instead of just a ""low"" and ""high"""
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Great product. Very moist and flavorful. Purchased mine at my local Target store for .97 cents a box. Well worth the price.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I had to take it for several months before it started working consistently, but now I am very pleased with its effectiveness."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've gotten hooked on Shot Bloks as an energy source for longer bike rides.They are easy to carry, eat, and provide a foolproof way of monitoring calorie consumption. Yes, they're sweet, but they don't give me that sick to my stomach feeling that many of the gels are known for. The texture is a huge improvement over gels as well. Whether you chew it quickly or just hold it in your mouth, eating it is easy.I've tried several of the flavors and settled on Strawberry as the one that works for me."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I had tried this bread mix when I first went GF and didn't care for it, but after becoming so disappointed in other mixes (Gluten-Free Pantry, Bob's Red Mill) I decided to try it again and pay more attention to the directions. This time it came out better, although as noted elsewhere, it is rather sweet, which for me is not quite what I'm used to for a sandwich. However, the flavor is certainly tasty (vs. the bland, cardboard taste of GF Pantry), but it's much denser, and doesn't make as big a loaf. I only make it in a bread machine, and the directions have you use the regular cycle rather than the GF one, which is what I had not done before. It takes much longer, but I was pleased with it, and will buy it again. I think perhaps adding herbs might cut the sweetness, although maybe it will clash - I'll find out!Debbie"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,"These are the best chips I have ever eaten. Everyone in our family loves them. Sweet but spicy- crispy....really good. Delivery was perfect, no crushed chips. Fantastic overall."
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,This medicine works wonders. I give it to my son everytime he is teething and the pain just vanishes.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"This one is not for me. The fragrance is the first thing I noticed with this tea. I thought maybe it was just my nose, I was having a sinus issue when I first tried the tea. But, no, it was my tastebuds as well. This tea smells and tastes like butterscotch, which is not for me. I couldn't even pawn it off on any friends or relatives. So, unfortunately it went into the trash. While others may like it, this one just isn't for me. Although, I will say this is the only tea I have tried thus far from Good Earth that I didn't care for. As a whole Good Earth teas are my fave, I buy the Decaf Green Tea with Lemongrass by the case."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"It takes a lot of strength to close the zip. Sometimes you think it is closed but it is NOT! And when you try to store the breast milk, it leaks! It happened to me a few times already!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This diffuser was in a vacation home that we stayed in and I had to get it for our home. I now feel as if I am still on vacation whenever I smell it!! I love it!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Best PowerBar made. For bulk purchases, the price and shipping felt high ($1.75 per bar).Very timely delivery, though."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I'm 36, miscarried 6 months ago. After the miscarriage, I couldn't make sense of my BBTs anymore. I bought the monitor after reading, literally, every review out there. I was skeptical, seemed like a lot of money to invest, but being 36 I didn't really have much time to play around. Somewhat unexpectedly, I used the monitor for 2 months and today found out I am pregnant! It worked as described, telling me when fertility was high and then when ovulation was expected. Pretty incredible. If you are even considering it, buy the monitor - it's worth it to know everything is happening as it should (and of course when you are most fertile)."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"This pasta is so good. I have served it several times to non-GF guests and no one can tell that it's gluten free. Do keep in mind though that it is only 12 oz (the non-organic comes in a 16 oz bag). For my family of four (2 being small children), one bag is barely enough to feed us all."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,It's multi colored rainbow pepper - quality was good and mix was appropriate (not too many black peppercorns).
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I love this chair. I've been putting my son in it since he was 3 months old. It supported him so nicely then so that he could ""join"" the family for dinner and leave my hands free.I love the independent recline on the seat and tray...I have the tray reclined a bit more than the seat so that the toys that he plays with roll toward him instead of away.I also love the one-handed tray release. This seat is very easy to clean, adjust, and install. Two buckle straps and it's on.Attractive and comfortable. Wouldn't buy anything else even if I had the space for a full sized high chair."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have used a couple of heating pads in the past and they either fall apart or don't get hot enough or feel very cheap. I have a friend who recommended this one and I took a flier and gave it a try. While only using it a couple of times, I can tell already that it is going to be different! It gets warmer, has a nice heavy feeling to it and I really like the way it draws the moisture out of the air (like magic!) and just feels ""right"" - I am now fighting my wife half the time to use it - will have to get her her own! I think I got a winner!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"Incredible! Worth every penny and then more. I've had Bernaise in fine restaurants in Montreal, Chicago, San Francisco and this is in their league.Swoony on grilled tenderloins. And you only need a dollop so it's really quite inexpensive -- usually six servings per $6.50 jar."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,Do not waste your money. The temperature reading is erratic and inaccurate. Just does not work as it claims.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I'm a huge fan of origin and varietal coffees, so when I heard that Senseo was coming out with the Kenya Blend, I quickly ordered the product. Compared to the original blends, the Kenya blend has a complex and rich flavor. Senseo always delivers a smooth cup of coffee because it limits the secondary extraction. When Senseo is paired with a great coffee blend, the combination is simply heavenly."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is the healthiest food bar that I know of on the market. All the ingredients are organic, natural, and good for human health. They do not use any junk fillers that may be harmful to human health, like soy protein isolate that you find in most bars with healthy amounts of protein. The great news is that they tast great as well. Enjoy."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,4.0,Tastes great-right amount of crunch and not sickly sweet. Great to just munch as snacks or have it with milk. Plenty of fruits and nuts. Good product! I like it.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I work in the health care field, and when I came across these, I knew I'd be using these pads during potty training! It has sure made it a lot easier then changing sheets every night when my lil one's night diaper doesn't hold through all night! I bought 2 and its great to rotate thoughout the week!! easy to clean...:)and I also put it under the bed sheet to protect mattress now he is potty trained! I got rid of the crazy vinyl mattress sheet under his regular bed sheets :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,2.0,"This product works well by providing a massive caffeine dose via caffeine and caffeine-derived herbs. Half a bottle is usually all it that is needed, which is good because it tastes horrible. Unfortunately the cheap/poor quality of the plastic bottle enables the product to spoil on the shelf, and also makes it difficult to cleanly remove the lid. To make matters worse, the company doesn't answer their phone nor reply to email, therefore if you buy this product online it just becomes more of a headache to deal with. I've found other products with nearly identical ingredients that taste better and cost less."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"My baby likes this toy, particularly the rattle that attaches, but at 7 months she's already too big for it. Her feet touch the floor and she pushes against the floor so there's a risk of her falling backwards (like leaning back in a chair). I stopped using it. We didn't use it as much as I thought we would so I probably would not have bought it had I known."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Want a great replacement for those high calorie desserts? Give this product a try. Nothing about it even would make you think it is sugar-free.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,A friend turned me onto Stubb's Marinade years ago and I simply never cook up any type of steak without marinating it in this potion. Ever! Really brings out the flavor in a cut of beef. Try it one time and you'll be a believer.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Fast, great service, excellent product.Love the one cup serving, and lots of coffee choices. No more wasted coffee."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,I am so happy I found this product. It works well with my mosquito bites.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Found this to make a rich, strong cup of morning coffee! This is one of my favorites along with Newmans."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I bought a batch of this from the health food store because my significant other decided he would go gluten free with me. Mixed up some pancakes for him because he loves them. I ended up eating as much as him!! I would recomment this product to people who are gluten-free or not. They seem to taste good to everyone. :-)
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"I found these sippy cups and they have served us well. When my children were infants we used the Gerber sippy cups which worked well but were really expensive. As my children got older but still not old enough to use a cup without spilling the contents, I switched to these.They last with repeated use for several months then ours eventually develop a crack in them from my boys throwing them on the floor. I do hand wash mine even though they state top-rack dishwasher safe and I believe that helps them last a little longer. They will tend to leak a little if turned upside down and the tops will pop off occasionally. The valve-free design allows for a little leakage but also makes for much easier cleaning. My sons are at the age where we are transitioning them to regular cups and these are perfect for that in-between stage.These are also labeled plastic type 5 which is polypropylene which is considered safe and does not leach BPA (bisphenol-A) into foods and beverages like some plastics can. That makes me feel better and sets my mind at ease about using these with my children.These are cheap enough where I can keep extras in my car and diaper bag in case I need them on the run. The 7-oz size is perfect for smaller children and the 10-oz size is perfect for toddlers."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I suggest starting this tea a few days before your cycle, and continue a few days afterward. The taste is not awesome, but it did seem to help."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"If you like a drop of heat on your food, this is the product for you!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I really liked this warmer. I was given one when my first daughter was born. As some of the reviews state, it may take a little practise to get used to how much water to put in, but that doesn't take much to master. The only recommendation that I have is that if you use the Dr. Brown's bottles with the tubes in them, take the tubes out before putting the bottle in the warmer, or you'll end up with the milk leaking into the warmer."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"My husband and I are crazy about these brownies! They are fresh and ready to eat in no time at all with a chewy, gooey, chocolate-y flavor. I like to add a scoop of Frozen Cherry Yogurt to the top of the still-warm brownie.Did I tell you how easy they are to mix-up? The package is complete. You just add some yogurt. And the best part...it's easy to just mix enough for a couple of brownies and then pop them in the microwave. That's if you don't want to mix up (and probably eat) the whole pan at once.I also like the packaging for these. The boxes stand up easily in my pantry and because of the hot pink color they are always very easy to find. These are a wonderful treat that you really don't have to feel bad about enjoying. I give them 4 stars only because I think they are a bit pricey...but then, as we all know, usually you get what you pay for. Recommended!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,"Well its actually a ""Pork Stick"" but I think its even better than beef jerky. I am a big fan of beef jerky but this just blows it away. My whole family loves this stuff and its made right here in Indiana. Totally worth it for the best pork stick you will ever have!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"ISS Complete Whey Powder dissolves better than any other whey powder I've tried, and I have tried a lot of whey powders (I have a reaction to soy). This whey powder still does not always dissolve completely and can leave a few lumps in liquid, so I give it 4 stars instead of 5."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,bought this for my first pregnancy...so comfy but it takes up a lot of space. Now my 1 year old plays with it. Great for first time pregnancy!
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"I've had one of these in my ditty bag for well over 15 years & have allways been pleased with it. Then it mysteriously disappeared. Probably one of the joys of having children... I checked all the drug & grocery stores & could not find a replacement, but Amazon had it. It looks & works just like the old one, great!My technique has allways been to center the blackhead or pimple or pussy mosquito bite under the smallest hole that seems appropriate & apply massive pressure untill stuff pops thru the hole. Then if there's blood, put a dab of neosporin on it."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Effective, comfortable, compact, what can I say? The best of any manual pump I've ever tried."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I always hate receiving and item in the mail that can be plugged in, but doesn't come with the required cords. Faced with scrounging up some batteries or finding a cord, I opted to dig up an adapter...bad idea. The unit started vibrating. I put my feet on it and had to press them down pretty hard to feel the weak vibration. I could have just set my cell phone to vibrate and placed my feet on it and got about the same quality massage. A few minutes later, I noticed a funny smell and realized that the unit was smoking. I guess using electric power instead of battery power was too much for the old girl. The inner plastic battery casing actually started to melt. I am glad I turned it off before I got burned."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,1.0,This item was not waht I wanted. I had ordered it for my mother to remind her to take her afternoon medication. Turns out it is a timer that has to be set every time it is used rather than an alarm clock type that can be set once and will alarm each day at the same time. My fault I guess but I can't see why anyone would want a timer that they have to set each time to remind them to take medication. Seems like it would be easier just remember to take the pills than to have to remember to set the timer too.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Expiration Date very close to maturity, which does not has time for one person to consume the entire product. I don't liked it."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,nuts seeds,5.0,"That is how good they are. Simple, but oh so yummy.Growing up as a child in Oregon, my health conscientious parents allowed me no ""candy"" only these and raisins. So they have many years of great childhood memories attached to them.0% Cholesterol, 6 grams of protein in each package of 4 little wafers. Very good for Vegetarian diets."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"If you like crunchy, if you like hard flatbreads - these are for you! They're good with cheese, peanut butter or all by themselves. I eat them instead of chips. I've tried several different flavors, but prefer the Spelt. They are healthy, filling & satisfying. The seeds just add a little extra too. I highly recommend them."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"When mixed with 500mL of milk, this tastes like Banana Cream Pie, and has almost 80g of Protein. Tastes good, works good. Much recommended."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"The disposable cups are perfect to have at work. Just fill with milk, eat and throw away. No need to cleanup!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have regular kidney stones that require management, but within the two years that I've been taking Uriflow, I have not had any obstructions. I hope that further research is done on this product because I believe that it works."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"I have been buying them locally at a natural foods grocery for the past 6 years, and I just love them. I took a chance on buying a case from Amazon, and I received a fresh product, no problems with close expiration date. If you love the corn chips of the major brand, and you would like a healthier version, please try these. They are delicious! In the off chance that you receive a product close to expiration date, just contact Amazon customer service, they'll resolve it for you right away."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,I have used the Alli for about a moth now and am down 15 pounds. It works great if you follow the instructions and exercise with it. I will definitely continue to use this product.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"HI this rice is great and microwaves in a snap, being so extremely busy it is great to be able to quickly in a minute or two prepare the rice and add either butter or seasonings, I highly recommend it."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,4.0,Delivered fine but took a tad long IMO .. six or 7 days.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,These are perfect for keeping in the diaper bag and putting on tables when you go out to eat.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I'm a coffee drinker so this is for my wife who reports it is way better (better taste, stronger brew per bag) than any Lipton or Trader Joe teas."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I had a problem with Plantar faciatis, and my foot doc recommended an orthotic. I bought these both locally and online and I love them!! I pulled the stock insoles out of my Nikes and installed these, and everything feels great. I bought three pairs, one for my running shoes, one for work, and one for my yard work shoes and I'm very happy! My Plantar faciatis seems to be improving, too! But even if it subsides completely, I will stick with these because they feel so good!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Fast shipping and great price. This tea is awsome. My college student drinks this tea before tests and important phsyical activities. Highly recommended.
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I purchased two of the slipcovers as gifts for a joint babyshower. Everyone was very impressed with the fabric and construction. The cover is think and soft, the fabrics coordinate beautifully, and I'm told that the covers wash well. I would definitely give these as gifts again."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Great coffee - received it as a gift from folks who traveled to Costa Rica and bought it off the plantation. Had to have more - and found it here! I've ordered several times, and have given it as gifts to others. Wonderful coffee and prompt service from this company. Would highly recommend them."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,2.0,"I bought this cup for my son transition from bottles, after having tried Nuk training cup unsucessfully ( he could never get the liquid from the spout without leaking). Unfortunately I liked the cup shape, easy to clean, he could easily drink from it, but for my surprise it pours if you hold it up side down."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"The ""TEs"" are there if you eat more than the recommended amount fat. I have never had a loss of control, but when I go to the bathroom, I can see the effects of what I have eaten and it is oddly comforting. It makes you think, ""if that came out, and it is only 25%, what stayed??!!!"" So, therefore, I think that it is a great product."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,I have tried several different progesterone creams and this is my favorite. I love the feel of the cream and especially the rosemary scent. I've tried more expensive and well-known brands and have not had the success I have had with this one. One of the more expensive brands made me break out in a rash. So I'm not buying this because it is cheaper; it's just better! I sleep better and feel calmer.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,1.0,"I thought these were just awful. Terribly, terribly salty, with no other taste. My husband, who is a cheese lover, really liked them and ate them all. So not a total loss."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I bought these bottles for storing pumped breast milk (which is what they are intended for) and they have a strong chemical smell. I followed the directions on the box and boiled the parts for 5 minutes before use. I then washed them and rinsed them thoroughly. No matter how many times I wash them, the chemical smell does NOT go away. I will not be using these to store milk. If I can smell chemicals I don't think it is safe for the storage of milk which will be consumed by my 2 month old baby!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I have two brushes, one that is an advent, long and skinny with soft bristles that i love, the nipple part is hard plastic though so im careful with it. Then i got this brush for upstairs, i use it with Born free bottles and although it does do a decent job, it sprays everywhere when you take it out and you really have to scrub around, which sometimes seems to scratch my bottles. i think i prefer the advent softer bristles, also because yo can see what you are cleaning. im always afraid the munchkin nipple brush is going to tear the nipple."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,1.0,"Was looking forward to lovely whole wheat looking and tasting couscous, and got the same white bland tasting stuff I can buy at the local store for a whole lot less money."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I think that this kit is a great value for the money. That mat is comfortable and seems sturdy. Would recommend for others to purchase.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I have always used Flexall mostly for relief from aches and muscle soreness. I have no plans to switch to another product because this product works well for me.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"I found this product very effective for relieving muscle tension. It was better for upper back than lower -- didn't really reach that low, and I am 5'6"". The product had a faulty cord and would stop / resume operation if the cord was jiggled. Now after 8 months, it has completely stopped working. I am contacting Homedics to see if they can help me as it should be under warranty. It would be great if Homedics could produce this with better quality, and quieter. The noise is enough to interfere with hearing the TV if your volume is low. If the unit was not defective and quieter, I would give it 4 stars."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,This item was purchased for another person with NO online access and I couldn't tell you anything of the recipient's comments or what opinions he or she may have. Sorry.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"These are OK, but I am not sure how reliable they are as compared to more expensive products. They are harder to use, because they are small."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I was shocked at how huge it is, difficult to find room for it in the pantry. That is the only criticism. Otherwise, my husband - who likes vanilla - says it is delicious."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,My wife and I enjoy a pot of Green Chai Tea each morning. It has a great flavor. It is a little hard to find in grocery stores at the quantity that we like. Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"After growing up on a farm my ears were trained to the quiet life, I moved to the big city. Upon living here I discovered that my neighbors like to drink a lot, play dominoes, fight, call each other horrible names, and not use quiet inside voices while addressing their friends as ""Dawg and G"" and play this redundant music called Crunk or Crap or whatever. SO, after several visits with my shrink I realized I didn't need to pay her to complain about how loud my neighbors were, but just buy the little white noise machine she had outside her office door. The sleep I lost was soon made up, I no longer scowl at my neighbors for being loud asshats, and I sleep soundly albeit the occasional gunshot or fireworks in the middle of the night. My husband and I are even more relaxed because of it."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,5.0,"I got this item for my office pantry and have been selling it at cost for 50 cents a bag. It has been well-received and sells quickly. Most people like that it is tasty, but not incredibly bad for you. Although for a family of 4, buying 72 bags of this stuff would be a little too much of the same thing. Overall, a real crowd pleaser!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,5.0,this is super delicious. My daughter eats it practically 1 every single day. It's not very sugary sweet like those fruit snacks. It has no preservatives/addictives... Actually even my hubby likes this as well. All flavors are good.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had severe shoulder pain and tried all of the heat and cold products out there. Then I came across some sample packets of BioFreeze Gel that I had received at a health fair. I used the BioFreeze on my shoulder and it worked great at relieving the pain. I tried to find it in a local drug store, and found that it is not sold in drug stores. I was told I had to purchase it from a therapist or other medical professional. After doing some research online, I found it on Amazon.com, and at a better price than other sites. I have since been going to a therapist for the shoulder, and they agree that BioFreeze is the ointment to use. They have a huge pump bottle of it in the therapy clinic. I highly recommend this product for pain relief of sore muscles or bursitis."

I cannot have lactose products and have difficulty finding a protein drink that doesn't upset the stomach. This one doesn't. The taste is good & it mixes better than many brands (We use a fork instead of spoon to mix!) I carefully scrutinized the ingredients, the nutritional value etc. and found this particular brand/type to be the best overall and the most tolerable on the stomach. The price was competitive, too. Good purchase..."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,I AM VERY SATISIFIED WITH THE SUPER CLEANSE SYSTEM.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"please don't buy into the hype or the hope that you'll find an easy, simple way to achieve a huge jump in physical well-being. The results of this product are totally unsupported scientifically and psychosomatic when consumers rave about it. I tried the product with the Cleanse and Colon pill pre-treatment. Absolutely no benefit. I didn't feel any better, lose any weight, feel any stronger or lighter or clear-headed. Scam."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've been taking this for the past five weeks and have made noticeable gains. My recovery time is cut in half, and the sustained energy during workouts is also quite noticeable. I'm benching with 255lbs x 6instead of the normal 225lb x 6. Dumbell curl with 60 lbs instad of the usual 45 lbs. Arms are stretching the tape at 17 1/2 inches, before they were a tad under 17. I have to say, this product is working well for me so far. However, during the loading phoase, I cramped a little bit, but my water intake wasn't as high as it probably should have been. Also, I take only one serving a day instead of the recommended two. By taking only one serving daily, I find that I need less water to stay hydrated, and still manage to make new gains in size and strength."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Having been using this product for awhile, I definitely recommend it for problems with irregularity. It is working wonderfully for me and is extremely easy to use."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"We bought this pump as an emergency backup. It is good enough to be a cheap item that you keep in your car, but I'd never have considered this to replace my Medela Pump In Style Advanced.The reason why the dual pump gets lower reviews than the single is that the second pump is daisy-chained off the first -- so you're getting the same amount of suction for both breasts (you can use only the one at a time, though). Not conducive to pumping more than a couple of ounces, if you're lucky. The four-ounce capacity of the bottles is rather optimistic, in my opinion, especially since the entire unit can run on 3 AA batteries.So, if you're stuck somewhere and desperately need to pump off a bit of excess, you can use this unit. It rates better than a manual pump simply because at least you don't end up with sore hands as well. Understand, however, that you'll still have to hold onto the pump(s) as you go -- so driving while pumping is out of the question!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was following the Eat Right for your Blood type diet and found a recipe for 8 oz of cold pineapple juice, one tbs of flax seed oil,and one tbls of these granules mixed in the morning with breakfast. It emulsifies easily and is easy to digest. It is refreshing every morning. The product was packed well and came quickly. I can recommend the service via Amazon for getting it here as a product that worked."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"My Italian grandmother got me hooked on Lipton Loose Tea as a child. Tea is important to me- I never have gotten into coffee. It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets, so I have tried to find something to replace it- more expensive, ""fancier"" teas just aren't as good. This is a great product- sooo much better than tea bags. We like it hot &/or iced. People always ask me ""What kind of tea is this?"" and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable Lipton. Tea lovers- don't be snobs! Give Lipton Loose Tea a try. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,I ordered what I thought was the large biotone and like the other guy got half of what I thought I was recieving. I could have gone to BioTone and gotten it for $10.00 more and gotten the large size.Shipping lately with Amazon has been bad at best.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,4.0,"This trail mix was good because it had healthy ingredients and lacked all the fake stuff others include. My husband really enjoyed this as did my daughter. We can't buy it again since my son is allergic to peanuts now. Otherwise, I would buy it again. Good price here too."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product mixes easily, I use a shaker bottle and it does the job.Taste is good, not very strong, not strong at all, which I like. I was worried that it would have a strong taste of chocolate or might be too sweet, but it is not like that at all. The reason for which I bought this product is because it is one of the cleanest out on the market. I wanted to stay away from artificial stuff and all sorts of sugars, and it has a good mix of protein, carbs and fats. I bought several packages and intend to buy more when I'll run out. The flavor I like the most so far is oatmeal cinnamon."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"First off, I agree with the writer who went on and on about the benefits (or lack thereof) of magnets in this application. And yet, try to find a knee device that can provide hot or cold therapy at a better price. Good luck! Most comparable items sell in the mid $30 range and up. I have bad knees and these wraps are indispensible. As for the magnets, who cares? As long as they don't do any damage (no scientific evidence of that either), no big deal."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After taking traditional antidepressents of various names and having all kinds of side effects (can you believe suicide is one side effect ? - hello!), I found this natural supplement. I love the ease of one tablet daily, and these for some reason work the best of any other brand I've tried, so I'm sticking with them. They are not a miracle cure, but they really do take the edge off depression and help you function much better with no side effects. Drinking enough water and getting sunlight or supplementing Vitamin D3 along with a good multivitamin helps alot too. They also seem to work faster than traditional medicine so you don't have to wait to get relief."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I first took creatine about 10 years ago and it made me gain a ton of water in my body. It also made me constantly thirsty. I stopped after a month and never went back after that bloating experience. After getting back in to lifting the past year, I tried No Xplode which gave me the energy to work out hard. You have to get off No Xplode after a month or two because that one scoop doesn't work as well as the first month because your body gets used to it. Btw No Xplode does not advertise how much caffeine is in it.Anyways, a budy of mine who used to compete in the amateur bodybuilding circuit told me to take Cellmass. He told me several times over and over until I finally did. I am really glad I did! Cellmass mixes very well with water and is not like the sandy creatine in other products. Cellmass' creatine is micronized which explains the ton of dust when you open up the container (trust me on this and don't inhale when you open the container or pour the scoop or you will sneeze). Cellmass does not make you bloat what so ever. I did notice the constaint gains in my bench presses every week. I gained about 15 lbs every two weeks and now am now peaked since I stopped taking it. It is amazing when you can't bench something and then a month later you are doing several reps of the same weight. I tried the NSM version of creatine which is cheaper in price, but it is very sandy and does not mix well with water. Save your money by not buying the cheaper forms of creatine. Cellmass is pricy but you really get what you pay for. I also noticed that my recovery time is extended by a day or two more since I stopped taking it. I only tried the grape flavor so far."

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I've tried many sleep masks over the years and have never been satisfied with any of them - until now. Most sleep masks have a small elastic band that stretches out quickly, making it worthless, or lets light in around the nasal area because they don't fit correctly. This sleep mask is perfect in many ways. It has a wide, sturdy elastic band with a velcro fastener that allows for comfort, fit, and longevity. It also has a nose hood to prevent light from disturbing your sleep and even has convex pockets so the mask doesn't touch your eyes or lashes while you sleep. On top of all that, it's made of a soft, durable material that is a pleasure to the skin. I've used my sleep mask for awhile now and I can find nothing negative to say about it. In fact, I can't sleep without it! Whoever designed it really knew what they were doing, and I heartily recommend it. It's a great product, worth every penny!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I've tried almost EVERY bar there is out there! Learned the hard way not to JUST look at the protein to carb,to fat ratios!Watch out for the myriad of bars with sucrolose & other ""BAD"" sweetners! If you aren't up on them, do a google search & read the negative side effects instead of the advertising hype put out by the manufacturers!The balance bars have NO SUCROLOSE or artificial sweetners !! YAY!!Even though I PREFER the protein to be from ANYTHING other than soy.... which sadly these are.........I cannot help but buy cases of these that I ""rotate"" with my 'healthier"" non-soy"" bars WHY?? You might ask............it's because they taste so GOOD! I absolutely LOVE the latest line up of ""Bare Bars"" so do my kids, we take out 4 different bars EVERY morning & cut them up so everyone gets some of each flavor, YUMMM!! then somedays we cannot help ourselves & have to open up 4 more!! LOL :-)This is what we refer to as our 1st breakfast VERY eary in the morning when we all gather for a cup of tea or milk, & have family devotions, then after household chores are completed & our school day begins the kids have their second breakfast, I go off to do my workout, usually weights for 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes, then I get my second ""breakfast""of a Bare bar, currently LOVING chocolate almond or a mix of pieces of Balance bars & others like the Cliff Builders bars (the Vanilla Almond is my fav there) or a thinkthin chunky Peanut, to keep my muscles refueled to rebuild & keep my metabolism boosted!It works well for me, I am 50 years old 5'5' (about) & weigh 110 to 115, & a size 4! There are other foods that can do the same thing, but they don't satisfy a sweet craving like these babies do! I just have to hide my fav's from the kids!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"Veja-Links are a soy ""hot dog"" that is a nice alternative to the real thing. I really like to use them to make a spread. Boiled eggs, onion, relish and ground up Veja-links makes a good sandwich spread. You can grill them or make pigs-in-a-blanket just like you would with real hot dogs. The one thing that is different is no animal ""by products"" whatever that means."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"My absolute favorite is German Chocolate Cake but I've found it to be a mix that can often turn out dry. That is not what I want in a cake. My sister-in-law substituted chocolate cake mix last summer and that is our new tradition.This mix is my family's favorite because it is just what it says... SUPER MOIST. The rich chocolate flavor compliments my Grandmother's recipe for homemade buttery, pecan and coconut frosting. Add a thin layer of warm frosting to the cake layers and let it soak in deep. Once the frosting is cooled, frost as usual. I make a three layer cake in a heart shaped pan then display it in a glass domed cake plate. This cake is warm, soft and delicious served the same day and even more flavorful the next day.The kids love the cake mix when you add chocolate chips and make cupcakes. Vanilla frosting and sprinkles top off their favorite.More recently I used it to make a chocolate gooey butter cake. Made the recipe as written but substituted chocolate cake mix for the yellow cake mix the recipe called for and added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cream cheese topping. Rich and decadent. Yum."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"***Editing this now to note that the review was for the original Lansinoh, NOT the Affinity, which I have not used, and which was either not available, or not commonly available in 2008. It looks like the listing was changed to point to a different product.***Most of it's been said already, so I'll try to keep this fairly brief. This is the same as the Ameda Purely Yours, so make sure to check reviews on it as well.I use this pump about three times a day in an effort to build up a frozen milk stash before returning to work. While the power adapter is large and heavy, the pump and horns are surprisingly light and small. The whole thing fits nicely in the diaper bag we were given in the hospital, with room to spare. The parts that come into contact with milk (horns, rubber valves, silicone membranes) wash up easily with a bottle brush and unscented dish soap, and fit on any standard sized bottle you'd like to use. I figure that the milk's in the horns only briefly, so BPA contact is minimal, and using third-party bottles lets you avoid contact there.It's no louder than the Medela swing, which I started with, but it's a double pump, and the horns feel comfier to me.Just a few hints I haven't seen yet:-If you cut slits down the front of a sturdy bra, you can insert the horns, and pump hands-free. If said bra has a lace or fabric overlay, push that back rather than cutting through it, and use it to cover the slits when wearing the bra normally. There are instructions online on using hair elastics to suspend pumps from a nursing bra, also.-Alternating between high speed/low suction, and low speed/high suction got the most milk for me. Just switch when it stops flowing. It's more comfortable than consistent high speed and/or suction, too. I love that the pump has separate controls which makes this possible.-The sample Lansinoh milk bags that came with this pump fit in Playtex drop-in bottles. Didn't see that noted on the package, but it's good to know.-If you pump as much as you can, and then feed your baby, he or she will still get enough to eat. The best pump is no match for an infant, who will be able to get milk the pump couldn't, so if you're trying to increase your supply, this may help."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"We were introduced to this soy sause from a friend in Bali. I was thrilled to find we could purchase it on the internet. Kecap Manis Sweet Soy Sause is the perfect addition to teriyake marinades for chicken, beef and fish. The thick sweetness brightens marinades and also adds a perfect thickner to glazes. I use this sause (as it is sweeter and thicker) to regular soy sause. I love the fact that it comes in big bottles, and through this venue is reasonably priced! Will be making another order soon! Wonderful over steamed rice ~Barb in California"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,1.0,I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink.

Very easy to eat, light crunch and that carmel corn flavor without the flossing afterwards! My son is allergic to peanuts and Robert's snacks do not have them nor are they made in a plant with them. Check out thier website. Only a few items run the risk of peanuts in them. Will buy again!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is the best iced tea I've ever tasted! And the cold brewing makes it so easy. I brew it longer than the instructions call for (a half hour - I like it strong!) and I add fresh mint leaves and agave syrup for sweetness. Awesome! The Celestial Seasonings Tropical Fruit Iced Tea is also great - a nice alternative for those who prefer decaf or herbal tea.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Great product and a pretty good value. I ordered the chocolate flavor and it tastes great while contains no artificial additives and no sugar. Powder mixes fairly easily in a shaker bottle - 20 sec shake leaves no clumps.

I bought it on a whim at GNC and started taking them. I ran out and it took me a couple of weeks before I could get back to the store. In that time I realized that I started feeling tired again after a long day at the office. I bought another bottle and after a few days I got my energy back. So, after my own testing, I think that the ingredients in this product really do help you feel better and more energetic. I'm told it's the large dose of B vitamins."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I have to agree with ""R.Katz"" They are incredibly chalky and cardboard like. They also have a strong dark chocolate taste. I don't particularly enjoy dark chocolate; those that do might enjoy these.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I love peanut butter so I might be bias, but these are the best Balance Bars available. They are soft, chewable and have great flavor. The bars I received 9/15/2008 expire 06/2009. So there is no issue here with expired bars. Great product! Use Subscribe & Save and do exactly that.

There are quite a few variants on quantity and packaging. For the expert, no problem, but for a novice, a more detailed intro would be good.Delivery was just fine. The only, and minor, issue is that delivery was not trackable, probably due to third party supplier.That said, I will certainly consider Amazon for products like hibiclens again. Other than the minor details noted, Amazon's excellent customer service is evident."

The pain in me arch and heels almost completly stopped in just a couple days of use. I am on my feet over 12+ hours a day and they have made this much easier to do. After a few weeks of using in my shoes on even very uneven ground the pain is still 95% reduced. Pain I had after standing up after down time is also mostly non existant. These come with three choices of adjustability , by the addition of wedges that insert in the underside of the pad. I have only used the heavy wedges in these , and have not tried the lower ones as they just look like too slight of a change. I am glad I tried these and at this price I would suggest them to others."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,I usually hate jarred sauces. This Vodka sauce by Victoria's is the best. My family goes crazy for it. I've tried to make my own and it doesn't come out nearly as good. This is the only jarred vodka sauce that I will ever buy.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I was a little worried buying this since some other reviews on this product (other flavors) listed it as gritty and having an aftertaste. I found this to be VERY smooth, lovely flavor, and I think I have my new favorite shake! I do need to mention that I added about a cup of milk to the 8 oz of water, I just like my shakes with milk. I have tried almost every shake out there, and this one keeps me full longer, the calories are excellently low (130), and only 1g of sugar! WOW! Here are the specs, since I had a hard time finding them:Calories"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've used Lactaid for years, and as the years pass, the product keeps getting better and better. I used to have to take more of it for it to work, now I use one tablet just before eating the serving of dairy, and one tablet in the middle of eating the serving of dairy. It works great! One thing to be careful about though, is if you are as slow eater, you'll have to take more of it. When I eat a bagel with cream cheese for example, which takes more chewing than does ice cream which takes none, I end up using three tablets instead of two to be symptom free (e.g., one at the beginning, then I eat 1/3 bagel/cream cheese, take another, eat another 1/3, then take last pill for last 1/3 of bagel). Another great tip which I discovered.....when I began taking calcium supplements along with the Lactaid, it made my own symptoms disappear completely, so you might give that a try. My doctor says its probably because calcium supplements slow movement of the digestive tract. All in all, Lactaid Fast Act is a great product for lactose intolerant individuals and I highly recommend it."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"I randomly love the Chai Tea flavor which is impossible to find in retail locations nowadays, but I found it on Amazon. The box came in perfect condition, the bars were tasty and fresh, and I'm almost ready for a new box! If you're not big on spices found in actual Chai Tea this may not be for you, especially the strong taste of cinnamon and cardamom, but I love it."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I have tried everything and this really is the best I've found so far. Mine lasted around 4 months and I bought another one. It is too expensive for what it is, I think the company that makes this could sell it for $20 and still make a profit. But it still beats what the dentist would charge. It's available at Target stores which makes it easy to obtain."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have big problems falling asleep and staying asleep since I have chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and a few other things that contribute. I have tried a lot of sleep-type products, but St Johns Wort actually gives results. I take 1-2 tablets before going to bed, and I get good quality sleep. SJW acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which means that it blocks the body's breakdown of serotonin so that the serotonin can be used where needed. Serotonin allows you to sleep better, as it's an important brain chemical. There are, of course, pharmaceutical versions of SSRIs that you can take for this condition, but I would much rather take a natural version like SJW and avoid the liver damage that comes with all pharmaceuticals."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I got this tea imagining it might not taste that good since it is for appetite control, but boy was I wrong! The tea tastes great. There is some stevia in it so it is a little sweet without sugar. It has a few berry flavors that really mix well. It is now one of my favorite Yogi teas."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I received this tea box as a gift from a coworker. I'm a big tea drinker and I've tried many brands and varieties of tea. The tea tasted weak and stale to me. The wrappers are a thin paper, and that might be a contributing factor to the decline in taste. I tried every flavor once and now the box just sits in my cabinet. I feel that Bigelow's tea is far superior to Bentley's and would avoid drinking Bentley's in the future."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"TwinLab propolis extract tastes good without bitterness. It also contains other herbs to boast the immune system. I am a hepatitis B carrier for many years. Last summer (2007), my ALT was 171 IU/ml and my hepatitis virus count was 56,000,000 copies/ml. I started taking a variety of bee propolis extracts including TwinLab propolis extract since last December, 2007. My blood test results in April, 2008 were a big surprise to me and my physician. My ALT was 33 and my blood virus level was down to 19,000 copies/ml. My virus level was 9,700 copies/ml in my blood test in August, 2008. I feel better and look better also. I was prescribed to take Hepsera, which inhibits the proliferation of the hepatitis virus. However, there are side effects and drug resistance may develop. Furthermore, I was told I will have to take it for life. There are many pre-clinical studies of propolis extracts in small animals suggesting propolis extracts inhibit bacterial, viral and fungal replications. Furthermore, propolis extracts enhance the immune system to destroy these micro-organisms and also provide other benefits. So far, propolis extracts work for me. However, one should have regular checkup and have blood test to monitor one's state of health as propolis extracts have not been approved by the FDA to treat chronic hepatitis B."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,5.0,"It speaks for itself. San Pellegrino with a slight touch of orange. Funny thing about it...when you're thirsty, it does two things. It quenches your thirst and gives you a sense of a fresh cut orange thrown smack dab in your face."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,I was very upset when this product arrived. Had I known there were only 12 bars I would have went to my local supermarket and gotten them for only $14.00 rather than spending $42.00. All the other Slimfast bars I purchase from Amazon are 6 boxes of 6 bars for $40.00. How does 1/3 the amount of bars cost $2.00 more?

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was diagnosed with Celiac late in life and so have major damage to my small intestines. Before I found Essential Enzymes my body wasn't able to break down and absorb the nutrients in my food very well. But from the first day I used this product I could tell the difference. I usually take 2-3 pills before eating, depending on how hard the food item is to digest. If I forget, my intestines let me know. This product is the best. And through Amazon, it's very affordable."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"A biochemist friend suggested I try 5-HTP for sleep-related problems. Very skeptical at first, I became a believer. After one month of regular use, I seem to be sleeping beter, not foggy or tired in the AM. No side effects that I can tell. Great discovery!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This is a great product. I recommend it to anyone with back or neck problems or who gets headaches.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,3.0,"I suppose this product will help, but nobody has wet it yet except for the copious sweat my wife produces while sleeping on rubber. It tends also to get some pretty permanent wrinkles in it, but I guess that goes with any rubber sheet. We have it under the bottom bedsheet, so it's hard to smooth out the wrinkles.JL"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"I purchased these pretzels for our small natural foods store. They were an instant hit. The flavor is really nice - not too salty, and the sesame seeds are a nice touch. And 100% whole-wheat? Where can you find a nutritious snack like that? Personally I don't snack, but I have been known to grab a bag of these along with a piece of fruit for a light supper if I'm in a rush. I will definitely be reordering these."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I was wrong when I suspected the kit to be complicated and the results to be ambiguous - after all, drawing blood and playing CSI is for professionals, right? Nope - the kit is so easy a child could do it. And the results are easy to read - at least mine were - there wasn't much room for misinterpretation. The instructions seem a little complicated at first glance - but at the beginning they suggest you go to their website to watch a short but comprehensive video. The video shows how simple it is to use.PROBLEM"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This product is so great! I can't praise it more. I don't think there is an aftertast, althugh some other people in my family have mentioned that it does. I love that it's so convenient. I pour it in my coffee and use it for baking. I love it so much I have a subscription."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"I tried Pamela's Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed. I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes. Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey. My non-GF family & friends said they were ""weird"" and ""different"". Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another. I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,It is always a pleasure doing business with Amazon. They are accurate and promp. My feedback is POSITIVE!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I've only had this kit for a short while, but I have found it to be incredibly useful! Anytime something happens with my toddler, I can find a remedy in this kit. When he falls and gets a goose-egg, there's the Bumps and Bruises balm. If it's an open wound, the Arnica heals it quickly (my kid is constantly in motion and falls a lot). I just today gave him some of the Hepar Sulph. Calc. for a particularly bad virus, and it seemed to make him feel much better. He went from crying and lying on the floor to playing and dancing around. This kit has been really fantastic for us!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"If anything can actually be better than food, this snack certainly fits the bill. You gotta try them. They're tasty, crunchy and just plan corney. Like the ""bottom of the pot"" kernels we used to fight over as kids, these kernels fit the bill. However, we no longer have to fight over them cause the bag is full of them! Great job in creating these things. Now excuse me as I nibble on some more."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"The Sleepright night guard is the worst possible solution you could use for teeth grinding/aka Bruxism. According too many Dental professionals it is a short term solution to a long term problem with serious side affects at best. I have been chewing through my SleepRight so many times it is ridiculous. The company is aware of the problem as well as the serious side affects that can occur to the bite and yet does zero about it. It seems their only concern is the all mighty dollar. Their customer service leaves much to be desired for as well. Getting someone to return your phone call after many complaints is a challenge, and usually they blame their after hours call center on not forwarding messages. My Orthodontist said that I should immediately stop using this product after I brought it into him for an evaluation, and that ""Splints"" like the one I brought him often cause more harm then good. I would never recommend this product to anyone who suffers from teeth grinding. All this product is designed to do is empty your wallet and successfully fail at helping to alleviate your condition."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Some of the other reviewers were disappointed when a miracle hadn't occurred after 5 days, & gave up on it. Hey, I have fought IBS for 20 years; I'm going to give it time to work before I write it off. And to my complete surprise, it did. No more pain, cramping, & paranoid need to know where the closest bathroom will be (if I did dare to go somewhere without taking a dose of Immodium ahead of time.) It is not a cure; it is a CONTROL. As the packaging warns you, if you don't stay with it, the IBS will return within days. Taking the pill every day is a small price to pay for freedom from being ""caught"" somewhere. I can make plans with complete peace of mind. But you do have to allow the probiotics time to kick in. It took almost 3 weeks for me to notice a change, but after a month, it worked consistently well for me. I signed up for the auto delivery option; I like that IBS no longer rules my life."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"I have taken Ginkgo Biloba with Vinpocetine 60 mg softgels for years with no problem. But the company must have changed their formula. Now the minute you open the bottle, you are assaulted by an obnoxious smell, so bad that one of my family members gagged. In about 60 seconds the odor from the open bottle completely filled the room and we had to leave. The odor smells like dirty toilet. Bought another bottle with a different expiration date and lot number. Same result. I will never buy this product again."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,1.0,"I purchased this product (3 packs) to make Sushi for our family of four. The Nori or Seaweed Wrap is very small, a little less than 2"" x 4"" which makes it very hard to make a simple California Roll with crab, cucumber, and avocado. Once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut, but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi. The sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of Nori could take. Don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun, however, may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi. I'll buy the bigger sheets for sushi next time..."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"We love this item because it very simply compresses milk bags so they freeze flat. This maximizes space in the freezer. The container is also excellent in that it keeps milk date-organized ~ My husband has no problem grabbing the front bag...the latest date while leaving the most recent in the back. :) Makes milk freezing and storage simple, quick and easy. We have found it holds 10 frozen bags with 5oz of milk per bag. The lid can be used to organize additional frozen bags (holds an additional 11-12 frozen 5oz bags) or it snaps on as a lid."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,1.0,"I have tried other items from Marshall Creek and was very pleased. BUT, the fennel seeds have NO flavor or aroma! It tastes like chaff. Too old? Bad batch? Don't know but not usable."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,2.0,"I've been on a low carb/low calorie diet for a couple years now so I've tried quite a few food items. I picked up these CarbRite Chocolate Brownie bars at my local health store since they were one of the lower-priced items. I can honestly say you can tell it's a diet bar. The chocolate isn't that smooth and the taste is a bit off. I still think the 2.5 net carbs & 190 cals for my work lunch are a payoff. I try my protein bars frozen but these seem to stay a bit chewy in the center, no matter how cold. I'm already not a big fan of chocolate, so I will be trying the other flavors soon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Great product. Used a prescription retinol years ago but had to stop because of severe drying and unsightly blotches. This product is much gentler, and after only a few weeks, my skin has improved in appearance, texture, and feels much softer. Do use a good moisturizer as some flaking does occur. It is manageable though with moisturizer."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,The flavor only slightly resembled a peach. It tasted more like the pit instead of the fleshy fruit.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,We love this product for our son. Every time he has a very severe diaper rash he takes a sitzbath with a few drops of Kamillosan and it works wonders. Some Zinkoxide cream over night and the next day he's totally fine. Wonderful product. I wish we could get it in the store!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,Doesn't taste like I expected. Tastes like blueberries with a hint of metal. Hmmm. Common to all muscle milk but doesn't go good with blueberries.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"If you have a long cycle, expect to use 20 sticks that first month since the machine starts you testing on day six and if you have not peaked by day fifteen it will ask you to test clear past your peak day and all the way to day twenty-five. Lesson learned after I had to buy another box of sticks to finish out month two when it started me testing on day eight. I think next month I will just time it so I only have to use half a box per cycle (15 sticks). Just start testing a few days later than the machine tells me to and stop testing after peak day will certainly cut down on stick usage and cost.Cons -- After you have spent morning after morning looking at the lines on the stick and seeing which one(s) show, it is easy to predict what the machine is going to say. I sort of feel ripped off by having to use the machine to tell me what I can plainly see with my own eyes. But the machine makes it easy to keep track of cycle days and it is an easy reminder to test, so I am not overly upset.I also find it easier and more accurate to use the ""dip in a cup"" method over the ""running stream"" method. Just use a disposable Dixie cup - much less messy and splashy.I am not sorry I bought the system -- I just need to tweak it a bit so that the sticks actually last me for three months. Gave it four stars because it DOES what it is supposed to do, took away one star because it gets expensive to use as directed if you have any issues at all with your cycle.My suggestion is to not rely too heavily on this machine and take the time to learn your body signs since sometimes signs come later in the day, even when you have had a low fertility reading in the morning. This is only an additional tool in natural family planning."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,This is not a great product. I have and recomend Docter Riter's Real Ease neck support. It is a much better product for those with neck pain.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"We love dry roasted edamame for its high protein, fiber, and delicious taste. I always keep a bag in my car and one in my backpack and give it to my kids for a quick and easy snack. It's a good alternative to sweet and expensive protein bars with even more protein."

health personal care,health care,incontinence,3.0,"With XL Depend Underwear as my standard, but suddenly unavailable, I bought my Father a case of the XL Prevail. An image forever branded on my brain is the paramedics picking him up off the floor - his underwear staying up around his waist and the absorbent pad part stretching down to his knees. I've helped him to the bathroom many a time, in various conditions with the Depend underwear, but never experienced anything like that.Could be just a difference in the 2 Products' definition of XL or more likely, differences in the construction of the disposable underwear."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My son loves these and begs to take his vitamins every day! And to be honest, they've become the vitamin both my husband and I take (my physician and my OB never had a problem with it, but I don't think they've heard if it's adequate for adults one way or the other). When I was pregnant, I started taking a different brand of gummy vitamins and an extra folate pill (morning sickness got the best of all the adult vitamins, whether pill or chewable, even low-iron). I got hooked and never went back to Centrum! Only complaint is they seem to disappear quickly and thus get pricey (when kid, mom, and now dad are taking them!). Taste better than Flintstone gummies, and about as good as Scooby Doo gummies, but cheaper and with more flavors."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"Why oh why do studios stamp ""Deluxe Edition"" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title?????? I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done. The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before. The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before. The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion. That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc. With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING. There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING. Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer. I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition. It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the ""Deluxe Edition"" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This stuff is great! I originally bought it for my mom. Unfortunately she passed away, and I found the bottle in my refrigerator after 2 years! I thought it would be bad, but I smelled it and it seemed OK. Also, being such a skinflint, I thought, well, I would try it, and see if it was still any good. Was it ever! I took some in the morning, and gave some to my husband too. (I figured if it was going to kill me, we might as well go together.) Needless to say, it didn't kill me. In fact it gave me a huge boost of energy. When my husband came home from work, he said he had exactly the same experience. And that was from a two year old bottle. Now we buy it regularly, and love it. It doesn't taste bad, and it doesn't ""repeat"" on me. I hate pills, so this liquid form suits me perfectly. Highly recommended."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I take Evening Primrose Oil to help control PMS symptoms and for my complexion. Thus far, this is the best value in Evening Primrose Oil capsules I have found, unless I run across a sale at my local store. This product arrived faster than I anticipated, as I did get a message about it being backordered. The bottle arrived in great condition too. I definitely recommend purchasing this supplement from this seller."

Attractive, easy clean-up and our daughter feels very safe and secure (the seat has a Bumbo Chair like design it, no sliding out..) We were torn between the Bloom Nano High Chair and this one and I feel like we made the right choice.... I highly recommend this chair for someone looking for a clean, modern high chair."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This heating pad lives up to the company's propaganda. It wraps around harder to cover shoulder areas and stays put, thanks to the elastic band. The five levels of heat are great and the automatic shut off is great when you fall asleep with the pad on."

health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"These are a live saver for every uncomfortable pair of pumps I own. I never have to sacrifice my tootsies for fashion again! The hardest part (for me) is finding the right spot to stick them. You have to be careful to only apply them once, twice if you absolutely have to, or the glue won't last and they'll start to slide. (I found this out when I got the heel cushions.) So if you're sitting there deciding on whether or not you should purchase these for your comfort, DO IT! You won't be disappointed. I only wish I found them earlier!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I absolutely love this pump. Its very comfortable and easy to use. Would recommend it very highly. Cut my pumping time in half.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I bought this machine to help drown out the noise of my husband's heavy breathing at night and it has done the trick. I love that it has a timer on it so I can set it for as long as I need to fall asleep and not waste electricity/batteries the whole night. You can dial the volume way up or way down which is great b/c other sound machines I had didn't get loud enough for me. I am planning on purchasing on for my baby who is due in Feb to create some white noise and help him sleep.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,2.0,"So this is bacteria, expensive bacteria. When the pharmacy orders it, it comes with ice packs. Why didn't it come with an ice pack? How much bacteria is alive after how many days in transit with the postal service? I even paid extra to have it shipped faster, thinking the ice might not be melted by the time it got here. Thank goodness I ordered the pills and not the yogurt. I'm wondering if any bacteria is even alive by the time it reached me."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have always been anemic. I've taken those awful iron pills which had an effect on my body that I don't like. I finally went to an acupuncturist who gave me this ""blood tonic"". After taking it for 2 days I noticed that I had more energy and could think more clearly. When I ran out my energy level went back down. My local health food store gave me a different brand and it doesn't work. This product helped me and did not give me any side effects. The increase in energy did not feel artificial (my heart wasn't racing etc). I'm so happy to find it on Amazon.com, I'm ordering a supply so I don't run out again."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more.Ramune six-packs are easy to find at just about any Asian market at around $7 or $8. If you have to order online, try some of the various Asian food sites out there as the price here is just too high to justify unless you have absolutely no other option.Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink."

Between the two, that covered appetite suppression, glucose levels, energy and stress.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Although I am not a health care professional, I thought I'd like to share with you my experience with this product as I truly think it is first rate.Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root is generally recommended for treatment of ulcers. Thank heaven, I don't have ulcers, but I have suffered from canker sores since childhood. I read somewhere that chewing DGL was helpful for canker sores. Well, it is more than helpful! I have been keeping a bottle of this in my cupboard for years and it is the only thing that works.I have found that if I take it at the first sign of 'tingling' the sore simply does not form. If however, I wait until the sore had already formed it the DGL only shortens the duration to 1 wk (canker sores usually last 2 wks with me). If the canker sore is already 'in full swing' nothing will help.I've tried many other remedies in the past both conventional and alternative (one such on the alternative side was swishing with colloidal silver which I gave up when I found out about the dangers associated with its use). This has proven to be for be the most effective and efficient.If taken on time, Natural Factors Chewable DGL is in my opinion the BEST product out there for canker sores."

Kind of a silly premise which I wasn't aware of when I bought it, and it doesn't work anyway. The heating pad gets so hot so quickly that you can't leave it on long enough to sweat. The result is no moist heat...just heat. As a safety feature you have to hold the control on at all times. OK I guess, but it's a pain.

I have been on the phone many times with the owner and their customer service cannot be beat, but the software just doesn't work. If you want to just use this as a portable tool and don't mind manually adding what is not there, this is great; just like using a PDA. It certainly is a great idea and helps to track what you are consuming and keep on track with your diet.I have decided to try a different counter, which I am hoping the software will work and I can use more efficiently."

Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months.

By the first three strikes of the chimes to begin meditation, a spirit of calm and mystery is evoked that enables one to enter into the always rich experience of meditation. This timer is so easy to use and turns itself off as the final chimes are struck softly to end the meditation experience. It is well made and durable. The real wood exterior accents any room and there is a volume adjustment for sound control of chimes. The price is excellent for a timer of this quality and reliability. Highly recommended for everyone!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"The unpleasant smell and greasy appearance were apparent as soon as the can was opened. The caution to not overcook was too late; it already bordered on mush. The vegetables had lost their colors and texture. I didn't know an unground garbonza could be mushy, but they were. It was difficult to imagine why a no-meat soup was SO greasy, and even more difficult to understand why veggie-bean soup needed any kind of vinegar, and this stuff was loaded with the Balsamic variety. I managed to eat 3 spoonfuls before tossing the rest. I will never again subject myself to Amy's GROTESQUE SOUP. I give this a one-star rating because the system will not accept a no-star rating."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"i purchased this pump before my son was born (eight months ago)...i wanted to get a medela, but couldn't rationalize the higher price. i knew i would only be pumping a few times a day at most, so i thought i'd give lansinoh a try (loved their bags and creams). at any rate, there were several weeks when i did have to pump around the clock (unrelated breastfeeding issues), and this pump handled the job well. in fact, at one point i thought one side was pumping faster than the other, so i called the company to complain. they overnighted me (at no cost to me) a new pump to use. overall, their customer service has been wonderful! i used this pump on average about two to three times a day for six months and it is still kicking. i've never seen another pump, so i'm not sure how loud it is comparatively, but for the cheaper price, i was fine with it."

She actually liked this chair better than her home chair during her 5th and 6th months. It folks super flat and is lightweight. It also telescoped up and down to adjust for heights. It was easy to install. I'm not sure I'd use it everyday b/c of the wide base and lack of ability to turn it. At my house we use a Bloom Fresco chair."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I discovered this product a couple of years ago at a natural foods store, but in a much larger bag. It's a nice light treat when you want something sweet -- like Crackerjacks for grownups. It's not exactly a healthy food, but certainly much better for you than a lot of sweet snacks. I appreciate being able to order it in a smaller bag, which curbs the temptation to keep munching out of the large size package."

I have never liked the wooden highchairs at restaurants as they are usually broken and my baby finds them uncomfortable.And while visiting friends or family we used to have to hold him in our lap while we eat (as most of our friends don't have loaner highchairs for us). This booster seat is wonderful.We just got it this weekend, we were visiting some friends in another state. We used it in several restaurants, it was super easy to use and we used it on many different kinds of chairs. The padding makes it really comfortable and the straps that secure it to the chairs work really well.At our friends house it was nice to have a special sitting spot for him, without a bulky highchair.The chair folds up small and I could easily carry the baby, the diaper bag and the chair with out feeling too bogged down.Two thumbs up!"

If you buy it, consider it ""disposable""."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a wonderful combination of vitamins and herbs that really helps when I feel a cold coming on. The beauty of amazon is that I was able to buy it in Michigan and send it to my daughter in Florida when she was feeling sick. Which is funny because when she lived at home, she would fight me to take them (but she took them). Then she went off to school and the first thing she asked for when she was feeling sick was the wellness formula. They are a little hard to get past the nose (I just plug my nose), but they work wonders. One might say ""miraculous"". They also have a liquid elixir that is good in orange juice, well let's not say ""good"" but palatable. I would not be well without them."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"I purchased this product today from TJ Maxx. They just got it in, and it was only $5.99 so I thought I'd give it a try. It was a bit too sweet and it tasted of almond extract instead of the natural gentle taste of real almonds. My sister in law always brings the most delightful marzipan from Peru when she visits. I hoped that this marzipan would be similar, but it wasn't. Although it wasn't perfect, it was still good. Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't throw it in the trash--I nibbled until I ate the whole box. It's also true that the fruit shapes are only painted on top--it's flat on the back."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"It's so hard to find healthy noodle bowls-- and the Annie Chun's Noodle Express line does a great job of providing good flavor without scary nutrition information. Each tray is a little over 300 calories, compared to 500+ for a traditional ramen-type meal of the same size. I keep these at work in case I don't have time to make my lunch, and don't feel guilty at all when I eat them. Not everybody needs to watch nutritional information, but for those of us that do, it's a really convenient product.The sauce & seasoning packet are about what I would normally expect from a comparable product, but the steamed noodles really make this a great change from the rest."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Prilosec is the oldest of the Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) on the market. So, it has a loooooong history, and to my knowledge a safe history. As for me, I take comfort in a drug that has a long safe history, and that is why I like Prilosec. Also, for me, the side effects occurred in the first few days, but then wore off. I still have minor gas problems, but there may be an anti-gas OTC drug available for that, I don't know yet. One thing I learned is that it is helpful to know the differences between an Antacid (e..g. Tums, Rolaids, etc.), a PPI (e.g. Prilosec, the actual drug name being ""omeprazolel"") and an H2 blocker (e.g. Pepcid, the actual drug name being ""famotidine""). All three work differently from each other and have different side effects. A pharmacist or your doctor should be able to tell you the differences. All I know is that an antacid is simply a huge dose of calcium carbonate that works immediately to reduce the acid already in the stomach. That is why you feel immediate relief, albeit one which lasts only one or two hours; and come 4 am you feel the bottom of your esophagus on fire again. PPIs and H2 blockers instead go through your bloodstream and eventually (that is why it takes much more time than an antacid) alter the acid producing mechanisms (pumps?) in your stomach. I have Barrett's Esophagus (loosely defined as a more advanced condition of GERD), and my understanding is that PPIs are better for this condition. The point is, if you know more about your condition and the differences between Antacids, PPIs and H2 blockers, you will save yourself an immense amount of trouble and time. For example, if you find a PPI such as Prilosec ain't working for you, then it will probably be the case that other PPIs are not going to work for you either, since their base chemical formulation works in a similar way. Ergo, switch to an H2 blocker and see what happens. If both PPIs and H2 blockers give you unbearable side effects, then you probably have to go through the entire laundry list of PPIs and H2 blockers out there. Good luck."

I read about sound machines and researched many of them. This one had good reviews and wasn't too expensive. It looks like some kind of flying saucer, but does exactly what I want it to - that odd front grill is actually the volume. You can either set the 60-minute timer, or just leave the sound on until it's turned off. There are enough sounds to choose from that we easily found one that agreed with us both.

Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months. My bench went from 215 pounds to 450, body fat from 7% to 3%, and mile time from 6 minutes to 5. It works.Here are the quick basics, although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out, you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking, or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine, 5-10 grams of glutamine, and a multi-anti-oxidant formula. All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital:Step One:Blend 1/3 protein (experiment to find the exact number for you), 1/3 dextrose (simple sugar), and 1/3 maltodextrin (complex sugar) with enough water (water should be at least 92% of the total mixture). Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.Shake the ingredients well. Put creatine powder in your mouth (5-10 grams when starting, 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine) and drink the shake to wash the creatine down. It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water, as that makes creatine lose its potency.Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out. After this 5 minutes, allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2:After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes, consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin with one gulp of the shake.Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period. This allows for maximum absorption rate of the nutrients into your body."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Source Naturals Life Force Multiple is the best multi-vitamin and mineral on the market. I used to sell high-end supplements when I was 18, and I quit the ""top"" company as soon as I learned about Life Force. Life Force is rated top five in the supposedly neutral Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements, although I believe the rating was skewed towards that company I used to work for. In either case, Life Force was just as good as the number one supplement I used to sell, and it was one-third the cost.

It's now the only oil product I will use for my hair. It's also very good moisturizer for the skin, too.

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,I have seen several complain about OVwatch's customer service. Add me to the list of unsatisfied customers. Many times I felt as if they couldn't wait to get me off the phone. The first month it predicted that I had my fertile time when I didn't. I didn't Ovulate for another week. The second month my sensor was dried out so I had to use my last one on month 2. Thats when my watch started malfunctioning. I called the company again with little help. They just kept sending me sensors when it was clear there was something wrong with the watch. This caused great agravation and I had to take a 3 month ttc break. We used the Answer OPKs and after 4 years of ttc we are pregnant. The watch never worked after month 1. And CS wasn't a bit of help. They should have had me return the watch and fix it or something but that was alot of money to spend without getting pregnant in return. Thank you OV watch for so much heartbreak. I know the watch works but in my case I got one that malfunctioned and your CS people didn't do their job correctly and now I am out alot of money and I very angry with how I was treated. Thank you Answer opks for my beautiful baby girl!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Its not a magic pill but if your dieting properly and exercising this is a great supplement to assist in burning fat as energy. Its a non-stimulant so you wont feel any added energy from it but since your cells are water based fat cells can't travel into the cell to be burned for energy. L-Carnitine is water soluble so it attaches itself to a fat molecule and passes it through the cell wall which can then be used as fuel. Other than that the only muscle in the body that burns fat exclusively as a source of energy is the heart. Hence, target heart rate during cardio and thermogenic fat burners which speed up your heart rate.I take 3 tablets a day and follow a strict exercise and diet program."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Personnaly speaking Raspberry is not very good, but I can't complain.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is really good in coffee. I bought several flavors from the Capella company, and this is my favorite so far. For a 12 oz cup of coffee, I put in 9 drops, which worked out very well. I also added about a teaspoon of Wholesome Zero sweetner (awesome stuff). It probably doesn't need any sweetner at all.FYI - this tastes NASTY if you try it straight. It's kind of like cough syrup, but worse. The same thing happens if you try Vanilla straight, though, so I wasn't too worried after I first opened it. Once it's been dissolved in enough coffee, it tastes like it smells, which is wonderful. And there's no sugar or calories.I haven't tried this disolved in water. There are instructions for it, but I think Egg Nog flavored water would be weird since plain Egg Nog should have a creamy texture to it. A fruity flavor might be better.This would be awesome in milk shakes.I usually buy flavored coffee (whole bean), but I think I'm going to keep investing in this and just buy regular plain coffee. That way I can have any flavor I want without having to store several pounds of expensive coffee."

They are a good thing to take on the road and have in between meals or before dinner on the way home from work so you are not ravenous when you hit home and feel like eating everything in sight! The only thing I would say is a negative is that one serving has 25g of sugar, which is a little high for me and my nutrition goals. Other than, that I highly recommend it!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We're very happy with this high chair. Like other reviewers, I agree that it is extremely easy to clean - just wipe the main chair with a cloth, and the tray is just 2 pieces which are also easy to wipe, or wash in the sink. Unfortunately, the chair is on carpet in our apartment, and so doesn't rotate or lift as easily as if on a hard floor, but that hasn't been a huge problem.It is very compact and small, and fits in nicely with our small table. I like that it can be pushed right up to the table, with the base fitting underneath the table.A drawback to this compact design is the small tray - our bowl just barely fits on it. Sometimes our baby reaches for the bowl and I have to hold it instead. Whereas, with other high chairs, the tray has been large enough that we can just move the bowl out of the way.We started using it when our baby was 6 months old, and she had no problems fitting in it, or sitting in it. The straps are easily adjustable.I would highly recommend this chair."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Outstanding. Have been testing alot of Gluten free flours. This is by far the best I have found.

This item has a thoughtful design, including a pass-thru plug (2 prong) and nightlight, and the innovative addition of an air ionizer that made placing this in a bathroom or closet a multi-purpose solution.When I first plugged the unit into my downstairs bathroom outlet, my 2 cats 30 feet away in the living room started to growl and ran upstairs. My child came downstairs shortly afterward complaining about the painful warbling sound coming from downstairs. Apparently the ultrasonic frequency is outside of adult hearing, but adoloscent ears have a hammer and anvil response range beyond that of adults (until they're done growing, and the body loses flexibility, such as when the bones start to harden). I further tested the unit in the garage and an upstairs closet, but found the results were the same for both cats and family.I am unsure of how pests respond to this unit, but it definitely repelled my cats and child, forcing me to discontinued use of the product."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,I ordered the Master Massage Adjustable Stool because I cannot stand for any amount of time without severe back pains. This meant our dinner fare was limited to frozen dinners that you get sick of very soon. With the stool I can prepare dinners that require time to assemble and cook. I can now make all those old favorites we missed because of my back. I bless this stool every dinner time.[[ASIN:B000E24IZM Adjustable Rolling Massage Stool))

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"These packets are convenient and easy, a couple of spoons, 1/2 cup water mix and your are ready to go. The honey butter taste is subtle, I usually like butter and jam on my biscuits but did not need any to supplement the flavor.I have used boxed bisquick for years, for whatever reason, these packets mix easier and are moister than using the standard bisquick recipie."
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,They are great! I just got mine and I LOVE them! The only down side is that you can not put them in the washing machine.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Excellent product. Recommend highly. Does just what it's suppose to do (give great feet and calf massages) Another added plus is that the product arrived much quicker than expected.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had asthma bad at one time being hospitalized at least 3 to 4 times a year. All the meds they prescribed helped in the short term, but had many bad side effects. I use to feel like it was worth the risk when the alternative certainly meant a hospital visit and sometimes for days.After doing deeper research on the internet I found that Advair had been linked to asthma fatalities. Now there's a side effect I could do without. I also suffered from chest pains and nervousness.I didn't use Quercetin in place of asthma meds, but included it after reading about it's anti-inflamatory properties. Over time I took asthma meds less and kept with the Quercetin.It's been years since I've taken any traditional asthma meds and I haven't been in the hospital for asthma attacks since. I didn't notice when, but the chest pains are gone and my hand held out is as solid as a rock.As other products I use from Now Foods, I find their products to be of the highest quality and this gets you the best results. I try to get anyone who has asthma to at least try Quercetin to get off the prescription meds."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I've used Avent for a decade, since the birth of my first child. Baby #4 is now being introduced to the bottle for when I have to go back to work, and so far, he hates the choices thus far (Breastflow & Avent's Tempo). He doesn't like any pacifier either, so obviously it's a breast vs. bottle thing going on.Anyway...As I was saying, I've used Avent products for years (the Isis Duo electric pump *rocks*, as does the handheld manual) without difficulty. Clean-up, easy and I've never needed a bottle brush due to the wide nipple (my pinky tip fits in), and the wide bottle. I've had occasional ""leaks"" from the bottle, (the older Avent nurser model); this bottle hasn't leaked at all. Generally the leaks (nurser-style or regular bottle) were due to user-error (the cap not twisted on properly kind of thing). As with any bottle, one has to be certain all the parts are on properly.However... The reason why I'm docking Tempo is due to the fact that it does not fit Avent's breast pump attachments. The extremely expensive pump I bought (in 2005 when the Isis Duo first came out) requires me to use either the Avent bottles or the older style nurser bottle with a Lansinoh storage bag (which I'd *almost* thrown out, the older bottle, not the fabulous storage bags). What's up with this??? Why have a product that doesn't integrate with one of the most important aspects of baby feeding?(And if anyone out there knows of a way to fit the Tempo to the Isis pump, I would *love* to hear it.)Other than that, if you are contemplating whether to purchase this product or not, it does the job, is relatively inexpensive (compared to Born Free, Adiri, etc.), and providing your baby takes to it, I'd say go ahead. :-)"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I've been using this pad for years, and it is a fabulous product. I often have neck stiffness and headaches in the morning, and for all but the worst bouts 20 minutes with this makes me good as new. I do find, however, that with regular use it needs to be replaced every year. While it will still get hot, there won't be as much moisture, and the smell will become more noticeable and begin to cling to clothes. Time to replace! I've tried other, similar brands, but this one is the best at holding the heat."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Green, black and white peppercorns grow like tiny grapes on the Piper Nigrum vine. Green peppercorns are picked when under-ripe. White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.Tellicherry peppercorns are superior to regular store bought peppercorns. They are spicier, enhance the flavor of all your recipes and can take things up a notch. Of course, there are still recipes where you don't want the intensity of Tellicherry peppercorns, but after you taste the freshly ground flavor, it is difficult to go back to using anything else.I find myself grinding the peppercorns over scrambled eggs and sprinkling them liberally over salads and pasta. I now use the peppercorns in nearly every soup recipe.Make the change and you will never be able to go back to regular ground pepper. You may laugh, but there are some of us who fear the thought of regular pepper.Fun Fact"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,The only thing this did for me was possibly increase my blood pressure. I noticed my ears getting hot and that's about it. Nothing happenned to show a possible increase in testosterone levels.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"To me this tea has the perfect blend of black tea, spices and a subtle orange flavor. A little bit of sugar or artificial sweetener really brings out the flavors. I keep about a dozen types of tea at home and six or seven at work. While I enjoy the others, I go through boxes of this tea before I go through a box of any of the others. This is just the best and the Amazon price is excellent.I'll also second another reviewers comment; if you are ever in Boulder Colorado don't miss the factory tour. The mint room is a real eye opener."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"Upon opening the product, I tested the massage function and it worked great. Lots of good attachments that really loosened up my shoulder immediately. However, as soon as I put the heating attachment on, the plastic rim around it started to crack and fall off. And not just a tiny bit, but the entire ring. I thought I had used the product incorrectly, but re-read the instructions front to back and found that I had followed them to the letter. In fact, there was a blurb about NEVER using the heating attachment if the plastic ring cracks or falls off. So I'm not sure if that was included because this is something that happens regularly or what, but needless to say I was very disappointed. Again, I hope this is the exception and not the rule. All of the other reviews seem pretty positive which is why I was so disappointed."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have tried different flavors for my senseo and for it is the cappucino I like best. For me it is frothy enough hot cold add millk or not, I am just more satisfied to wind down with a good cup."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This neem leaf extract is very good. Originally when I purchased it I was thinking it was an oil, but it is actually a water-based extract. I mix it with a little unscented lotion and apply it as a topical skin treatment. The scent of it is also not as strong as I imagined it to be, which is great considering that neem is not the most fragrant odor!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I had used this product from the health food store but they discontinued carrying it. Well what do you do then, of course Amazon.com. It arrived in a very short time and it tastes good. I use it with 2% milk so it creamy and good. I recommend it as a diet supplement."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I have a hard time finding this zinger in stores. I was only able to obtain a few bags as part of a sampler. I found myself buying the sampler specifically for the tangerine-orange zinger(other flavors good too). The taste is simply great and it is easily my favorite tea. Highly recommend! Get a great deal through amazon.com and enjoy!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is a great decaffinated tea. It's very hard to find in the stores so I was happy to find it online. This seller sent it in a box, neatly packed. It took a bit longer than I would have wanted, but I think that was because of the holidays. Snow and all - overall, quite happy with quality and delivery of product."

I followed the instructions to the letter but three days after completing the regimen the reflux was back as bad as ever. I have absolutely no symptoms when I take the Omeprazole daily. My doctor recommended I try it so I thought it would be worth a try.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I received a different pump at my baby shower and couldn't get a drop of milk. I thought it was me. I then ordered this pump after using the manual pump provided by the hospital..which was a real workout. This pump is AMAZING. I nursed for 3 months and pumped for 6. I have 10.5 cubit feet of freezer space filled with milk. And the pump is still going strong. I just passed it on to my sister, in fact. I'm so thankful for this pump. It comes with a nice nylon bag and takes 4 AA batteries for on the go. Which is amazing because I once left on vacation without the AC adapter. Wonderful product."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,cheese,4.0,"This product arrived in a timely manner, well packed & in good condition.The pamphlet does say the cheese should be quite safe to consume even after a couple of days 'at room temperature'. Here a temp range should be provided.With the aid of the package tracking feature it should be possible to take a guess at how long a shipment may have been without proper cooling and whether or not that is a factor to you.Lovely product, strong & distinctive.Was much less pricey--including the S & H-- from IGourmet than any of our local vendors. We do intend to order from IGourmet again."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,oils,4.0,"I've tried a number of different flavors and found the Bleu Cheese and Vinaigrette more suited to my taste. Nothing I've tried of these dressings really tastes like normal salad dressing, but these make terrific alternatives if you're looking for a dressing that minimizes caloric intake. The Vinaigrette also has made a good ""dipping"" dressing for bread, etc. Just try a few and see which ones you like."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"I have read the directions multiple times and have attempted to take the temperature of multiple people many many times. First, you never get remotely the same temperature reading twice. Also, it seems to always read lower than the actual temperature. I really don't understand how anyone can get a reliable reading from this device. Perhaps mine is defective???Anyway, I will stick to my Braun Thermoscan ear thermometer, which is the most accurate thermometer that I've come across. This worthless thing will go in the garbage."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Since I started taking this product 4 years ago, I have not been sick, not even a cold. I take it religiously every morning when I first get up, there is no doubt that it works. This is the best multiple vitamin you can take, and it works."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,2.0,"Fast shipment! Product was not packaged like original order, 50 to a package, they were loose in the box, making it difficult to determine the total quanity. They were beige, not blue like the picture or like previous orders. The new price of product was 3 times more than before (14.95 to 41.00).$35 shipping cost was also ridiculous!! Would have waited a week or so for slower deliver if less expensive shipping was an option. I may not re-order in the future."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Excellent for pancakes and baking. I have tried almost all the recipes on the bag and they all taste great!
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I really enjoy this muesli, so much that I have sent packages to my family members and friends. It's definitely more interesting that oatmeal, which was my previous breakfast staple, and after comparing nutritional information, I think this is the better way to go. I also made cookies with this, which turned out pretty well - I'll have to tinker with that recipe to get it perfect. I think buying it on Amazon.com is the best value, compared with grocery store prices."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Me and my wife were looking for a heating pad and this was the right one. Gives off good heat and is digitally adjustable.

baby products,feeding,food,3.0,"I bought this because my 2 sister-in-laws swore by it...but my son never really took to it & by the time he did, he was eating fruit in pieces anyway. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, unless a hot summer would make this a good product...I put ice cubes in this while my son was teething, but he was more fascinated with an ice cube sitting in front of him then with chewing on this. good idea but just was very useful for my son"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,My daughter told me about this product and a search found it on Amazon. I had used hers and it is the best stuff ever and I have tried everything. It does not prevent a cold sore but if you use it at first tingle it lessens the outbreak to a minimum. I will never be without it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My doctor wants me to take 3600mg of omega 3 oil daily, but there is NO WAY I can swallow one of those big capsules and most liquid forms make me ill. Coromega to the rescue. It tastes great, slides down easily (or mixes well with just about anything). My doctor didn't know about it - but he does now, and recommends it to all his patients who have trouble with the large capsules."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"I love this product - it's been a lifesaver for our household, as our 1-year old twins love to walk around the house with snacks, or take them in the car/stroller with them. They have figured out, however, how to hold open a portion of the lid while shaking snacks out - so it doesn't entirely contain the snacks, but it's much better than giving them an open container of cheerios, which they are bound to dump on the floor."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"All the products on this recent order are working just fine, I recieved all products except one quickly.What does not work good is your farmed out customer service. There was a problem/mix up on the home theater system I ordered. I called your costomer service to inquire and the two people I spoke to in India spoke to fast and I could not hear them well even after repeatly asking them to speak louder and slower. I finally ended up hanging up on that call. Then I called a second coustomer service and got a nice gentleman in Coasta Rica who's english was good, I could hear him well, but all he wanted to do was refund my money.He did finally file a complaint/claim. Since this home theater was a ""B"" model and the last one at a good price I didn't want my money back I wanted the product and I needed it before Xmas as we had many guests.So, it might be a good idea to test/screen potential coustmer service employees for speed and volume when speaking before hiring them.Thank you"

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"I like the fact that this nightguard is soft and pliable. I find that it is comfortable to wear, night or day, even compared to the extremely expensive ""custom"" ones that I get from the dentist. But soon I was finding it on my pillow every night. In fact, it didn't stay in very long at all. I got the low profile because my mouth is small. It doesn't need to be boiled, but it is adjustable by moving the vinyl platforms back or forward in the notches. I still think that, for $30, it is worth a try, since other people have had good luck with it. This is a infinitesimal fraction of what I have paid out to dentists in my life, and I still have Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction!Good Luck!"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I like my little mister, but wish it would put out more fragrance. It is very faint. I don't recommend this for a big room, a small bathroom or bedroom perhaps would be ok. Also put it close by to where you're sitting if you want to enjoy the aroma if you use essential oil in the mister. I do love the fact that it changes color, that's really nice."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I recently purchase a mixed pack of Carr's crackers on sale. The whole wheat was the one that disappeared first. It's slighty sweet yet has a salty taste, too. The texture is biscuit-like with whole grain goodness. This is a cracker that is all purpose and would be a good cookie substitute. I also think that children would like them."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Great vibrant colors, easy to use and the tips are very sturdy too and hold up to the abuse of being used on sugar cookies.I love these!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have tried a lot of different protein shakes from a lot of manufacturers. Most of them are ok when had with milk or soy milk, but not that good when had with plain water. After a strenous workout, the best way have to have a protein shake is with water, since that is the fastest delivery mechanism.The fruit blast protein shake, is a whey isolate, which means its absorbed faster than plain whey protein by the body. It mixes pretty well with water and tastes pretty good too. I have been using this product for the last 3-4 months and feel its a great bargain for the price."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I love this product! Its so thin it is hardly noticeable and yet it is very strong.My father's skin is so thin that it literally tears. This dressing covers the tear like a second skin to let it heal and because it *is* so thin, it doesn't bother him enough that he feels he has to remove it!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,So far it is working great. When I told people I was shopping for a pump - everyone told me to rent one which was very expensive or buy a Medela which costs around 300 dollars. Both would have cost 3 times what I paid for this pump. I've only had it for 1 month and use it 2-3 times a day. My hope is that it will stay working good & last me another 2-3 months just until I am back at work and am done breastfeeding... we'll have to wait and see on that one.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This thing is great, it really gets the knots out of the back and feels great on your neck. Very quiet but does make a bit of vibrating noise sometimes. This unit is worth the money. The long cord is nice to have. Haven't messed with the heater much, the directions say it can take 10+ mins to get to temp."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love this vitamin. I can tell it's doing positive things on the inside because my finger nails are growing and I have more energy. Choosing a vitamin is like choosing the right fitness program, it's an individual thing based on each person's needs and body. There is not one perfect vitamin for the entire world, but I know based on how my body responds, that this one is good for me. Pay attention to your own body. Choose a good quality, whold food vitamin and read reviews on the product. A good source to read reviews is [..]. I have nothing to do with them, but I find their information helpful."

I'm an avid Basketball player and I haven't had pain on the court since."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"What I love best is that each individual package of oatmeal is equivalent to two bags of other brands. It's organic and lower in sugar. If you or your kids have a sweet tooth this oatmeal may be a bit bland. I add a wee bit of maple syrup to each serving, otherwise my daughter (age 5) will not eat it."

I'm pretty much addicted and want to make my own with out spending more than what I buy at the coffee shop i go to. I go there so often, the owner knows that i want ""the usual"". Peach is my favorite flavor. I've tried green apple and mango; green apple was good but mango tasted very weird. Peach is the besttt!!! (in my opinion) Never picked another... I am sooo addicted too!! and I hope I can make money to buy a whole crate of it. xD"

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"The lamp was received in five days which was just fine for the free shipping. The condition of the packing and the lamp itself was great. Assembly of the lamp was simple. The upright legs were not very heavy duty but do work. I have been diagnoised with SAD and am taking medication for it. As I really do not like to take any medication, the possibility of the use of a lamp for reducing SAD naturally seemed like a reasonable option. My wife claims that the daily exposure of 20 to 30 minutes really seem to improve my mood and attitude. Although the directions suggested using the lamp in the morning, I have found it just as effective to use the lamp in the late afternoon or early evening."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,3.0,"At the current price of $42.99, this costs much more than any retail store that I've ever seen this in for about $3.58 per bottle. The highest price I've seen this bottle for is $2.99 although I'm sure it may be available for more in a marked up retail store. (From my experience though, these stores usually sell only the smaller sizes.) I regular shop for and purchase this bottle (separately and not in a case) at about $2.00 to $2.25 each on average. What gives?"

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"I am not going to write a long review of this product, suffice it to say that it has certain good points and bad points:The good:- I like the overall engineering of the product. For its size, it cranks out a ton of light (it has three 36w bulbs inside). You can stand it up on a table using the flip stand on the back, or you can attach the legs to raise it up. It is also very compact, visually appealing, and solidly built.The bad:- As others have commented, this light exudes the smell of burning plastic, no doubt because the back gets so incredibly hot. This smell fills the room and wafts throughout the house and is hard to get rid of. It has not abated at all in the week or so that I have been using this light, and it pretty objectionable.- It uses 4000k bulbs and as a result casts a slightly warm yellowish light that does not really resemble sunlight. I know that recent studies have shown that light intensity may be more important than color temperature, but since the manufacturer has designed this light so that you are to work, read, etc directly under it, the 4000k bulbs give pretty poor color rendition. When you compare this light side by side to a one that uses higher color temperature bulbs, you really see how yellow it is. I can't understand why the manufacturer chose 4000k bulbs, but I personally prefer light that ""looks"" more like natural sunlight...i.e. in the 5000k+ range and there are other boxes that do this (like the UltraLux). On a dreary winter day 5000k+ light really feels like natural sunlight. Not so with this box unfortunately, though it may still be therapeutic.Overall although I like the design, high output, looks and portability, I would not purchase one of these again. The nasty smell and lack of daylight spectrum bulbs detract too much from the product as a whole. I should have given it two stars, but I seem to be unable to go back and edit that field."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"OK, where do I start? Clif Bar is a company located in Berkeley, California, that specializes in foods for people on the go, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The ZBaR is made with all-organic non-genetically engineered ingredients with no trans fat, no high-fructose corn syrup. Even the packaging is made with non-toxic inks on foil (not plastic) wrapping, and packed in a recycled cardboard box.So, this is really a good product. It tastes great, chewy and sweet with the firm chocolate chips providing a delicious counterpoint to the whole grain bar. My kids love it, and I feel good about it and the sustainable philosophy of the company. Like I said, a good product - good to eat, good for you, good for the planet.(Review of CLIF Kid ZBaR, 1.27-Ounce Bars)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"These bars taste pretty all right. The main part, which is chewy and smooth in texture, is topped by a layer of ""caramel"" with peanut bits, and the whole thing is covered in ""chocolate"". The chocolate doesn't taste like real chocolate (it doesn't taste much like anything, but it holds the bar together and looks like candy). But the caramel does taste like real caramel and has a similar texture.Because they are high in protein, the bars are also quite filling. I usually eat one when I leave work, so that I don't feel hungry right when I get home, and can take the time to cook a real dinner.Some things to watch out for"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"We found this product after searching for an as-natural-as-possible form of coconut water as we could - for my wife).She has bought several cartons to-date (in Jan 2009), and thinks the product is commendable. (If she continues with something it has to be good).I've tasted a few of these drinks, and do agree with her that they don't taste perfect (due to the preservation process) but are good enough, and they definitely beat the typical cans of simmilar product that are commonly available on the store shelves.(I should know a good coconut, my dad grew and sold thousands of these ""Jellies"" as we called them, when I was a child - so we tasted our share or real-fresh-good coconut water etc).Byron"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.

But with this item the results were dreadful.Now I make a 6oz cup and it's STILL bad.I don't understand why others seem to like this coffee. Did I get a bad batch? I don't know.For comparison, I like Cafejo Adrenaline Explosion for my Senseo. So far I haven't found it for the Keurig."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I was given a twin pack of this sauce from a friend. I had heard about it and seen it at Costco but never tried it. Wow, was I in for a treat, this stuff is great! It packs just enough of a bite to really bring out the zing. So far, I have tried it on just about anything you can imagine. I now use it as a substitute to my steak sauce- instead of the old Heinz 57 I now use this sauce. I experimented and put a little on top of a plate of pasta and tomate meat sauce- awesome! Try a bunch over softened cream cheese and crackers! I now use it on fish tacos and its perfect. Please discount the ONE negative review by someone complaining about the raspberry seeds being left in- gimme a break! You hardly notice them and its no big deal at all- you know this was made with real berries!"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"I purchased this item from the sellers ""fastfriendlyservice"" because they offered the lowest price for this particular model of ear themometer. But, they ended up sending me a completely differently model by the same brand (Homedics). I had to use the thermometer immediately, and did not return it, but left feedback on Amazon about how ""fastfriendlyservice"" sent me the wrong item without explanation.Well, upon reading my review (which was a fair/neutral, 3 out of 5), ""fastfriendlyservice"" shot me off and email saying that had I not used the thermometer, I could have returned it to them for a refund... AND NOW they would give me a $15 Amazon credit if I removed my neutral feedback and replace it with positive feedback... detailing instructions on how I could do this for them. I responded with a simple ""NO THANK YOU."" To this they further replied by email, now bribing me with a $20 credit?!? How unethical is THAT?!? So, their ""positive"" feedback history is probably BOGUS. Now I know.So, if you're interested in this item... HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET A DIFFEReNT HOMEDICS MODEL FOR $20 OFF, HUH?"

I won't say it tastes better than Turtle Island brand, but it's definitely a lot cheaper. It cost about half the price of the other brand, but it taste just as good as the other brand. I'll definitely buy it again. Thank you for the reviews."

I had to buyTwinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)once because my grocer was out of this tea. I found I preferred the English tea, its strong too but a little smoother. The Irish tea, to me, has a slight metallic taste. But I still enjoy it. Then my wife picked upBigelow Vanilla Chai Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)and WOW, that is now my favorite. But, try this tea, its strong and has a great flavor. But don't be afraid to try other teas by quality tea companies like Bigelow and Twinings."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"initially excited about this product. Must say after 1st use, I haven't used it again. It's cumbersome to use because it's heavy to carry after filling it with water. I do like the fact that the water continues to be heated. One of the things I originally liked was the pumice stone. But it's in a position, where you have to take your foot out of the water to use and even then it's not that effective. So if your primary objective is to use it for exfoliating, it's not very good at that."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I enjoyed the taste of this roasted Raspberry chipotle sauce. I was impressed with the real raspberry flavor and think this would go well on chicken, meat, or other grilled dishes. Because I have heartburn, I did find the chipotle a bit strong for me, so I don't think I would eat this often. Perhaps if there was a mild version it would be something I would consume more. Overall, this was a great product, I recommend for both BBQ enthusiasts and those who like the combo of fruit sauce with their meat.5 stars."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"Reviewing a food product is always difficult since different people have different likes and dislikes for various flavors. As such, I will try to keep this review as objective as possible.With a name like 'Roasted Raspberry Chipotle', you get an expectation of heat, sweetness and smokiness. This sauce delivers all three of these elements fairly well. My initial impression of the sauce was one of a sweet sauce, followed by some spiciness and finished by some smoke. The spice from the jalape&ntilde;os is not overbearing...it is pleasantly spicy. If you are used to chipotles in adobo sauce, you will find this sauce to be rather mild by comparison. When paired with food, the spicy and smokey elements seem to diminish, leaving you with a sweet raspberry sauce.The sauce itself seems to be a raspberry puree or mash, with raspberry seeds intact. I did not see any noticable chunks of jalape&ntilde;o. The sauce appears fresh and smells much like it tastes...smokey, sweet and spicy.It should be noted that this product doesn't exactly use chipotles. A chipotle is is a smoke-dried jalape&ntilde;o chili. Reading the ingredient list of the Razzpotle product, we find that the main ingredient is sugar, followed by jalape&ntilde;os. One of the final ingredients in the list is ""smoke flavor"". So by reading the label, we can infer that this product doesn't really use chipotles...it uses jalape&ntilde;os and some liquid smoke to simulate the taste of a real chipotle. Having said that, the sauce does a pretty good job of delivering the taste of a chipotle.Overall, I found the sauce to be a bit too sweet. I would prefer to cut the sugar and turn up the heat...but this is probably a matter of personal preference. Quality wise, this sauce is of high general quality. If you like the concept of a combination of sweet, spicy and smokey, you should give this sauce a shot."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"This Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce is really good. The sweetness of the raspberries, the spiciness of the peppers (both jalapenos and chipolte are listed as ingredients), and the smoke flavoring make an outstanding combination together.The sauce does have raspberry seeds in it...if that bothers you, you can always pull out a strainer and get rid of them. The sauce is good on Bar-B-Que meat, but should be spread on when the meat is almost done. If it's put on too early, the sugar will burn and you'll end up with a charred mess. It can also be used as is, poured over a block of cream cheese and served as an appetizer with crackers. I recommend regular cream cheese, rather than the low-fat variety, as the fat tones down the spiciness a bit. The neck tag on the bottle also suggests adding it to a balsamic vinegar salad dressing. I haven't used it that way (yet), but imagine that it would be pretty good."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce is just the thing to wake up a salad and does wonders for meat salads like turkey or ham! The first whiff gave me the impression of barbeque sauce, but this isn't barbeque sauce! The first taste made me think ""sweet French dressing,"" but then the peppers and raspberries kick in and yikes!I tried it with plain, cut-up apples and it was great as a dip. I put it on a fresh green salad and it was wonderful as a salad dressing. Add diced turkey or ham to the salad, and it's better than anything you'll get in a restaurant.I'm impressed! I'm not ready to put it on my chocolate cake yet, but as a versatile dressing and dip, I'm all over it! A heads up to anyone who suffers with GERD...be careful with this one. This spicy, seedy, tangy sauce will give new meaning to the word ""heartburn."""

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,3.0,"So I'm a self-professed chili head-- the kind of person who will find a hot sauce to put on ice cream (Toad Sweat if you're curious) and who makes it a habit to challenge places that think they make incredibly hot wings to knock me over. When I see specialty products like this Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, I'm generally inclined to check them out.What I found was a sauce that, while it was tasty, with a nice sweetness to it, was a bit overwhelming in the smokey department and a bit underwhelming in the spice department. Made primarily of raspberries, pickled jalapenos and chipotles, the sauce smells so strongly of smoke, I was initially a bit put off. But a little on a cracker and I found a very natural tasting raspberry flavor blended with the smokiness, with a slight spice kick in the aftertaste. What I didn't detect, much to my disappointment, was much in the way of spiciness or a peppery taste to it. After a few more crackers, I began finding the taste of smoke a bit overwhelming.I find it kind of confusing that such a specialty product didn't cater to the spicy food crowd, and while the product was ok, the overly assertive smokiness of it got a bit in the way. It's not a terrible product by any means, but it's not going to knock you over either."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Bought this for my husband, who uses a heating pad every night on his back. Good quality, normal width and king in length.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We purchased this when our daughter was six months old to keep at grandma's house. We already had the fisher price space saver at home, and thought this would be very similar. It works great. Grandma can keep it in the closet when we aren't visiting, and it takes up no space. Plus it will continue to grow with our daughter. She loves the polka dot pattern on the seat, and spends a lot of her time in the chair turning around to touch the spots! My only complaint would be that the seat can recline, but the tray doesn't move. For six months and up, this hasn't been a problem, but for grandchild #2 we will have to see if it's harder to use the seat reclined when baby is little, if the tray gets in the way."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,"I bought this product based on all the 5 star reviews. I really wanted to like it. First I had it with cold milk. Yuck, it tasted like cardboard. Then I tried it warmed up like oatmeal & added brown sugar. Still tastes like cardboard. How can anything so tasteless be loved by so many people?"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.This Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)This product is an attractively priced and enjoyable introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I personally don't think of Earl Grey as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.) I wish you pleasure in exploring various teas."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,4.0,"I like beef jerky to be tender, not leathery and near impossible to chew through. This beef jerky comes in perfectly sized pieces and is very tender, probably even more tender than my favorite brand, Pemmican.As for the flavor, it's not very strong. There is some flavor but the tenderness of the beef makes up for the lack of flavor. It also isn't as salty as other brands of beef jerky that I've had before. Overall it's a great buy and I recommend it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was VERY skeptical to try this because I am a VERY picky eater. I was surprised and pleased that it's great. It tastes sort of like frozen orange juice concentrate. I mean, I don't want to just go eat it for a snack, but I definitely don't dread having to take it. It's also a smaller amount than I expected. If you put it on a teaspoon, it only takes up about half the spoon. Most of the fish oil supplements in this price range do not offer this much of the good stuff, so it's a real value. I would HIGHLY recommend getting this. Also, they have a deal where you get a free box with four proofs of purchase, so that makes it an even better value."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"Straight out of the jar this stuff is overpowering, (Most people wouldn't take a bite of a fresh lime and expect it to go down easy.) but used sparingly to accentuate any dish it adds a wonderful complexity and delight that will leave you craving more even while there is a fork-full still in your mouth.I always mince it and then...Mix (a dime sized amount or less) with ranch dressing for salads.Spread a little on a tortilla with cheese and hummus... then pan toast.Mix a little in your chicken or tofu salad for sandwiches or wraps.Mix a little into any curry dish you like.Mix a touch of it with oil then spread on roasting meats.Pretty much any savory dish you like chili or lime in can be substituted with hot lime. A small amount adds the Indian spice and tang I crave.Remember its better to start with too little and add some more than to over do it.I wish Patak's website offered more uses and recipes for this stuff, I need to do some more research to find other good things to do with it."

We also lightly poured it over brie cheese which made for a wonderful appetizer.The fact that it's all natural with no preservatives gives it even a higher rating.A delicious flavor enhancer you'll find many uses for."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"This stuff is the real deal. When I bought this, I bought it along with another Universal product to stack it with (Universal Storm.) I was extremely skeptical at first, and didn't think this stuff was going to do anything. But I had some money to spare, and I was told to at least give it a fair shot.I'm glad I did! The pumps are amazing and the gains are unbelievable. I'm lifting more than ever before, and it has only been four weeks. My transformation has been unbelievable!I know this isn't a placebo affect or anything because if anything, I was positive it wouldn't work. But even a skeptic like me can't deny it when I see real results. This is a great stack that compliment each other quite nicely.Just take 1 scoop of Shock Therapy before the workout and take Storm immediately after. On off days, just take the Storm by itself at about the same time you usually do. If you have your diet in check and are serious about getting into shape and packing on some lean muscle mass, then this is for you."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This was just what I was looking for when I bought it. Seeing the price and that it was in bags, I knew that it had to be ground and a cheaper grade tea, but I was just looking for a decent low cost Oolong, so I could reserve my good loose leave teas for those quite moments alone and special guest. One thing that irritates me about products sold on the Amazon site, is most of the time there is very little pertinent information regarding the product and sometimes, not even a picture. If I hadn't known how Oolong tea was suppose to be prepared, I would have passed on this one. I was right at guessing that all the writing on the box would be in Chinese and if it says on the box how to prepare it, I can't tell. That said, I bought 5 boxes since it had the right information to indicate that it was indeed from the right area in China to be true Oolong tea and I bought 5 boxes to try.Oolong tea requires a water temperature of 180F and the steep time of no more then 3 minutes. Steep time means how long the tea should be left in the hot water. Use a tea thermometer or a similar one that is capable of accurately reading between 160F and 212F(boiling) and never let the tea stay in the water longer then 3 minutes. A small digital timer works great for sitting next to you to get the timing right. Teas like this, that are from plant leaves, release tannin which makes the tea bitter and the maximum steep time is different for different types. Make sure you know the steep temperature and steep time ahead of time or you will always be disappointed in the results you get. If you like your tea stronger, DO NOT leave the tea in the water longer then the maximum steep time. Put more tea in the pot or cup before you add the hot water and always remove the tea before the tannin starts to be released, instead. If the tea taste bitter to you, then the leaves or tea bags have been in the hot water too long.Some high quality loose leave teas can be resteeped up to 3 times, with a slightly different taste upon each consecutive steeping. Always allow the tea leaves to completely cool down and stop the cooking process before it starts to release tannin and you should be fine using those for a second or even third steeping as long as you always keep removing it from the water before the leaves start releasing tannin.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Not all D-Mannose products are created equal. I discovered this because I tried a different kind first and the results were okay, but not amazing. I read that 100% pure D-Mannose is preferable, which is why I turned to this product, and I can definitely say that it works so much better. My UTI's are way more infrequent, and when they do come I can clear them up within a day or two. I take a dose every few hours during an infection, then one dose a day in between as a preventative measure. I haven't felt this free of UTI's in years. When they do come, they seem less severe because this product is already in my system. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from UTI's."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,yes - I agree with some other reviews that several doses a day are too much (unless you never want to leave the bathroom) but once you adjust and see how your body reacts - you can decide how and when to take it. I find once ---maybe twice a day sufficient...and it really does work too~!

He likes them when he's out plowing all night. He just brings milk in a plastic cup with a lid.I wish you could pick the # of each that you want. We don't like the raisin crunch one and hate that we give them away or just eat them.Nothing healthy here so don't buy this if you're trying to lose weight or watch your fiber intake. It's also alot of cereal, I could have used half of it. But it serves it's purpose for my husband & it's worth getting them for him."

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,"I have had a smaller product in the same style, and it was frustrating and time consuming to fill them because to fit my perscription drugs and nutritional supplements into the small spaces required they each be placed in a particular order. I had just told a friend i needed the same style in a larger size when i found these in a web search. They are large enough to fit my fish oil capsules, vitamins, and other supplements without forcing them. Last night i did 6 weeks worth of medications in 2/3 the time it used to take me.So far the section covers are sturdy, but i have only used the chests for a few weeks. The covers open on the opposite side of the smaller one, so i am having to relearn opening them, and the edge for lifting the covers would be easier on my arthritic hands if it were a little wider. I purchased two chests from Amazon and found the same product labeled for my HMO in the HMO pharmacy for 1/2 the price, so i bought four more."

These are built out of a nice fabric and will probably last a while. If you have a larger nose, this might still allow some light in around the nose, but it's better than others I've worn. Lastly, because of the contours or bumps around the eyes if you sleep on your side, it might be a little uncomfortable since the bump may fall on the side of your face a little. Overall, it does what it's supposed to."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,This kit is fine for moms that know for sure they can use the medium size Medela breastshield and it will be a good fit. If not you should order the parts separately. A poor fitting shield will lead to soreness and poor milk output -- certainly not worth the minimal dollar savings. Also the tubes do have to be purchased as a separate item -- I cannot see Medela making a kit including the tubes. This kit can be used with a number of different Medela pumps that use different tubes. [...] has a lot of information about this.

The concept is great and has worked pretty well, however, there is one major fault....my husband hates it! When you put the entire seat up for the guys to urinate, it does not stay up on it's own! He has to hold it up while he is urniating or else the seat comes crashing down. So, needless to say we will be getting rid of it soon. Also, my son often complains that it hurts his rear end when he is sitting on it longer than a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a man living in your house unless you want to annoy him on purpose. :)"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"This product was carefully packed and arrived very quickly. If you're looking for an authentic Moroccan accompaniment for your next meal, this is the only Harissa you need to buy. It is infinitely better than some of the Harissa products in a tube. I have had a jar open since just before Christmas (about 2 months, now) and I'm down to the last 3rd of a jar with NO spoiling, molding or drying out. The intense saltiness is nicely offset by the tanginess of the preserved lemon and the slow, subtle burn of the peppers adds a nice kick to sandwiches (especially roast beef) as it pairs nicely with mayonnaise as a condiment.A little goes a long way, making the price a bit easier to justify for an alimentary escape now and then.

grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,"My daughter is breastfed but I keep a few packs of these in the diaper bag with an extra bottle and a bottled water in case and it's been helpful in a few situations where I had to work later than planned or my older daughters band concert when I didn't have to stop to feed her, my mom was able to. It works well for a convenient occasional supplement without wasting a whole can that you won't go through in a month. Probably a good thing to have on hand for grandparents or caregivers who get occasional visits.My husband uses these when I work at night so that he doesn't have to get up and make a bottle. He leaves the water in the bottle ready so it's already room temperature and all he has to do is pour in the packet, shake it up and feed her when she wakes. His mom liked it too."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,1.0,"This is terrible food. It tastes like chemicals... even the thick 'teriyaki' sauce they give you can't hide the noxious flavor. On top of that it is so grossly over packaged I actually felt bad trying to get to the food, yet on the back they say they're ""saving the earth one bowl at a time"". I looked for further information on this magical plastic bowl, but found none, and they invite you to donate 19 cents, but fail to mention their donations to this cause. Classic ""green"" company, all marketing, no substance and making more bad food for people to digest. I don't know about the other products, but the Teriyaki Bowl is awful. No debating that."

It gives you a boost in energy, staves off the lethargy of the 3rd lap, and restores the bodies' balance of sodium, preventing cramps. And all this while being organic to boot! I think I really like that part best. Too much synthetic gels and food makes it difficult for the body to handle. Sure synthetic gels may work a little better, but it doesn't seem to make sense when you're trying to enjoy nature and get fit and healthy. I think the conscious effort to protect nature with the litter leash is very commendable. It's not too difficult to punch a little hole to prevent fully tearing across and letting loose upon the world a non-biodegradable bit of aluminum plastic tab, so i don't see why other companies can't do that too.

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"Occasionally I will recommend hydrogen peroxide to my dental patients to treat stubborn dental gum infections at home. Since most gum infections (gum disease) is caused and furthered by bacteria that cannot grow in an oxygen rich environment, it makes sense to flood their environment with a molecule that releases oxygen, like hydrogen peroxide.First have your teeth thoroughly scaled and cleaned by a dental professional. Then, when you floss, dip the floss in a mixture of 50% hydrogen peroxide and floss between the teeth, getting the floss as far down as possible under the gumline. Do every tooth contact twice and do this twice a day. It will cut down the pathogenic disease-causing organisms in the dental gum tissues pockets. It must be done consistently to have a lasting effect.This is certainly not a cure-all since it cannot reach to the depth of deeper gum pockets. However, it will help to kill the organisms that cause gum disease. It is best used when the disease is relatively recent and has not caused extensive pocketing or bone loss.One can finish the process by dipping ones toothrush in the 50% mixture of hydrogen peroxide and brushing the teeth and gums. Afterwards, one should rinse with water, as hydrogen peroxide leaves a an aftertaste that is not pleasent.JIm Koenig, DDS"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"The reviews were good; variety sounded good, but by the time you add the chicken and the tomatoes and the milk, you've paid several dollars for about 1/2 cup of dried potatoes and spices. Was not surprised to see that potato is the primary ingredient.Yes, as reviewers said, nice blend of spices but unless you add quite a lot of your own ingredients to the pot, there is no substance - just nicely flavored milk/water. Will not buy again."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I love this coffee! It's rich and flavorful and of all the pods I've tried to date, and I've tried a lot, it's my absolute favorite. It tastes strong but not burnt and rich without being overpowering. Haven't seen this brand and specifically this flavor of this brand in any store and it sells out a lot on Amazon so I try to buy it when I see it available. Good price, great aroma and most importantly, great flavor. I will definitely buy this again."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"This is a great booster seat that my infant will use into toddlerhood. She needed a rolled-up blanket to keep from slipping to the side when she first started using the chair at 4 and a half months old. There is definitely room to grow. The chair is easy to clean, attractive and stores away quickly. Sitting on a relatively low chair or couch is better for feeding the baby, but this is a small tradeoff. We take off the separate feeding tray and attach toys to the base tray. My daughter doesn't mind hanging out before and after meals. Perfect solution for a small apartment instead of buying a high chair and booster seat later."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"Wanting to get rid of about 15 pounds, I purchased this product intending to add a little boost to my workout routine and new diet. It says to take it in the morning when you first wake up, right before cardio, but I immediately felt so sick after taking it that I couldn't do any cardio. I continued to feel sick until well past noon that day. Tossed it in the trash, fast weight loss is not worth feeling crappy all day."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Well, I gave it four stars, but it's hard to say. I took it while dieting and working out. My work outs were pretty demanding and my diet was pretty damn healthy and low-cal. So it's hard to say if it was the pill, but I'm sure it played a role.Minutes after taking it, it kinda made me burp a little, and had a weird fruity like flavor when I burped (sounds funny). It did make me have a slight weird feeling in my stomach, but it was more like the feeling of ""my stomach feels like food would not be good right now.""One of the ingredients is a diuretic, which I guess could cause loose bowels(?) so maybe that's why some people experience stomach pains?Overall, I was pretty happy and would buy again."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,4.0,"If you love Pop Tarts, the low fat option is a great choice, they taste just like the regular ones.

I guess that would possibly explain why they were on sale."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"I was completely improvising. I had about 30 minutes to make dinner before my son's basketball practice started. I had chicken already thawed thankfully. I started cooking the chicken breasts on high heat to give them that nice texture on the outside. I mixed half of this sauce with some garlic (the minced kind in a jar), a little balsamic vinegar, a little soy sauce, some dried thyme, and a dash of orange juice. Once the chicken was browned on both sides I poured this mixture over the chicken and covered the pan. I turned the heat down to about medium and let it simmer for about 10-12 minutes I think. That was it. Delicious.If you're a fan of poultry with fruit you'll like this sauce. It has a nice smokiness that keeps it from being too sweet.I saw the suggestion to drizzle it over cheese and crackers and that's next on the list.This sauce would be great with shrimp and any other poultry, too. I'm guessing it would work great on the grill too - just brush it over some chicken or some grilled pineapple. Yum."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Used this product for about a month and a half. After having regular constipation sometimes no go for 4 or 5 days leading to strenuous bloody stools. I'm male and mid 30s. For the first week or 2 no big changes in stool however I immediately noticed better sleep and dreams. The changes in stools started around 3 weeks after taking them with softer more regular stools. Now about 30 days later I'm completely regular going 1 - 2 times a day taking 2 capsules (3 recommended) a night. This product also has pro biotics in the capsules as well. I personally recommend this product to anyone dealing with constipation or even problems sleeping as something natural that can be taken indefinitely resulting in being regular. Plus, it's not challenging to take, I keep mine in my medicine cabinet and take 2 before I brush my teeth before bed. Some pro biotics and cleansers I've taken have you take them before meals and/or after meals or 2 - 3 times a day etc. And other products I've tried on the web seem to be promoted by the company selling them. At least on amazon.com it seems to be one of the few places where you can still find valid opinions on products as they are selling many different brands and products and making money on them all and not the only one they sell. In short, works for me, hope it does for you if you've been as uncomfortable as I've been for years."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I picked up one of these second hand for $[...] to try with my twins. Anyone who hates the space a highchair takes up will love the simplicity of this. We liked it so much I ordered another one. Its kind of pricey new and you can find cheaper alternatives, but they are bigger and bulkier and I wanted simple. It cleared out my kitchen and the boys love being right up at the table with us. It takes them a few days to get used to having no tray, we had a lot of food on the floor the first couple days. But now they get it, and its so easy to clean under and wipes up easily. Its very sturdy. My second hand one was missing the pads, but I just took some GooGone to the glue and then stuck on little felt pads, fixed that problem right up. I can't say how well it works outside my house because I haven't tried it, but I can see it being helpful if it clamps on the table. Don't buy it if you have a glass top or pedestal or a lip on the table edge. Its very sturdy and is a much better alternative to 2 highchairs."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Severe Pain with Intestinal Gas in three and half year old boy.Suddenly my young son double-over onto the floor in agonizing pain until he was able pass gas. This has never happened before. Thinking it will pass in a day or two as it could be a stomach virus I remained cautious. Since everything else was normal, no vomiting, diareaha, fever; a good appetite and energy level, it seemed odd that all the acute pain was isolated to his large intestines. After a day of this I used Infants MYLICON to help relieve gas (as recommended by my family doctor), but that didn't help. The pain continued through 2 days and 2 nights. The frequency increased to every 15 minutes. Each episode he would curl into a ball in terrible pain until he could pass the gas, then everything was okay. He continued to have bowl movements, sometimes twice a day. Thinking back, however, his stool was long, narrow and soft. Nothing that would indicated ACUTE CONSTIPATION. But, maybe the narrowness of the stools could've been an indicator. After 2 days of these unusual episodes I decided something had to be done. I was prepared to take him everywhere until I got answer. I took him to a local immediate care office where a nurse practioner (requested a doctor) (waited 2 hours) initially said to just watch it. After she witnessed an episode she got more concerned. I had already made up my mind that we were going to the Emergency Room, which is where I should have gone in the first place. The ER doctor took an x-ray of his abdomen and it revealed severe fecal back-up on one side of his intestines. So, how could this have happened. It was obvious this happened over time. The fecal backup began when potty training started in July (its now February). He would pee in the potty and toilet with no problem. Up until mid December he would not poop in the toilet or potty, just in a diaper. This is when he would hold back the poop. Before potty training he would poop everyday or twice day. After potty training he pooped every other day or 3rd day. In mid December he accidently pooped in the toilet and had a light bulb moment and from then on no problem with pooping anywhere - even outside in the yard. But, the damage was done. With 5 months of holding back his bowl movements, his intestines became increasing clogged to the point where narrow poop was coming out and was having severe gas pain. The ER doctor prescribed an over the counter MIRALAX ( 1 cap full in 8 oz. of juice once a day). The MIRALAX began working within 3 hours and has been working into the 2nd day. He is having bowl movements about every hour - some watery, some like pudding. Now he has some pain when the poop is moving out,but its not the kind of pain where he is doubling over to the floor crying. We've made significant progress. The ER doctor recommended he stay on MIRALAX for several weeks to maybe even several months until he gets good, high quality poops going on a regular basis.

Prior to receiving them in the mail, I was just taking my regular women's multivitamin. This was the time when I had my morning sickness and nausea throughout the day and I felt terrible. Ever since getting and taking my Rainbow Light Just Once prenatals, I have felt wonderful with little to no nausea! I can't necessarily say for a fact that the vitamins make me feel better, but I think they did. One day when I forgot to take one when I normally do, I ended up feeling pretty awful. These have not upset my stomach whatsoever, they are very easy for me to take, and they don't taste or smell that bad. One other benefit I have noticed is they have kept me very regular, which is always a good thing! If you're used to taking a multivitamin, you should not have trouble with these. I'm glad I made the purchase!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :). 1000-count and 2000-count boxes are available.I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story.

The most important thing I have to say however is that there is NO REASON this thing should selll for $90! We paid $20 and that is what it is worth. Amazon, is this some kind of mistake?

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,This product was recommended to me by a friend. I am a very active and seemingly healthy individual who unfortunately gets sinus infections associated with mold and environmental allergies. Although I receive allergy injections about once a month I was still prone to sinus infections. After using one of these capsules daily I have not had a sinus infection in months. That is especially impressive given it is generally the fall and winter seasons I have the most trouble. I think this is an excellent product to consider if you feel immunocompromised or pick up infections associated with allergies. The company is using sound science methods to develop their products and should be consider legitimate. Best of health!

Because my condition came after back surgery, I need all the energy I can get to boost recovery, so B-12 cannot have hurt in that regard, and my energy level has been outstanding (circumstantial, I admit). Nonetheless, I can say that if you need B-12 on a continuing basis, sublingual tabs are said to be the most effective means of supplementation, and using Source Naturals on a subscription basis is definitely the most cost- and time-effective way to receive them. This particular formulation is non-medicinal tasting and dissolves quickly."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"So this stuff taste great. It feels a lot better mentally knowing that it's a natural product and has roughly the same consistency/viscosity as real sugar/sugar crystals. There is one caveat with this product, you will likely have diarrhea until you get used to it. If you use this for coffee like myself and you like to have that coffee before work or something, i would advise you to use it when you won't have issues with that. Supposedly this will stop once you develop some kind of tolerance, but i can't vouch for that since i've used it for the last few days. Other than that i think this is a great alternative to real sugar and the chemicals in other artificial sweeteners."

I tried the pork tenderloin recipe and it was very good.All in all, I liked the product and recommend it, but I do think a price of about [...].30 a bottle is a bit high for this sauce.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I was very skeptical of this product initially, but after accidentally biting my lower lip about 4 days ago while chewing gum, I developed a huge canker sore that was so painful I could barely speak. It was about half an inch long and a quarter inch wide. And it wasn't going away. I found myself using benzocaine solutions almost hourly, which as you might already know, amplifies the pain like 10x while you're putting it on at first. I was desperate. I heard about this product online, and actually drove to Walgreens and Target before finding it at CVS.Well, when I opened the package and saw these tiny, hard, white discs, I was even more skeptical. I thought, what good could these possibly do? Luckily the sore was in a spot where I could keep the area dry. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. Applying the disc on a dry spot is critical to having it stick and do its job. Unfortunately, the shape and size of the canker sore made it impossible to cover it entirely with the disc. There was a small part that remained exposed. As it turns out, this had some dramatic consequences.The disc turned into a gel as described, and did a fairly good job of relieving the pain. I could still feel some pain due to the bulk of the patch rubbing against my teeth, but much less than before. And since there was a small spot that didn't get covered, that still hurt a lot. I nearly thought of taking a second disc, cutting it in half, and applying it to get full coverage.Well, about 6 hours later, my tongue eventually rubbed the patch loose. It started to break off so I decided I'd pull the rest off and see what happened. This is where it gets interesting. The area that was covered had noticeably healed. The sore was still there--but because one area had been left uncovered, I could plainly see that even just after 6 hours something amazing happened. I could see that the covered part had already begun the healing process and was much less painful than the untreated area.I'm not kidding you. This product works. It's not perfect--for one thing, it's bulky and tastes a bit funny and looks really bizarre. It could also come in a larger size, or at least be a bit less expensive so you don't feel so bad about using more than one disc. But if you put it on at night before bedtime, let it do its work, it is way better than any numbing gels like Kanka or Zilactin or Anbesol. I've tried them all and I'm not going back. The trick is to get it to stick well (try tilting your head back and use a cotton swab; also, make sure you've pulled out the disc beforehand--the foil packaging is hard to open), and to leave it undisturbed as much as possible. It doesn't contain any anaesthetics--it works simply by covering the area, preventing irritation and exposure to the bacteria and enzymes in your saliva, and allowing your body to heal. For $10 I think it's worth cutting down on the excruciating pain of a canker sore."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush. I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth. This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size. Strangest thing I have ever seen. Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I stopped taking statin drugs because they were interfering with my memory and my cholesterol shot up to over 200. I read a book called ""Cholesterol Down"" which recommends this product. The product itself directs the user to take only 4 caplets a day, whereas ""Cholesterol Down"" advises six a day. I took six a day for six weeks and my cholesterol dropped about 50 points. I now take four a day.Please remember that cholesterol provides many more positive than negative functions in the body. Patients need to know their levels of c-reactive protein, which is perhaps a bigger indicator than cholesterol levels of trouble down the road. If I'm not mistaken (and if I am, someone here will certainly correct me), cholesterol acts as a patch to areas of the arteries that become inflamed. High levels of c-reactive protein are one of the causes of that inflammation, and one of cholesterol's jobs is to rush to the trouble spot and patch things up. However, the more the inflammation continues, the more cholesterol builds up, and then you've got big trouble.I experienced no side effects (I lost some weight but I'm not sure there's a direct connection). But check with your doctor and find out what your CRP level is. I've had doctors tell me a cholesterol level of 250 is no big deal so long as the CRP is where it should be."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,4.0,"I've bought Ghirardelli hot chocolate before, but it was a different type. The Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix doesn't mix well with hot milk, and you have to smash it up against the side of the cup with your spoon to break up the blobs of powder.This hot chocolate isn't as sweet as the other Ghirardelli cocoa I've bought before.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"My son is 28 months and was refusing his original high chair.He's been pretty good when we go out to eat, so we wanted to try an inexpensive restaurant style chair. This one was only about $35 and I got free 2 day shipping w/Amazon Prime. It came in 1-day...set up was very fast and easy, and it is well-made and quite sturdy.I don't like the color, but in fairness, I read the reviews and knew it would probably be pretty dark. For $35, how can you complain? And best of all, our son is sitting with us at the table again (most of the time)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"After reading so many favorable reviews I was convinced that I would at least be pleased, the only question being degree. Not so. Maybe I should have been suspicious when the listing said ""Only one bag left"" as I was ordering. But hey, that can mean they only roast 2 bags at a time, right? In this case, I think maybe not. As soon as I opened the bag, I feared the worst- no burst of that heavenly aroma, in fact more like opening a bag of ground coffee from the grocery store. That's pretty much the way the results worked out. I was using it French press, not espresso. Totally lifeless unless you power up to to where the bitterness becomes a factor, then it does finally get some flavor- though certainly nothing special, and still no aroma.All in all, most any grocery store house brand is its equal in flavor. Possibly its price gives the edge if that is all you are after. I suppose you get what you pay for but I would take some of the warehouse brands (one in particular) over this any day, on both counts. The package has no consumer decipherable date or freshness information- perhaps wisely so. Judging by so many other glowing reviews and only a few like mine, perhaps this was just the last bag from the last sack in their Lexington, KY warehouse."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I can't remember why I purchased colloidal silver but I had some in my medicine cupboard. I faintly remember one of my best friends telling me that it worked for sore throats. I of course had forgotten about that until day three of being sick when I was looking through my medicine cabinet for some sinus medication. I had run out of Theraflu so my husband went out and bought DayQuil. That didn't work as well so I ended up buying more Theraflu.Still I was not feeling completely well until I took 1/2 a teaspoon of colloidal silver. Within two days and only two doses I felt amazingly better. Normally I get sick once or twice a year and it seems to last for weeks. This time I was sick for less than a week and that is a great improvement. Later I found out that colloidal silver is actually a natural antibiotic. It will kill all types of viruses and bacteria.Please consult with your doctor before taking this product. It is not recommended that you take this for more than 10 days at a time. It really worked for me so I can highly recommend this product.~The Rebecca Review

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"This is a very nice condiment. Although habanero chilis are the hottest of all the chilis, I did not find this horribly spicy. It is called Sweet Heat. I thought it was a little too sweet, so I ""improved"" it with a couple of drops of soy sauce.It is described as a dipping sauce, but it has a lot of other uses way beyond simply dippingWe have been putting into our regular dishes. Put it into black bean sauce for a nice topping for broiled fish (like Alaskan Cod) over some rice. This sauce turned a simple broiled hamburger into a taste treat by mixing up some raw chopped garlic and a good jolt of sauce into the ground beef prior to broiling"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"I tried this sauce on both beef and chicken. I haven't yet tried it on fish. The mango is the overriding flavor in this sauce and the manufacturer bolsters the mango sweet with even more sugar. The end result was too sweet for use on red meats and just a little too sweet on chicken. I am going to give it a try as an addition to a sesame chicken recipe I have and I think it will fit in very well there.Once the sweet fades a bit, you get hit with the habanero burn. I think it was balanced well so that it didn't burn too much. It would have been easy to really overpower with the pepper but they did a good job of keeping that from happening.Overall, not bad. A little heavy on the sweet side, but if sweet is what you desire, you could do much worse than to give this sauce a try."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"The beauty of store bought prepackaged granola bars is that they are convenient and are usually non-sticky/messy compared to homemade ones.Nature Valley has always made some excellent bars that did not melt into a soggy mess when stashed in the car or brought on extended roadtrips/hikes/camping in the warmer months. However, this new line of bars from Nature Valley features a sweet peanut coating similar to the yoghurt coating pretzles are dipped in. This coating is quite sweet and melts in the heat.I would not reccomend particular Nature Valley line for outdoor activities in the warmer months, but would not hesistate to for the winter months.It is also a great treat to get kids off candy bars and into healthier granola bars as the sweet coating is quite peanuty and sweet enough. The bar itself does contain crisped rice that their original crunchy line does not, but it is still a vast improvement healthwise over other more common snack bars available."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"I really enjoyed theFischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauceso I was looking forward to trying the Mango Ginger Habe&ntilde;ero sauce. This sauce tastes good, and will be put to good use, but the mango nor the ginger flavors really come through. The heat is very mild too; not as hot as the Raspotle sauce, so don't worry about the habe&ntilde;ero's reputation. This sauce would go with a lot of things, but not as versatile as the Raspotle. The sauce isn't real thick, but thick enough to stay put. No aftertaste, good or bad, with this."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product works like a charm - exactly like they say. I don't know how it works, but it does. I have had constipation issues for years and this is the first product that really softens and makes everything move.I am also pleased with this seller who shipped very quickly."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"First of all I would suggest that the sauce be renamed Mango Honey Sauce. The most dominant flavor is honey.Second, the Haba&ntilde;ero in the name was waved at the vat in which the sauce was brewing. In spite of some of the other reviewers, this is not a spicy sauce.Thirdly, most anyone could make something like this and do it better given time and ingredients.BUT sometimes you don't have the time or the ingredients. Then it is good for a starter but needs help. More ginger, some real honest to doG peppers, garlic, lime juice, whatever. I roasted some chicken tonight with the sauce, some of the aforementioned ingredients and assorted veggies. The result was alright. My little girls liked it which goes to show how unspicy it is.I have nothing against having bottled sauces around to use for cooking. I like Trader Joe's Red Curry Sauce and the Peanut Sauce mix from Thai Kitchen when I do not have the time to make my own. I do not expect that this sauce will become part of my pantry."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,3.0,"The product is just as stated, I have not had a medication accident since I recieved the turtles. I bought two one for day and one for night pills.However before I ordered I e-mailed the seller and asked them to make sure the two would be distinctly differant colors so I would be able to easily tell them apart. They replied no problem. I was sent a green and a blue that, unless they are under bright light, I can not tell the difference.I do worry this could lead to errors in the future."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"Was really fast and easy to make, mixed it with some chicken and it tasted wonderful"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"This sauce has a nice heat level to it if you're not looking for a burn your mouth kinda kick. The sweetness combined with the ginger is just a little too much for me though. Don't get me wrong I love sweet sauces, but the somehow the ginger combined with the sweetness takes this sauce down to the ""not bad"" level.If you like sweet sauces and want a really delicious one I would highly recommend the Fischer & Wieser's Charred Pineapple Bourbon sauce."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,I am very satisfied with this product. I received it really fast and the product works wonderfully.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"These chole (spiced chickpeas and potatoes) are clearly the best of the commercial brands available! They are delicious, not too hot, complexly flavored, and very hard to find in ANY Indian groceries Also, they are marvelously priced here on Amazon. Can't say enough about them. A real quality product, worth every penny. Hope Amazon carries them forever!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This protein has a great taste, and as other reviewers say it dissolves really well. Unlike other ""flavored"" proteins it has a consistent quality, you know what you are getting in each pack"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is just a simple case of having the right flavor, right format, and right price to make it perfect for my workouts. No messy sticky gel on your fingers, easy to fit in your hand or a small pocket. The caffeine is a good bonus.I like Black Cherry, Margarita and Cola flavored the best.Cheers,"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"Many sauces similar to this one are basically flavored corn syrup, so it's nice to see a company using cane sugar to sweeten their product. Real sugar goes a long way not only in flavor, but how the sauce holds up as a finishing glaze in the oven or broiler. Deliciously sweet with notes of mango, honey and fresh ginger with a pronounced dry, spicy habanero pepper kick on the finish. The heat stays with you, but its not super spicy, so you don't have to be super adventurous to enjoy it. As a dipping sauce, it is simply too sweet and flavorful and will likely overpower whatever you're dipping in it, so it definitely works better as a finishing sauce than a dip. It might work when used with Asian inspired egg rolls. It's great with chicken or pork. Try it on baby back ribs instead of BBQ sauce... absolutely delightful! The cane sugar caramelizes under the heat of the broiler creating a delicious sweet and spicy glaze that is simply superb with pork. Recommended."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"I really like to cook and I cook a wide variety of cuisines. I was quite eager to sample this product, advertised as both a marinade and a finishing sauce. Essentially what it is -- is a very high quality ""sweet and sour"" type sauce.I found the mango-ginger combination to be quite tasty. The flavor was fresh and bright and would complement grilled chicken and pork. It would be equally good for dipping various Chinese-style appetizers. However, I was somewhat disappointed (hence the lack of a 5th star) because the habanero flavor was minimal. Both heat and flavor were barely discernable. When one sees ""habanero"" on a label, one expects a significant ""kick"". In this product, the ""kick"" was definitely lacking.A very good product nonetheless."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I was looking for a replacement for Odwalla Chocolate Chip Peanut bars and tried these. I'd go back to the Odwalla Bars in a flash which have whole peanuts and whole choc chips. These bars are more like stale rice cripsy bars with a chocolate coated bottom. They are very hard (i.e. like they are stale)and do not have much of a peanut taste. Besides, they have too high a percentage of soy, but I was desperate (sigh)."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is a great product, however, purchasing on-line is way too expensive. I later found the same product locally for one-third the price. If you have a Sam's Club near you -- it is much cheaper there."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"First of all, let me start off by saying I usually don't take vitamins or minerals. The reason being, I've taken them in the past, mostly vitamins (not minerals), and to be honest with you I didn't feel any better. My feeling is if it doesn't do anything for you why take it???Here's why I changed my mind and decided to try magnesium:One day I just happened to be watching TV and saw this doctor by the name of Carolyn Dean, M.D. ND on a show called 'Your Health' talking about the many benefits of taking magnesium.Many health problems such as insomnia, diabetes, asthma, to migraines to heart disease, etc. can be treated with magnesium. One of the major benefits is it relaxes your muscles. I was intrigued, it almost sounded too good to be true.Long story short, I started taking magnesium taurate (by Cardiovascular Research) about 3 weeks ago and used it for my on and off insomnia that I had been having for the past two years. Not having high expectations (because of my past experiences) I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong! The first night I took it I fell into a deep sleep, like 1-2-3, and woke up extremely refreshed. I couldn't believe it. 3 weeks later I can still fall asleep right after taking the pill, it isn't a fluke. It's amazing how much more energy you have when you get a good night's sleep.This definitely is a good product/brand & I urge anyone who has trouble falling asleep to buy it!"

I love this high chair and I think it's a great value!"

With the medela icepack (labeled as ""for breastmilk storage"" I can fit 3-4 regular playtex bottles.

This bag has lasted 4 years for us and although we wish it was a little bigger - it seems every bigger bag too big. We love it."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,3.0,"Hi, I bought this product in a pack at Costco. I have to say that compared to other sauces I favor (my favorite so far is Trader Joe's tomato and basil marina in a can), this one is a bit bland. I am having it now again for the third or fourth time, and this time, it tastes better after adding salt, grated cheese and hot sauce. It probably is a sauce true to italian marina as I believe I see chunks of carrots and this is what is called for in my Italian cookbook. And perhaps I have gotten too used to the strong tomato flavor in other sauces, but I'm rating it mediocre due to the general lack of flavor."

They were not as tasty as the first one I had tried. And after a few days of eating one a day parts of my body started to become swollen. My hands, feet, knees, underarms,and a little of my face became swollen. It could have been the Luna bars but it could have been something else. I love Luna bars but I wouldn't get the S'mors anymore. Maybe something else."

I'm a coffee drinker normally, but when I am not in the mood for coffee, this wonderful tea gets me through the day. I prefer the Red to the Gold, personally - it seems a bit stronger. Like the other reviewers, this is the only tea I drink now - I used to have a cabinet full of various English Breakfast Teas, Irish Breakfast Teas, various brands - now there's more room, because this one beats them all. Once you've had Yorkshire, you can't go back!"

The table came preassembled and super easy to flip open and set up. The optional built-in heating element is terrific (no separate pad to buy). The table is extremely sturdy and a breeze to flip back closed, and it fits right under our bed for storage. I am very pleased with the quality and would recommend it to anyone."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"You can taste the mango and ginger in this sweet sauce, but the habaneros did not make it into the bottle.Last night's dinner featured brined thick pork chops which were marinated in this sauce for an hour after after rinsing off the brine. They were then grilled for about ten minutes, basting after turning. The sugar in the sauce caramelized nicely on the grill. Before serving I poured a little more fresh sauce over the chops. The chops were very tasty and had a nice tropical flavor, but zero heat.Today I had the leftovers from the chops, with a little more sauce fresh from the bottle. I wanted to see if something had interfered with the taste of habaneros last night. Again the sauce had a strong flavor of mango and ginger, but was still not hot.To sum it up, this sauce is good, but not awesome. If you're looking for heat, you will have to try something different, or add it yourself. I'll definitely finish off what I have, but likely will not order again."

Fresh coffee made to order, endless variety, no waste, etc. It is a shame that so many settle for the coffee pods made by big commerical roasters like Melitta and Douwe Egberts.

Having had the opportunity to taste a variety of pods, I hope the list below of my favorites is helpful. Many of these are also much better coffee at a lower price!

grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"BIG REDThis is one of my all time favorite drinks of all time and to be honest when it comes to cokes, soda, pop or what ever you want to call it I doubt there is much out there that can top this. I was born in Texas and once again as off 5 or 6 years ago I made way back here and could not have been happier to have this drink at my disposal once again. For many many years while living on the East Coast namely Maryland were this drink is not available all I could do was bring some back with me after visits to family back in the Lone Star State.If you want to be specific this is a cream soda, a red cream soda to be exact. But to all those saying I am not a fan of cream soda I assure you that red cream soda has a much different taste as compared to just cream soda. This wonderful drink that comes out of Waco Texas is really one of the most refreshing soft drinks I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. For all you calorie nuts out there this does have 150 worth per can of it but if you watch your intake this could be a wonderful luxury drink as my grandmother says about the Vanilla Float version of Big Red.If you ever come across this drink any were or order drinks from the net I highly recommend it, even if you only drink these type of drinks every so often you should at least try it. My best friend from Maryland came with me to Texas a couple of times and after trying this drink he is hooked. It is important for you to know that the guy is a mixed martial artist and does not really drink soft drinks; this would be his luxury drink."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,3.0,"I've been taking Super Cleanse now for 3 weeks and it's done the job. As opposed to other reviews where people were going many times a day and such, this has been ""quietly effective"" for me. There's been nothing like diarrhea or frequent bowel movements, at the most I've gone maybe 3 times in one day, but usually two. A little gassy and liquidy for the first week, and I felt a bit more cleaned out, but then it's settled into a routine after that. In fact, things aren't that much different from normal, so I'm not sure whether this stuff doesn't have that much effect on me, or I didn't have that much to clean out in the first place."

If I don't, when I wake up I can almost not get out of bed.The other review on here said some people may think it is due to a placebo effect...I am a VERY skeptical person...and I DO NOT like taking pills...weather natural or not.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I have tried 4 different kinds of oolongs, and found this tea to have a very rich, woodsy taste. It brews a dark red/brown color in comparison to some other lighter oolongs, which brew golden. Although it tastes quite strong, which I like, it lacks the sweet aromatic flavors that I love in a previous oolong I've tasted. Those tend to be much more expensive, so I settled for this one. It tastes pretty good & seems good quality for the price. I'm pretty much addicted to oolong tea, so I needed something that I could buy at a good price & still enjoy."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"I thought this was a really great idea to organize all of my breastmilk after working so hard to pump it all. Well, I purchased this along with the Lansinoh bags, which I preferred over the First Years bags because they were BPA free and sturdier. Well, even though the Lansinoh bags are better, they don't exactly fit this organizer - they are slightly wider than the container. So, when the milk is being put into the organizer, the sides of the bags get squeezed and, ultimately, in my case, have caused tears in the bags.So, when I go to defrost bags in the fridge, I notice that they always leak. Now I have to put the bags in an additional ziploc bag to defrost them so that I don't lose all of the precious milk.What I have started doing is putting the freshly pumped milk into the freezer laid flat, and then, once it is frozen, putting it into the organizer on an angle without using the retractable flattening thing in the container. You can't store as much, but I use the lid as an additional tray and I can store more that way."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Delicious. It tastes good but I had trouble figuring out it was steeped and ready. Call me dumb-white tea has no color! The teas came quickly and are more than advertised. Yum! It is so relaxing to sit with a cup of this tea.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I bought this because it got fairly good reviews and was not too expensive. It was a total waste of money as far as I'm concerned. I only used the thing maybe twice. It took me about 45 minutes to get maybe 4 ounces of milk. This is the only pump I have ever used so 45 minutes may be the norm, but it was kinda pointless to me. By the time I finished pumping it was time to feed the baby again so I didn't really get any time to GO and do things around the house. It was quicker just to breast feed, but this may be a good purchase if you are desperate for a pump and can't afford a super good one. You may consider contacting your local hospital and they can rent you one that is ""industrial strength"" and it would probably be a smarter purchase."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"I bought this from one of Amazon's agents (senders affiliated with Amazon but are not Amazon). The product arrived on-time (if not early even), and I have been using the product now for about two weeks. The consistency is a bit ""odd"", but it seems to be working. Unlike Mederma and other products, there's no smell NOR is this runny at all; it's rather sticky and gel-like, but rubs in completely with no residue on your fingers, hands, whatever you choose to use. I will let you know the results after 6-8 weeks but this seems to be a good product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"In marked contrast to their famed Raspberry Chipotle sauce, this Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is more subtly flavored, but also sweet, with just a slight tingle on the tongue to let a person know that there are some habanero peppers in there.

I'm a grad student and rarely get enough sleep (and really, how many of us do?), but after a smoothie with a spoonful of maca in the afternoon, I fell asleep effortlessly that night and then nearly exploded out of bed the next day (badly startling my poor bf, I'm afraid--he's always been a morning person, but I generally am a hard sleeper and require lots of loud noise, multiple alarm clocks and strong coffee in the morning to get going.) I've been charging out of bed every morning since. Yet there's no caffeine jitters, no crazy buzz; you can sit quietly or go work out or read or whatever you normally do.The taste--well, it's got a little bit of an unpleasant bite, and I find myself adding more fruit, agave nectar or stevia to my smoothies to compensate. Maca is also sold toasted (or maybe roasted?) and is supposed to be sweeter and much tastier that way, so if the taste is bothersome and you don't care if it's raw or not, that might be a good option."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"This is a great pump, it performs very well as long as you aren't trying to pump multiple times a day while at work. I would recommend this to moms who pump occasionally, but not for commuting moms. For me, it took about 40 minutes (20 minutes/breast) to get 6-8 ounces of milk. Having to do this twice a day at work got very time consuming, so I bought the Medela Pump In Style Advanced that allows me to pump both breasts at once."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I received 5 of these test strips free with my order, and even ordered 5 extra just in case. I'm the type of person who always wants to test as soon as possible and as often as I can. I decided to try one of these test a few days before my period was due. I didn't properly read the directions and assumed I wasn't pregnant because I immediately saw the test line and nothing under it. I tested again 2 days later and this time waited about a minute after and saw a faint line. I wasn't sure if that was correct because the line was so faint, so I emailed the company and they instructed me to check with a doctor but a line should mean pregnancy. I retested a few days later and the line continued to get darker. Anyhow, I used to spend a lot of $$ of pregnancy tests but there is no need, they are all the same.A few tips:You need something to collect your urine in, because you have to dip the stickWait after you test to see the real result, the test line shows up immediatelyIf there is a line, even a faint line, you are probably pregnant (I tested a week later, just to see how dark the line would be, and it's not as dark as the test line)Good luck!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I want to share (with everybody who is struggling with Candida) my experiences. Yes, I have Candida and have been looking for a miraculous cure to get rid of it.....it is easier to grow it in your body than get rid of it. I had been researching different diets and food supplements like Threelac for some time already. I have read a lot of positive things about Threelac and decided to go for it. Well, unfortunately after 2 months of using it....my Candida was still doing very good in my body (but not me). To add something to it....I WAS (AT THAT TIME) ON A STRICT CANDIDA DIET (not eating everything...as many people do when taking Threelac). SORRY TO SAY....BUT THREELAC DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME FIGHT MY CANDIDA!!!!I turned to other products....and they seem finally to work. I am still on Candida diet...but fight it with ORGANIC PLAIN KEFIR (one glass per day...no matter when) and 15 drops of GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT mixed in half glass of water (1 drink per day). MY CANDIDA STOPPED BOTHERING ME ANYMORE!!!!!! I STILL HAVE IT....BUT I DO NOT HAVE ANY SIMPTOMPS I USED TO HAVE.I discovered that diet, KEFIR and GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT is the only way to go. NOT THREELAC!!!!"

I have gotten nearly everyone in my family off of the chemical sweeteners and using stevia as a healthier alternative. Highly recommend it to everyone wanting a natural no calorie no carb sweetener!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I just wanted to share my experience with Viralys powder. It was recommended by our ""vet"" for our cat who frequently gets a watery eye. The first time it was used in conjunction with eye ointment and it cleared right up. A few weeks later, it started tearing up again and we started her back up on the powder (a heaping scoop morning and evening in her wet food). Again, it cleared right up - this time, without the ointment. We also used it when two of our cats started sneezing. We checked with the vet, and since they weren't lethargic and were eating well, we put them on the powder too, and within a week they were both over it. I feel it's a great product and would recommend it to keep your pets healthy and to boost their immune system!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I am very happy with this diaper bag. It is roomy, easy to clean, neutral so even my hubby will carry it around and it even has an insulated bottle storage compartment. I also like the inter-changeable flap feature. It does fit two 9-oz Avent bottles and works well at keeping formula safely chilled. I also like the fact that the strap is very easily adjusted. My only complaint (a minor one) is that when it is full, the flap tends to fail to stay on despite the magnetic closure mechanism. I've just made it a point to not over-fill it. Problem solved! Other than this, I love this bag. It is stylish. Totally practical. Definitely affordable. I have compared it with other pricier diaper bags and it is still by far my first choice."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"I have tried this product on both fish (tuna) and chicken as a marinade. I have also used it for dipping veggies in. It tastes pretty good in all those cases. Personally, I think that it is too much like mango puree without enough of the habanero. I still like it though. My wife likes it more than I do since she is more sensitive to spicy-type heat.This is not something that I would use regularly, but I do recommend it when you want something that is good, and different than whatever you may use in your standard meals."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I used this all the time when I first got it b/c the restaurant chairs are just not clean. It was great until my kids (I have two) figured out that if they pull on the edges they can get it off the highchair, bunch it in their laps, and now make a bigger mess. Now, I just wipe down the parts of the highchairs they can reach with an antibacterial wipe. I would recommend this for smaller kids or maybe older ones who understand they shouldn't try to remove it. One great perk is that you can change how you use the straps to make a seat belt since the ones that come on the highchairs are almost always broke."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,I bought this tea on sale at Whole Foods for $6.99. It is definitely overpriced at the sale price. The quality is only average. I actually thought it lacked flavor. There are much better black teas on the market for far less.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"This highchair is awesome. I say that pretty much only because of it's ease of cleaning. The tray can be quickly rinsed off in the sink and it comes with an extra insert if you want to throw one in the dishwasher. The seat is also easily cleaned with a wet towel since it's hard plastic and the padding is not cloth. The tray is very easy to install and remove and can be done with one hand once you get a feel for it.The pneumatic feature is neat, but it doesn't adjust enough to get overly excited about. It moves maybe 6-8 inches. The whole thing is also easy to move around since it has wheels but with the brake applied is very difficult to move. It's very stable as well. The one complaint I have is the safety belts being hard to clean. They are removable however so that makes it a little easier."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,Nice Pill organizer. Very nice. Roomy pill sections. Close and stay closed.
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"This mask is just what my husband and I were looking for. It has an adjustable strap which makes it very comfortable to wear and stays in place. You can fall asleep while you are using it but don't keep it on too long because your eyes will feel strange. Don't worry, though the strange feeling will go away in an hour or so. When you warm it up the heat will stay for approximately 15-20 minutes which is about how long you should keep it on at a time. I would definitely buy another one of these. Also, the shipping was even quicker than expected which was very nice. This is a must buy if you have sinus issues or a cold. It will make you feel better."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Great value for the price! This product replaced a well worn table carrier I use to use. I bought this table because it was the right size and did not have wheels. I have found wheels on a table can be in your way and so don't work well on sidewalks or city streets.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,crackers biscuits,3.0,"Basically these are large fig newtons, cherry flavored. They're also small sized, good for toddlers and calorie-conscious adults, but be aware that they are less than 1/2 the size of an average cereal bar. I bought these thinking ""healthy snack"", but really I'd be better off giving my child some whole grain toast w/ jam and nut butter. These are convenient, though, but very crumbly/messy--not good car seat food IMO."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,1.0,"Whole-wheat pasta is better for you. However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff. It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz. To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box. This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I have killer chronic back pain because of a car accident years ago and a bulging disc. I can't get to a massage therapist as often as I need to, so having a way to hit pressure points on my own back is really nice. The little knobbies that are supposed to do your neck don't really work for me, but for getting under my shoulder blades and even running up and down the sides of my spine, the pointy end really works. It has more bumps than I use, but once I got used to how it works, it really works."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"I am a huge fan of Beer Creek's Chicken Noodle Soup. The soup is delicious and I buy it by the case. I decided to try the Vegetable Beef. Bought a case and ended up not liking it at all. It just seems to have a horrible taste -no vegetable or beef flavor at all. So if you happen to try this one FIRST, don't use it as an example......it's just a matter of personal taste because the Chicken Noodle is a 10-star soup!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My cholesterol was over 400 and drugs could only bring it down to 297. My doctor prescribed high doses of Lipitor, but this caused me to have headaches that would not go away. Other cholesterol drugs had similar (and worse effects) on me. Tests also showed early signs of liver disease (due to the medication).Next, I went to a naturopath and he ""prescribed"" ProFibe and told me to buy it on Amazon.com. After taking ProFibe for two weeks, my cholesterol went down to 190 and now hovers around 180. Since ProFibe is a food (made from citrus fiber and other natural ingredients), it regulates cholesterol the way nature intended it to be regulated. Unlike cholesterol drugs, ProFibe will not destroy your liver.My favorite way to take ProFibe is to mix one level teaspoon with a high protein chocolate shake (Muscle Milk, Premier Protein, etc) three to four times a day. ProFibe comes with a scoop (equal to 2 teaspoons), but I find that makes the beverage too grainy.How ProFibe works"

It works nothing like the original. This ""knock off copy"" has ROUGHLY FORMED copper balls (they use same process as wood nail heads are formed.)These sometimes scratched instead of massage. Being made of copper it tends to bend and distort easily.The original one we used was made of stainless and had SMOOTH plastic beads on the ends of the fingers."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This ended up being a waste of my money because I couldn't take the product. One of the three products is a powder that you need to mix with eight ounces of warm water and drink in the morning. When you mix the powder in with the water, it immediately clumps as you are stirring, and the clumpy, powdery, grainy taste of this going down your throat is disgusting. I tried to swallow that mix for six days and then gave up; each time, I could not keep it down. It would have been much better if the powder came inside capsules. I would not recommend this to anyone."

I have tried some of the brands advertised as tasting great in some of the fitness magazines but this one is the real deal. They don't taste artificial or cardboardy--in fact they are so good that I have eaten them as a snack between meals.These bars are fairly large, so half a bar works for me (when eaten as a snack).I expect that the other flavors are great as well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I'm not a fan of 'fad' diets, and some might argue that South Beach falls into that category, but these South Beach bars are nothing but healthy, tasty, and serve as a great meal replacement option. The chocolate crisp bars are probably the best flavor, and are surprisingly enjoyable for the amount of nutrition packed into them. They're not like the cardboard flavored dense nastiness of many meal bars. Accompanied by a nice piece of fruit, they'll replenish you after a strenuous workout.Great tasting, solid nutrition, well worth it."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I have returned almost everything I buy for my back pain but this is one thing I've kept. If you are 70, your back is shaped more like a ""C"" than an ""S"", and have the flexibility of a block of cement, this probably is not for you.I am middle aged, average height, average back flexibility, with no fusion, scoliosis, or acute herniation. It doesn't even fit me perfectly but is in the ballpark. I still arch over my 6"" foam roller and 3"" foam baseball to work out problem areas. Also you can roll around a little on them vs. this thing where you are pretty much stuck in one position. I can do some ""pelvic tilts"" and wiggle side to side a little while on the Spineworx.It is uncomfortable at first so give it a few days. A couple of hours after I first used it, I noticed my back was hurting less. It is especially useful to lie on the Spineworx after gardening, etc. to get the posterior ligaments to tighten back up since they get stretched from bending forward.I don't follow the instructions where they say to have your legs out straight. I put my feet flat on the floor as this is more comfortable. Sometimes keep my butt slightly off the ground for decompression at L5.PROS:1) Less likely to ""jam"" the vertebrae than Yoga poses like the ""Cobra"".2) Helps work out the muscle imbalance if one side of your back has more developed and tight muscles than the other.3) Helps to restore the ""S"" curve to the spine unlike something like ""Static back"" where your back is flat on the floor.4) Doesn't take any effort.CONS:1) Yellow rubber showing signs of wear after 2 weeks of 2x/day use.2) You will need to provide your own head support.3) Does not stretch the abs. You will need to do the ""Cobra"" stretch for that.4) Generalized stretch that doesn't get to every problem area you might have."

Teff whole grain can be cooked as a breakfast porridge or as a dinner course rather like polenta, either soft or solid.I picked up ""Bob's Red Mill Teff"" at my local grocery, in response to my teenage son's interest in cooking grains from around the world. There are two adequate recipes on the package, but we didn't follow either exactly. In the dinner recipe, we used cardamon in place of cloves and dried apricots in place of dates. If you've ever cooked grits or polenta, you won't find teff difficult at all. Check the other brands of teff here on amazon if you decide to order some; ""Bob's"" appears to be the most expensive."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,Not what I'd hoped. The sweet taste from the molasses totally overshadows the taste/flavor of the sesame seeds. May as well call it molasses bars with a hint of sesame oil.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I have purchased this item infrequently in the past. It's an okay item, but no wow factor. Definitely more healthy than most snacks. Taste is okay. I prefer the all peanut snack bars from Nature Valley."

This is very powerful stuff that can kill anything. If you are not careful, this stuff can kill more than just your wart, but rest assure, your wart will definitely die. The question is when. The more you use the wart stick, the faster it burn the wart, but you will lose some of your skins around it. If you apply the wart stick in a thin layer daily according to the recommendation, it might take couple weeks depending on the size of your wart. In fact, i think this stuff kill all skin diseases. Just be careful with it because this is powerful stuff."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"As far as my husband and I are concerned, Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate mix has the best flavor out of all the choices on the market for making hot chocolate. We use it very frequently, but in a special way. I'm not fond of just drinking coffee like most people do. I love cafe mocha. So, we found a quick way to make a mock version of cafe mocha but emptying (1) bag of Swiss Miss into a large cup of coffee and tweeking it a little however we like with either a little more cream or sweetener. I love it. So we use a lot of Swiss Miss and buying it in the Value Pack,Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Milk Chocolate Value Pack, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)the great price that Amazon provides is SUPER!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,2.0,It's OK. Certainly not as good as what you'd get in a restaurant. I thought it was kind of expensive for the portion and quality.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,I like the taste of the Raw Revolution Bars. The problem with the Cashew and Agave nectar bar is the consistency. It gets very soft and VERY OILY. I sometimes eat half and fold the package to close. With this one it leaks . Unfortunately I put one in my handbag and it leaked through ruining the leather. 8-(I like to carry a snack with me. This one will be for at home . Try the chocolate with coconut and the raspberry chocolate. I don't leave home without one.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"The pill containers are perfect for my needs, the colors are cute. The stand squeaks when pulled across a smooth surface, so I added two pieces of masking tape on each end, that got rid of the issue. I enjoy filling the containers! I am able easily to dump out the pills for one section by placing part of my hand over the other section. Each section is big enough for 3 medium, 1 large, and 1 small pill. Wouldn't work if you take a whole lot of vitamin/supplement size pills!"

I used to buy them at Raley's/Bel Air, but they discountinued them for some reason. They are so good, you can eat them out of the bag, like potato chips! Not only are they delicious, but they are Fat Free and Vegetarian! They are also very easy to make. They simmer in hot water for 5 minutes. I hope Santa Fe never stops making these and Amazon never stops selling them!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"A beautiful Malaysian blend of spices, with a stronger hint of aniseed then any other curry powder.

It is my favorite flavor of all the Glucerna bars and I cannot for the life of me figure out why my local grocery doesn't keep it on the shelves. Tough for me to stop at one myself.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I'm a little dissapointed that the taste isn't stronger but the nutritional facts are pretty good for a low-carb protein bar.

Once I saw this on amazon I had to try it. I eat it five to six mornings a week. I substitute once or twice a week with organic eggs, cheese & vege's. When I eat this cereal I mix it with organic frozen blueberries & a banana. What a way to start the day. My blood work at my last yearly physical was excellent, and my doctor let me know. I'm 52 years old and abused my body for 25 years with drugs and alcohol. I now live a clean life, spirit, mind, & body and this product fits right in. Have plans to try a few more of Bob's products in the future."

While shopping a few weeks ago, I decided to buy a bag of the Darn Good Chili because it appeared easy to prepare. Without a doubt, it was THE.BEST. I dropped some off at my son's house and he called to tell me how delicious it was and asked why I never prepared it while he was growing up!I added browned chopped meat and hot pepper.

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,toaster pastries,4.0,"I am not sure why I bought these, I maybe thought they just looked good. I didn't realize I was buying so many when they came. This is like buying bulk at costco which I probably could have gotten cheaper there. Anyways, the taste on these things is a little more than average, they taste good. My favorite will always be S'mores though and I think a lot of people will agree. These taste just like a cinnamon bun though and are pretty good. 4 Stars out of 5."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I have tried various products for cracked/rough feet but Callex is the only ointment that was able to soften my feet within one week. Even though the directions say to apply it twice a day, I only applied it once a day usually in the evening while I watch TV or read. I would highly recommend Callex."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I saw this product for the first time in a shop and I thought that it was for washing teeth, but what a mouth it must be. Then, I saw it again in my weekly professional massage session to be use for soothing and stimulating muscles due to pain caused by, may be, emotional muscles issues. The design is compact and perfect to have in the car or boat so that it is ready and handy to be use after some extenuating day or just for fun as I do. I suggest anybody to have some accessories to diversify body massage as if you you're your professional acupressure next to you. It had worked well with my knuckle joints, facial massage, kneading massage, critical points in my upper shoulders and knees. Once you have it, visit a professional massager to have and idea about the pressure you should apply on your body parts and times."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,1.0,"This product is almost 30% sugar! (18 grams out of 63 grams in the single-serve box) That's a greater sugar content than in ice cream or pecan pie, and much more than in Frosted Mini-Wheats. It's over four teaspoons of sugar. This single small box has 240 calories. Be careful with fat-free or low-fat products---they are often high in sugar and calories."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,2.0,"I been using product now once a day for a week with good amounts of energy but had to visit my doctor today because of a spell of angina heart pain yesterday and today. I'm exhausted and layed in bed the whole day because the Doc says ""this added boost also consumes your bodies stores of vitamins, nutrients, elecrolytes"". So I doubled up on a daily dose of B50 vits and a multivitamin along with lots of water. I'm starting to feel normal. I won't use this product anymore."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"My husband brought this home for me as I suddenly needed a pump due to a medical need to pump and dump for a day or two. I was very grateful, but soon discovered that it made me very sore. And, it didn't seem to pull much out. My hands tired quickly (I used to have a Medela hand pump and it wasn't any where near as tiring as this one is.) As I still had my Pump 'n Style, but had thrown away all the pieces since I didn't think I needed them, I found the replacement parts at a medical supply store and used that instead (Incidently, the replacement parts only cost about a dollar more than the pump did at Target, though if I'd had to have purchased a new Medela, it would have been twice as much). While even the Pump 'n Style didn't help me pump much more than this one, it was so much more comfortable and less tiring. So, for the money, if you really only need this for a short time, it might work, but if you'll need it longer, I really recommend avoiding this one unless you really don't have a choice."

Despite the kitten receiving enough blunt-force trauma to kill the entire cast of CSI not a drop was spilt...no tears then!

I was very happy to find this product as it is vegetarian, thus safe for me. It also only has soy in the form of soy sauce. That is another big plus. I like to prepare it topped with a poached egg that I mix through the soup.Since amazon doesn't have all the ingredients for this, here they are )from the Annie Chun site):IngredientsNoodles"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"Please don't be fooled that this is a weightless ""answer in a bottle"". Alli is meant to supplement an exercise program along with a sensible eating plan. If you make the mistake into thinking that all you need do is take this product, and you will drop pounds, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. On the other hand, if you've committed to reducing your fat calories, and eating sensibly, the addition of this product will certainly allow you to lose three to five percent more weight. I guarantee, you will experience man adjustment phase. Once in which you will take the product and regulate how much fat you eat in a meal. In the initial learning phase, if you have not trimmed much of the fat from your meal, be ready for some soiled underwear. On the other hand, if you make the mistake of taking one of these pills in conjunction with a triple-decker hamburger, you better be wearing a ""Depends"". Eating sensibly, exercising then I have the chance, and taking Alli, I have lost 45-pounds since February. Despite being aware of the warnings, I too have had several accidents. Overall, it is a good product and performs as expected. I am sure that of the weight I lost, probably ten of those pounds are attributed to Alli."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,The first thing you taste when you first bite into these bars is peanut. Then almond followed by berries. I devour them in a minute.I give them only 3-stars because there is too much High Fructose Corn Syrup in them.My search for the perfect energybar continues !
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Odds are, if you've come this far in your search for creatine, you know what it does.This product not only gives you a huge amount of the highest quality creatine monohydrate you can buy, it does it for the lowest amount of money you can find.Given it's recommended you only take creatine for 2-3 months at a time before taking a break, this 80+ serving package has all you need.Not to mention the ""Creapure"" labeling, which essentially means it's the best stuff you can get (from Germany!).Look no further (and don't stop curling 'till you vomit!)."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I bought these bottles before my son was born because I had planned to breastfeed him. I went back to work when my son was 2 weeks and I tried this bottle. He didn't have a problem taking it at all but I didn't realize that you had to press the sides of the nipple to get the milk back down so I thought it would be inconvenient to have to take the bottle apart to get the milk out (and I definitely didn't want to waste my pumped milk!) so we switched to Playtex Drop-ins. Within a week, my son had nipple confusion and I was exclusively pumping. I went back to these bottles in an attempt to get him to breastfeed again and they were a lifesaver! I breastfed my son until we was 6 months old and he switched between breast and these Breastflow bottles without any problem whatsoever. I have tried several different bottles since then (my son is now 9 months) and the only bottle other than this he will take is Avent (and those leak!!.) I love these bottles mainly because they were the only reason I was able to breastfeed my son but also because they are wider than other bottle which makes cleaning super easy, they don't leak, the top of the bottle fits on the bottom of the bottle while you are feeding (super convenient so you don't lose it!) and the 9 ounce bottles actually hold more than 9 ounces (I mix the formula in his bottle and when you put 9 ounces of water and the scoops of formula on top, many other bottles overflow). I absolutely love these bottles and will not use anything else!!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"Our son has serious allergy problems that make it hard for him to breath at night especially. He just couldn't sleep, and was getting so tired we ended up keeping him out of school for several days. We tried all sorts of medication, and ended up at the emergency room in sheer despair. Doctors suggested nasal irrigation, and we ordered the Grossan system immediately. First couple of days, water was getting in our son's mouth and wasn't getting out the other nostril as it was supposed to. But, it seemed to help a bit, so we persisted, twice a day. It is now over two weeks, and we have all been sleeping through the night for the last 10 days or so, the irrigation goes very smoothly (have to remember to keep the head down and tilted to the side). A miracle!! The product works perfectly for now, but if it breaks, we will order it asap."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,3.0,"After reading the reviews of the other flavors I knew to expect the strange texture. I was, however, disappointed that the bars are basically just apple with added flavors. I honestly couldn't tell that these bars were any specific flavor. They were sweet, but if I had to close my eyes and guess the flavor I would have no idea. I do appreciate that they are all natural, no sugar added. That's what drew me to them in the first place. I was hoping for more real fruit (other than apple, although I know that is the cheapest and most used of all fruit for snacks). My son took one bite and wouldn't eat the rest. My daughter ate hers all gone. It's not bad, but nothing I would order again."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Bought one of these Fall 2008. It worked great at first and then started up with the ""F1"" & ""F2"" fault codes. Bought another one about 3 weeks ago and it worked for perhaps 15 total hours before it shut down with an ""F2"" code. Could not find the receipt to return it so I went back to Sunbeam. The Sunbeam local service center never picked-up their extension after I navigated through the menu. Their national number from on line was polite and helpful and are sending a replacement mod 902-505 to replace the mod 902-5 I recently got. Amazon lists both those model numbers on this product page??? Don't know what that is all about. Good luck to anyone buying this.Great if it works."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I have tried, I'd say, about 10 things in the past 4 years to get me regular and take solid dumps. I eat pretty well, but I always have this full and uneasy feeling after using the restroom. I think I have had constipation and I never feel that ""ahhhhhhhhh"" satisfied feeling after using the restroom, just discomfort and annoyance. I've tried mineral oil, pills, psyllium husk, fiber, and various other variations of the sort.I picked this product up, I kid you not, about 2 hours ago, and popped four pills in. Let me tell you something. I was laying down and I had this automatic feeling that came ovr me to go and use the restroom and I took one of those dumps where you feel damn good. No backup and honestly I feel happy that I did. It's been a good while since I've taken a dump like that. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is frustrated and lives on a day to day basis with that backed-up feeling. Purchase these. And they're natural. I wish you could post pics on this thing, but that would be gross and funny. But at least it could make all of you believers.DL"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,This coffee has a really nice aroma and good body. It's not overly strong and bitter but yet is bold and good flavor. The price is better than at the big club stores with free shipping and no tax.
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"My husband is a snorer and these block his noise out completely so I can fall asleep. One drawback is they tend to make your ears stinky by morning, but hey, we should all wash our ears more, right? I can't find these in stores anymore, so I have to buy online, but it's no problem. Accept no substitutes! Flents wax-cotton earplugs are great!"

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I am 34 and went off the pill December of '08 so my husband and I could TTC. I had been on the pill for 5 years. I also suffer from Vulvodynia, which makes intercourse painful. So knowing when to ""do it"" is better/easier for me than trying all the time.In January, I realized my cycle was about 36 days. I had no idea when I ovulated, but my period happened on day 36.In February, I tried OTC OPK tests, but they were hard to read and didn't give me any warning that I was about to ovulate-- only that I was ovulating. So, it was like we had one ""shot"" at making a baby. Obviously, I didn't conceive. Oh, and that month, my cycle was 35 days.So, I purchased this device after reading SO MANY SUCCESS STORIES. Of course, I planned to be one of those women who bought the monitor and got pregnant right away. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case.I love this monitor. It helps me keep track of my cycle (which is now down to 28 days). It's easy to use. I love that I also get several days a month of ""trying"" time as it gives 1-2 days of warning that ovulation is near and let's me know EXACTLY when I'm ovulating. So, though I'm not pregnant yet, I do know what's going on and when it's happening.There's just some kind of security in knowing that I do ovulate and when each month I have the best chance of conceiving. It has taken some of the guesswork out of the equation. I still have lots of questions like ""Why Not Me?"" and ""What's Wrong With Me?"" and ""When Will It Be Me?"" but these are answers only time and fertility testing will give. For now, at least I know I can count on not having to ask when I'm ovulating and when I should TTC because of this monitor. It really is worth the money.Sincerely,5 Months and Not Pregnant But Hopeful"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I read positive reviews here and my local grocer said he had heard positive comments from customers. So I purchased a bottle. Took it home, shook it up, poured a bit into a teaspoon and tasted it. Oh my, I nearly gagged. There was only the slightest hint of a chocolate/cocoa flavor. With a nasty after-taste. I then shook the bottle up well and tried again. No difference.I thought it might taste better if chilled and put on ice cream. So I tried that a few days later. Ugh! That was awful too. Couldn't finish eating the ice cream.Had my wife try it and she hated it. So I poured the remaining 95% of the contents down the drain and recycled the bottle. I honestly don't know how anyone can eat the stuff."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,My Doctor suggested I use Prilosec OTC several months ago and I found it to be a bit pricey. I purchased it anyway and found it to work really great. A short while later I got a email from Amazon and the price was less than half of what I'd already paid. Amazon had such a great deal with shipping included I purchased enough to last several months. My problems are gone! Thank you Prisolec and Thank you Amazon.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"myoplex is awesome. especially the powder myoplex. i add mine to my oatmeal, which i eat three times daily. it gives it a great flavor and adds protein to the already-amazing food. the reason i gave it 4 stars is because it contains whey and casein, so you have the quick and slow digesting proteins, allowing for a nifty balance, each time you add it to food. the reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it contains whey AND casein, making it difficult to use it for any specific purpose. we know that we should take whey immediately after a workout, because your body is craving proteins immediately so that it can begin repairs. casein, on the other hand, is good to take before you go to sleep, because the slow-digesting protein will assist in keeping your body from going into a ""fasting"" state overnight, and provide a prolonged release of essential building blocks for overnight repairs. this is also known to boost metabolism during sleep. also, this is one of the tastiest protein supplements you'll find, and contains tons of vitamins and nutrients to help you through the day, especially if you use portions of the packet throughout the day, like i do when i add it my oatmeal. also, if you intend to use the whole packet, for example-after a workout, it's a good way to moderate how much protein you take. lots of people will take a full dose of some protein supplements (as much as 50grams of protein!) immediately following a workout, and that's not necessary. your body can only take 25-30 grams of protein at a time, and this myoplex product has 25g of mixed whey and casein. if you took one immediately after your workout, and followed up with another one an hour or so after that, it would be optimal. all in all, great product, but if you're looking to get serious about the supplements you use, i recommend getting whey and casein in two separate products."

health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"This product is great, tastes great, and very good for protein at 12-13 gms. of protein, potassium, B-Complex, and now the manufacturer has just come out with ""an auto-immune"" component to this product, to keep one healthier,as the huge baby boomer population ages, slows aging, and prevents illness, keeps your mind and body strong, and its much better for you than a steak, or a burger or hot-tog by far!Try it, you may like it! and you shall like the taste of it too! Amazing. Stuart from Chicago, IL. June 4, 2009."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love Green Cream! I cannot wait until I can step up to level 9. In my opinion it works better than Retina Micro. After about a year of using it, my frown lines have virtually disappeared. I recommend not using too close to eye area, my eyes water profusely when I use it too close to the corners. I break out every once in a while, still, but that is to be expected with my age. Give it about 3 months to start seeing results. Great product for inbetween skin, acne and first signs of aging!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"this product was purchased for alleviating the symptoms of adrenal disease in my ferret, it has seemed to be ineffective. I do not blame the product but the advanced case in the animal. It would have been nice to have seen more accurate dosage info on the product (i.e., how many doses per bottle) and would also have been nice to have had less flavor additives."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"Best tasting light popcorn, period.Wish they sold it around here, but Amazon provides a good option."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I buy mine directly from the company. 10 lb. box is currently around 66 or 68 bucks plus 12 for shipping. The egg white protein has a really nice flavor without the addition of any toxic crap like aspertame that you'd find in many whey products. It's super cheap and tastes awesome. I'll use a 10 pounder every 2-3 months for the rest of my life as long as they don't go jacking the price too high. One scoop + frozen bananas + milk in the blender has been a twice a day ritual with me for 2 years now.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I ordered this pump because I was having trouble breastfeeding. I was using it once or twice a day. It worked great for about a week then it broke. It completely lost suction and was completely useless. Due to the failure of this product I had to purchase another pump. Not only do I not recommend this product, I would skip manual pumps all together! The electric pumps are far better and totally worth the money!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,I have been using this bread mix for over a year now and have not found anything that tastes better. It is the closest you can get to good bread texture and tastes somewhat like a grain bread. I recommend using a bread machine. Simple to prepare.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"The purchase of this latest box (April 2009) proved to be the end of my Amazon subscription for Chewy Chip. The price had been the best I could find, and while Chewy Chip wasn't my favorite flavor it had the best texture of any Pure Protein bar I'd tried- lighter and less dense than Chocolate Deluxe, for example. But in this batch the presence of an alcohol-like smell (perhaps from the sugar alcohol sweeteners?) was so strong as to smother my appetite for them."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I have to be thrilled at the saving I received with this product. There was a $16.00 saving and no shipping cost either. WHOOT!And in the last month of using Alli to help with my diet and exercise program, I have lost 21 lbs. DOUBLE WHOOT!Since I am using Alli as recommended there has not been any adverse side effects either.So this was a win-win situation for me.Promise I will be back to purchase more and continue on to my weight loss goals."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"As a vegetarian, I have enjoyed Worthington's Super Links for years. Last summer (2008), they became very difficult to find in ANY local stores and I got nowhere with the company when I tried to find a place to buy/order them. One day, I tried a search on Amazon, found them listed and before I could order, they were out of stock, much to my disappointment. However, Amazon was wonderful as they sent me an email to let me know they were back in stock, at which time I ordered a case. THANKS, Amazon!!!As for the product, we enjoy them broiled or grilled. They are simply the best tasting hot dog substitute on the market."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I bought these pills to be part of a weight plan program. I have been taken them for 3 days so the jury is still out, what I can say is that I have never felt better in my life. I do not feel bloated anymore. My stomach doesn't feel as dense. I do go more often but it is not rushed and there are no cramps. I have not upped the pills, am still only taking one in the morning and one at night, am afraid to take more and have an energency at work. I highly recommend these pills to anyone with digestive problems. I feel new. I can't wait to see how I feel two weeks from now. I will leave another review."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Product definately works. After a year of consistent exercise, I couldn't lose any weight. I've lost five pounds in the two weeks since I started taking Ripped Fuel and can see definate improvement in muscle definition, especially in my abs. I take two in the morning, two at lunch and none at dinner, since I don't want to risk losing sleep. This gave me jitters in the first few days but has since disappeared. My heartrate has not increased since taking this supplement. I also have not felt nauseous, dizzy, have blurred vision or any of the other side effects other reviewers have reported.However, I think you definately need to work out regularly for this to work. I hit the gym for 1.5 - 2 hours after work, five days a week. I have not changed my diet. I suspect if you improve your dietary choices (i.e., less fatty foods, more protein, etc.), you could lose more weight. I am thoroughly satisfied with the results I have seen thus far.Two (or so) months later"

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"Really? One star? If the spoon can get food in a hungry baby then it should at least get 3 stars. Our baby loves these spoons. They hold enough to finish a meal in a reasonable number of bites, but not so much that she spits half of it back out. She also loves to hold the rubberized grip herself and chew on the spoon."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I absolutely love this booster. I had one previously with straps to attach it to a chair, and once we got a table with benches instead of chairs, that no longer worked. I needed one that would not slide around everywhere. For me, this is perfect. My two year old can climb up on it herself, and it doesn't slip. I don't have to worry about her getting hurt. I have read reviews that say the material is easy to break off into pieces, and since it's sort of foamy I guess you could say that. We have had this for a few months now and nothing has broken off ours though. My kid doesn't pick at it or anything. It's really easy to clean as well, no nooks and crannies for crumbs. Plus it's super cute. I love this seat."

It said they were Tena pads and the package looked just like the Serenity Tena pads I have been purchasing but at half the price.These pads say ""Tena"" but not ""Serenity"".Shipment came immediately but it appears they are not as absorbent as the ones I had purchased previously.The package does say ""light"" though they are sold as ""heavy long"". They work fine but I find I have to use more.I would still use them but can not find the company from which I purchased them. I have the invoice but no web site. They are not listed on Amazon anymore."

Easy to apply, quick to relieve pain and soreness, and no medicinal smell makes this a winner. I will always have a tube of this product on hand for any muscular pain!!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans. I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I'm a member of the ""tried it all"" club. I have no idea how much money I've spent over the years trying to lose weight. I started using Alli on January 16, after a visit from my doctor. I have now lost 23 pounds, and I have even cheated pretty often - due to graduations, birthdays, etc. I just get right back on the wagon. It's actually hard to get negative results with Alli - I could not be happier with the product. And oh, yes, what you read about the ""effects"" can be true - but the good news is that you learn through better habits that you are in control of that aspect, too. Amazon rocks with the Alli prices - I've done the research -get it here because you won't find it for less, especially with the free shipping. Alli and Amazon have been a powerful tool for me in my quest to lose weight, finally."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have not tried this yet. I mostly bought to make sure I have plenty of food in case the economy goes south. I have been taking the pill form and they make me feel great. They come in the best packaging I have ever seen.
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"This tape sticks very well! Perfect for oily or sweaty skin. Does seem to irritate some skin though, so not recommended for the highly sensitive. The small 1/2"" compared to the 1"" does seem to help lessen the sensitivity. Overall, great value for the price."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I go through a ton of iced tea in the summer and I brew it in a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot. Twinings English (or Irish) Breakfast Tea tastes great! About four tablespoons in a coffee filter (with the top twisted shut and a second filter placed upside-down over it in the Pot) is juuuust right! Much more economical to use loose tea than tea bags. I've been buying it from here for the past couple of years.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,My husband and I were going to give up trying to conceive because of the frustration and disappointment that we were hit with every month. I found out about Pre-Seed online and thought it was worth a shot. It amazing only took one time during my fertile cycle and I was pregnant! It is nothing short of a miracle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to have a little bundle of joy!!

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"There are several ways to get enough fiber in your diet. The best, of course, is through your diet. This means more fruits and vegetables, and fewer fast foods and snack foods. The second is by using the 'bulking' fiber supplements that use the old standby, psyllium fiber. Psyllium fiber products such as Metamucil are effective, but many people don't like the gritty texture. After all, these products are ground-up seeds with the tiny seeds attached. The third way is to use a product such as Benefiber, which has a nice texture and dissolves almost completely in water or fruit juice, and is much easier to take/swallow.I'd suggest starting out slowly, adding a bit of Benefiber to your morning orange juice. Add a bit more every day or every other day, so you body can adjust to the increased bulk in your digestive tract.Our bodies were made to operate on a high-fiber diet. Native plants did not come as fruit leather or in popsicles. They came as whole fruits, fiber, vitamins and minerals and all of the other healthful products of raw fruits and vegetables.I do eat a healthy diet, but I still use added fiber. Why? The bulking makes me more regular, healthy, and I feel better. I believe it helps regulate fat and cholesterol in my body as well. It helps mimic the diets we humans evolved with on our planet.Recommended. I use this product all of the time. I still occasionally use the psyllium fiber products as well, just not as often since I've discovered Benefiber."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"The product repels mosquitoes well enough if you keep a fresh coat on. I would not expect an application to last longer than two hours. Otherwise, the product performs as advertised. If you combine use of it with permethrin on your clothes, you can stay bug free without the usual stink"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,I was excited to get this product for my 7 week old son. Once I got home the excitement went away. He would not suck on nipple and had no interest in it. Like many others i primed it by sucking on it then read the instructions. The milk did stay in the nipple but my son will only take the wide platex bottles and will not even attempt to drink from this one. This bottle would be great if my son would suck on it.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"You don't need to have SAD issues to love this lamp. Albeit a bit overpriced, it's something worth having. Tired to waking up to cloudy dark mornings, I got this lamp and a remote, so that I can turn it one without leaving the bed. This light is very bright, pretty well mimics the morning sunlight (at 4200k) rather than being too yellow (2700k) or white (5100k) or blue (6000k), and really gets your day started.I'd highly recommend it to anyone who simply doesn't happen to be living in a always-sunny state and have a bed next to a east facing window."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Granted, I buy this product from a local big box store rather than Amazon for under $30. But still, compared to other products out there this is the absolute best value I could possibly find. And it tastes great!I've tried chocolate and vanilla and they're both exceptionally tasty compared to others I've tried. I'd recommend vanilla if you like to add berries (delicious) and blend it.I add a scoop to a cup of skim milk every morning for breakfast, and slam a similar shake after every workout (2-3 per week) and a 5lbs. bag lasts me at least 6-8 weeks. With a piece of fruit, this makes an awesome breakfast that you don't have to gag on in addition to a post workout protein boost.Another benefit that was important to me is how great this product tastes while being so low on carbs (3g per serving).As with other protein supplements, this product has increased my gains while reducing recovery times, but its so nice to have such a cheap product that works fine and has an acceptable taste."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,4.0,"To my taste, Neera's ginger and pineapple chutney is not as successful as Neera's mango, peach, and pear chutneys. However, the ginger and pineapple chutney might be the perfect condiment for a food which the flavors of ginger and pineapple perfectly complement. Like all of Neera's fruit chutneys, the texture is chunky, the taste is fresh and nuanced, and the balance of spice and sweetness is perfect."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"This bar is one of my favorites. I love key lime pie. And it tastes just like key lime pie!It is truly amazing. There is no flour, sugar, eggs, chemicals, preservatives, or anything bad.There are only natural, healthy ingredients.This bar is suitable for vegans.This bar is suitable for health-conscious people or people on a diet.If you like key lime pie, but don't want to eat them because of all the bad stuff in them, then this bar should fill the bill and satsify your craving!!!!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"I'm trying to lose the last ten pounds of my baby weight from having two babies in the last two years and it has proven to be tough...Especially since I am a serious candy freak. These bars take care of my candy craving without overdoing the calories and they are absolutley, amazingly good. I certainly wouldn't reccomend eating them everyday if you're trying to lose weight but for those ""I need something sweet NOW!"" moments these are perfect."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"My husband loves these crackers, but we can't buy them anywhere in town anymore. Probably because they cost way more than any other wheat cracker, but they're way better than any other wheat cracker, so I don't mind the cost! The only thing is - they came in a huge box, about twice the size it needed to be, and there was no packing material in it. Hello... These are CRACKERS people. Not too badly broken, we saved the broken ones for casserole toppings, but I think the packing could have been better. Shipped super quick!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"After Breast Cancer related surgeries I got lymphedema in my right arm. I had to wear full arm compression sleeves and full gloves with fingers to keep my arm from swelling. I could only take the sleeve off for maybe an hour before my arm would ache and swell. Oncologyst, Primary Dr, and several therapists told me there was no cure for it and it was life long. A naturopathic Dr gave me Lymphomyosot and I have not wore my sleeves/gloves for about 8 months. I've given it to other people with lymphedema and they had the same success!"

He looks at me like I am crazy when I give them to him and he is really not a picky baby. Not sure if I will ever put anything but the ice chips because it would be really messy.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I use these neck packs in my acupuncture practice. Not only do I use them for the neck, but I also use them for feet, low backs, or any place that needs a little moist heat. They wrap around body parts nicely. My patients love the way they feel. I cover them with cheap towels. At least three layers of towel are needed,cause these babies get hot!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This was an amazon suggestion, and I'm so grateful I found this! I took it to a family reunion right after I got this and at least 4 other people want one too. What I love is the ability to control the pressure, and with this I'm able to work on areas like my shins that are tight but are very very tricky to roll out by lying on a foam roller. We've also discovered that this is great if you have very tight muscles in your neck and need constant deep pressure in a massage from someone else--but this helps avoid finger/hand tiring of the massager. Can't think of anything that would make this better. Easy to use, does what it says it will and should! (FYI, I had also tried a standard rolling pin--it didn't work very well...this is wonderful!)"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I've recently been placed on a very, very restrictive low-salt, low protein diet and rice is been my savior. I love crunchy things, so I've tried both the Unsalted Plain and the Veggie Low Salt crackers (from the same manufacturer) and found I like these Unsalted ones best. I've reordered the 12 pack three times now! I've doctored up my Tofutti (soy-based cream cheese) with jams and spices and used these crackers for breakfast, snacks, etc. A serving is 9 crackers and they're little bit bigger than a U. S. silver dollar. If you're looking for a lot of flavor in your crackers, this might not be the one for you--but to me it's just a crunchy delivery system!"

I AM JUST MAD I NEVER GOT ONE WITH MY 1ST CHILD. IT MIGHT NOT BE EDDIE BAUER QUALITY. BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I THINK IT IS WELL WORTH IT. I BABYSIT AND WILL BE GETTING A COUPLE MORE. EVERYONE SIT AT THE TABLE WITH HALF THE CLEAN UP."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This was recommended to me by a doctor to help during recovery from a hospital stay - Having lost the taste of coffee and not a fan at all of ""soft drinks"" I was hesitant to try this stuff- I'm glad I tried it - this stuff is great!It's in powder form (as well as a single capsule you take with it) so it's best to pour a few ounces of cold water into a cup THEN pour one scoop on top. I found that a simple spoon doesn't mix the powder well enough -so I use a small whisk .. Stir and drink - simple.I like the Berry the best - unlike most other ""delicious"" energy drinks you don't need a chaser - it's actually pretty good. The citrus isn't as tasty to me but I found that mixing some good orange juice (Florida - of course-) in (2/3 water/mix to 1/3 OJ) makes it pretty good. Reminds me of ""Tang"" from the 70's-After drinking the mix take the capsule and start the day - I always do this AFTER breakfast and after my other meds - this regimine works best for ME... You'll have to play around with it to adjust to your liking. The boost is nice- a nice alert non-cafeine type feeling - Besides the energy it turns my urine bright yellow - all day-Overall I like this stuff - it works great for me - I highly recommend it!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"For those of you who love Twinings Four Red Fruits, there is a reason why Four Red Fruits has been disappearing from store shelves. Twinings has recently changed this tea's name and packaging. It's new name is Mixed Berry. Mixed Berry is the same tea blend as Four Red Fruits; only the name has changed.Twinings USA sells this tea at a good price. [...]I recommend that you also try Blackcurrant Breeze (formerly Blackcurrant) and other Twinings flavors. Twinings has a wonderful line of black teas, herbal teas, and also rooibos teas.No, I don't work for Twinings of London. However I do love their teas!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"One of my friends clued me in on DGL after their doctor recommended it to them. I have, or now had, acid reflux. Using this product plus Bragg's apple cider vinegar I no longer need the Pepcid or Prilosec. There are tons of web sites that have nothing to do with advertising products or making money wherein people discuss their success with ACV and DGL. Sometimes lack of stomach acid disquises itself with the same symptoms as too much acid. I couldn't believe it but it worked for me. Do your research!!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,2.0,I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it.

I question the price they have here because I bought it for $19.99 at CVS. $99 seems like a pretty big mark up in price. I would highly recommend this unit, however I wouldn't purchase it from amazon for this price."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"Delicious creamy and chocolatey taste with just the right mouth feel. I like the moistness of the recipe, and that they are not overly sweet. We get no glycemic rush from these because they contain only whole and natural foods. I think they are a perfect meal replacement, trail snack or appetite-surpressing treat to have before meals. The flavor is superior to the flater taste of the Raw Revolution chocolate flavor without coconut."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"If i had to say i'd say this stuff works good, I was lifting in college and got up to 350 pretty fast for a max. I weighed like 220 was curling like 165 for 4-5 and doing the 60lb dumbbells for sets of 10!! Id say it works pretty well but i was also taking protein and bsn creatine and i push myself really hard!! When i lift thats pretty much all i do haha. It really does not taste good though, in fact one time i almost puked i have to say you have to drink it fast i developed a strategy where you kinda just swig swallow super fast other wise if you try to drink it regular you may YACK!! no joke.. But for me I'd say it did work for me."

health personal care,health care,diabetes,3.0,"I bought this (not this specific size, but the small wallet) from an independent website, other than Amazon, for my diabetic cat. The first time I used it, I misread the directions and activated it with cold water from the tap. I did this just as a test run without the insulin. It never got significantly cold, just barely cool to the touch. Yesterday, after noticing it says on the device to use 30 degree water, I activated it with water from the fridge. After approximately 6 hours, it was no colder than it was when I used tap water. It started off nice and cold but did not retain that temperature. I ended up buying a cup of ice and put the insulin in it. We were on a 11 hour trip. I don't know that I am really comfortable using this without maybe an additional frozen gel pack in a cooler. I would welcome any feedback, if maybe I am doing something wrong? But I am not satisfied with it thus far."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I am tempted to stockpile this product. It worked incredibly well for me. Much better than yogurt, enzymes, charcoal tabs, fiber , etc, etc.I have sufferd with IBS pretty much my entire adult life. My latest bout ( constant abdominal pain for 6 months) culminated with an endoscope showing nothing wrong. In desperation I tried this product. My ache was cleared in 2 days!I can now eat things I would never have dreamed of eating before.I can only hope it continues to work and that the company continues to produce."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Threelac is a life saver. I have had a bedsore on my buttcheek for many years. Nothing worked. But after taking threelac for three months, my sore healed up nicely. I started out taking Threelac for allergy and immune system. Little did i know that it also help my swollen joints and my nagging bedsore."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I really like the Ethipian coffee from Pura Vida and serve it to guests after dinner. I like it in the morning as well, although my daughter finds it too strong for the morning. Of the three that are shipped together this is my favorite and way better than the breakfast blend which I find a bit boring, yet a decent value."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,3.0,"I've used this case a couple of times for travel with insulin and diabetic supplies. It works as advertised and does a nice job providing plenty of room for Frio pouches in the outer mesh pocket. It's a bit pricey for what it is (a square black nylon bag with a mesh outer pocket and space inside for storage), however. Two other nits I have with this bag are"
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,1.0,"Squares changed color in the ""relaxed"" area but never saw it get to the ""stressed"" color. The ""calm"" reading did not match when a pulse monitor was used with it. Example-When the pulse rate went up the color on the square stayed the same. They are measuring two different things but both purport to measure stress."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,I love these pretzels and the Amazon price makes them even better. They are $8.19 in my local store so I gave up buying them until I found them on Amazon.They taste better than wheat pretzels to me. My GF kids love them too!
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,3.0,"I have used this monitor for 9 months total (one miscarriage in btwn) and this mnth it gave me HF earlier than expected so a few days later I used water on the test stick to see if its automatically telling me HF until I get an LH surge and sure enough the results were HF with WATER. So while I do believe it will recognize an LH surge, once it switches over to HF it will automatically stay there even if its not detecting any estrogen in your urine. Disappointing"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have been having problems with my elbow for about 6 months. A physical therapist told me of Biofreeze and recommended it. I am glad I bought it because it really works. When I start to have some pains, I rub it on and within minutes it begins to work. I highly recommend buying this product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This product is pure, unrefined. It's fresh and can be used in so may different things. I've used it in cooking and baking, I use it in my hair, my skin as well as taking a teaspoon of it daily. You really get a lot for your money. Without a doubt, I will order this again. The seller even included a letter...which i s very personable. They not only want to see you a product, they have your best interest at heart!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I was really excited to find these-- I lived in India and this was a staple at my school. Really great in curry. They truly are delicious and meaty, plus I've never seen them in the United States. The price was right (2.39 for a 1-lb bag). I put 5 bags in my cart, went to check out, and was shocked to find that the shipping cost over $15. Really? More than $3 a bag???? What a rip off!!!!! I can't believe that nobody else mentioned this in their review. I'm going to call the company and find out what the deal is, and if it's a different story, I'll update."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"For years my husband and I took multi-vitamins in pill form, but never really noticed feeling any better. I read about the absorption advantages of liquid vitamins and tried several. We continued taking Balanced Essentials as the flavor was preferable to the other liquids. After three months, we were surprised at how much better we felt and how much more energy we had throughout the day. We have now been taking this product for over a year and are very pleased with the results!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,Special K and Slim Jim's live up to their advanced billing. They're simply delicious and Special K is also nutricious. They both are tasty and add pleasure to my day.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"The major complaint for this product is that it is pricey. You need to start taking three capsules a day for one or two months and then you can drop down to two a day. Depending on where you get them (Costco has a better deal) they are about 25 to 30 cents each. The reason you want to try this product is that the ingredients are of a very high quality. If glucosamine-chondroitin is going to work for you, and it doesn't work for everyone, then you should try this one first. It it works, then you can try the cheaper ones. The problem with all food supplements is that their quality is not regulated by the FDA, so you never really know what you are getting. Cosamin DS at least has been peer reviewed and has multiple professional recommendations. Try this one first."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I expected this to taste awful like all the other ""so called"" green antioxidants. I was surprised, it is not bad at all. I even started using some Stevia Root Beer or Vanilla drops in with it. Have only used it a couple of days so really can't say yet if I feel a difference with it yet."
health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,I purchased this product to help with peri-menopause symtoms- I am 45- as well as symtoms from fibroids. I have used it two months and found that it has helped with breakouts and a few other symtoms. I will continue to use it as most research I have done says it takes about 4-6 months to really see a difference. I have tried other brands in the past and this one is working more quickly than the others.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,The Raspberry is the best flavored iced tea. Easy to make and so delicious!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,It is a very good product because it really relives pain.Also you recieve a generous amount of product and it last quite long.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I use this as the base for a fabulous oven baked delight. I never just use the soup alone...I toast up an english muffin or some nice crusty bread and put it on top of an oven safe cup of the soup, shred some cheese over the whole thing, bake for 10 min...and YUMMM!If you want an easy french onion soup, this is it. It's also organic and makes you feel a bit better about what went into it in the first place."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"THIS RASPBERRY ZINGER TEA IS LIGHTER THAN THE WILDBERRY ZINGER BY JUST A BIT AND IS VERY REFRESHING AND DELICIOUS. I USE 7 BAGS IN MY MR COFFEE ICED TEA MAKER AND IT THE PITCHER OF TEA TURNS OUT PERFECT! I WILL BE SURE TO TRY ALL THE OTHER CELESTIAL SEASONS ZINGER TEAS, BUT SO FAR THE WILD BERRY ZINGER IS GREAT AND THIS RASPBERRY ZINGER IS EVEN BETTER, AS I AM PARTIAL TO RASPBERRIES."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"I have tried many different brands of Spanish rice, including Goya, and this is the best. I can't find in the grocery stores where I live (MD) even though the stores carry every other packaged Mahatma product. That is why I try to remember to get some whenever I order something through Amazon."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This product is really great! I love it! I use it on my skin and my scalp and in my hair. It really does absorb fast. I was worried because when I opened the jar and took a whiff, it smelled like grease...so I was hesitant to try it on my skin. I rubbed it between my hands then apllied to my skin and it smelled heavenly. It smells like a creamy coconut. I love it! I just wish it would smell that way before it melts, but I love it! My hair is so soft, my scalp is nice and dandruff free and my skin is soft and supple...not to mention smells so great!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Girls . . . You will love this product. I have been using this on my face as a base for 20-years now . . . Even though I am now 58, I am very youthful looking. It is wonderful. This product not only is good for the skin because it is Vitamin-E but it also repairs and keeps your face from getting dry. I highly recommend this product."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"A friend recommended this to me over the boppy, and I didn't want to spend the money initially. But I'm so glad I did - the pillow doesn't slide or fall off, and the little pocket is perfect for holding a pacifer or a watch for timing feedings. I also love that it's adjustable as I shed the baby pounds. I highly recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,Bought this as a filler. It is easy to prepare and tastes good. Tastes even better with milk and coffee. Considering buying this again.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,Fantastic! Spices are fresh and full of flavor. Arrived intact and on time. One goof in shipment was corrected immediately. I will be buying from them again. Thanks!

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have used mobisyl for quite a few years, and it is great after being very active or in sports and working out. I have even used it recently when I sprained my ankle, and I put some on the area, and wrapped it in an ACE bandage and it took the swelling down. I still had to rest and ice as well as elevate to get the results I received.Patty MelendezAustin, Texas"

health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,Excellent product for everyday use. We needed it for our daughter when traditional wipes--with lotions and scents--would not work. They were perfect! Gentle on her skin and able to absorb and hold messes. Hospital quality materials.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"They aren't as good as I expected having had other enjoy life snacks, but they aren't bad. They are small but dense, with a decent taste. Not bad product to have in on the road or in between meal snack if you have food allergies/intolerances or eat gluten free."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"More Milk Plus is an amazing product! I just started using it about a week ago after my milk supply suddenly dried up (I was getting only a few drops at each pumping and my baby was clearly not getting anything either). After a few days of using this product, I am now pumping 3-4 ounces and my baby is happy too! I just returned to work and I'm now confident that I'll be able to pump enough to keep up with my baby each day. The only downfall of this product is the taste (yuck!) and the fact that you cannot drink liquids 20 minutes before or after a dose. I will be trying the pills after I run out of this because I can't stand the taste. Definitely worth every penny though!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"When I opened the box on this unit I know it was a really cheap item. We have gone through several peak flow meters and this is by far the worst.It was covered by insurance, but it won't work properly the tab doesn't move accurately. My fear is that someone who is just learning about asthma will get a hold of this horrible item and they won't be able to accurately tell what is happening with their peak flow. I'm throwing it away and paying for a high quality one."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,oils,5.0,"This is the worlds best Italian dressing. I use it for salads, marinate fresh vegetables in it and marinate sliced roast in it wich tenderizes the meat and makes it taste like a juicy steak. I love it but it is hard to find!! So Glad to find it while shopping on Amazon!!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have noticed a marked improvement in my joints. I don't have many aches and pains anymore and even seem to have more energy. I used to be very stiff when I got up to walk. No stiffness anymore. Even my sciatica has been better. I work 12 hour shifts and most of the time I'm on my feet. This product has made all the difference in my work week. I take 400mg a day. My mother and sister have begun to take it too. I'll also add that I do take B vitamins. I have found Nature Made to be a brand I can trust.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is the only way to get the benefits from Green Tea. The blend of spices is so good. I like it iced with Truvia. Easy to drink and refreshing. A great tea to take on the go. Can't say enough. I found it at my local Albertson's Grocery, but am anxious to use the convenience with Amazon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Kashi makes very good products, such as cereals, but this is the first Kashi bar I tried. It is simply stunning - best tasting bar I've ever tried - and I've tried a lot of them.Not only is it tasty but it also has very good nutritional values. It is filling enough to count as a full breakfast (180 cals), has low fat, high protein and fiber (compared to most other bars).The taste is out of this world, especially the almond one. The bottom layer of chocolate is what makes it special too - it's a party in my mouth.Bought mine at Costco, same 24 pack as here on Amazon, and I'm pretty sure it was cheaper, though I'm not sure how much.I highly recommend these, you will not regret purchasing Kashi."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I have a dog I adopted from Golden Retriever Rescue. He was known to have serious and constant allergies when I adopted him. I immediately put him on benadryl, which helped significantly. This was in Aug 2007. Over that winter, he did fine. When summer 2008 came, he needed not only an increase in his benadryl dose, but also monthly cortisone shots.This spring, I talked to my vet about this. She suggested putting him onto Clemastine Fumarate (Tavist) instead of benadryl. He has done fabulously well. His allergies always start getting bad as soon as it stops freezing over night, then get even worse as plants start blooming and summer is in full swing. Well, it's July 2009, and he still hasn't needed a cortisone shot. This is a huge benefit for his future health, since cortisone has significant long-term detrimental effects. And of course it's good for his short term quality of life because he's itch free!Furthermore, finding generic Clemastine Fumarate online has saved me a bundle. If you decide to buy this product, look for a good price. Amazon has the best price I can find. Other sites have it available, but for as much as 3 times the price on Amazon."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"These are great cups. They don't leak and they last a long time. I know they cost a little upfront but they are well worth the price. If you are trying to decide between these or Gerber sippy cups, these will last a lot longer. I bought a Gerber cup first and it only lasted 6 or 7 months at the most. the little plastic rubber insert to keep it from leaking tore and then became unusable. Then I thought I would try a different brand so I bought a Playtex cup and it has lasted now for two and half years still being used. My children use these everyday and they are great! I did go back to try a Gerber brand again and still it didn't last long. We have washed them in the dishwasher and it didn't seem to affect them at all. I haven't tried any other brands as these have lasted so well there was no need."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Two weeks before my scheduled colonoscopy, I started a routine of lowering my normal food intake and beginning the colon cleansing with this product in hopes that the final cleansing on the day before the procedure would be easier.To my pleasant surprise, in contrast to my expectation of some gut discomfort or even distress typical of over-the-counter laxatives, this product produced no discomfort whatsoever--not on the first day or any day thereafter. The morning following my first application proved the gentle efficacy of the product.I continued taking Colon-X capsules till two days before my scheduled colonoscopy when I began the physician's orders for other products.For those of you facing this procedure, I recommend your ""easing"" into it by starting these capsules, then following your physician's orders. The dreaded day before the colonoscopy will become less dreaded and easier on your system if you do. I hope you have the successful results I did.____FOLLOWUP COMMENT:My colonoscopy was so easy because of the efficacy of this plus other preps the physician ordered. In fact, I asked for a minimum of anesthesia and actually watched the last half of the procedure on the screen. Because I was not heavily sedated, I joked with the staff I was ready for a game of tennis--and, actually, I think I could have played a set right then. Instead, I returned to work that afternoon.I hope my comments relieve you of some of the anxiety normal with pre-op procedures and the colonoscopy itself. Following all pre-op directions is crucial for your success!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My doctor recommends these Vitamin D's...he even sells them at a discount in his office. The deal I found through Amazon still beats his price!These are the easiest and purist forms of Vitamin D that I have tried. Highly recommend.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"The much touted health benefits of xylitol made me buy this product. It is a huge amount of sugar in a very fine, powdery form.I deduct one star for the misleading label which makes everyone think it is a protein powder. It should be marketed as a healthy, organic product rather than something which looks like a genetically engineered ""get-big-quick"" supplement."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I love this mix because I've been able to use it to recreate some old family recipes, the ones Grandma would make for us as kids which I have such fond memories of. Who could ask for more than that? It doesn't have any bean flour in it so it doesn't have that aftertaste that is common in other mixes. There are some great recipes on Pamela's Website as well, especially the one for Cornbread. It really taste good to mix butter(or margarine) with some roasted pecans and a little honey as a topping for it. It makes really good pancakes too. The bread recipe makes a nice loaf, but I would consider it a desert bread, so although it does ok even if it isn't toasted, it's not really good for sandwiches, but it does work very well when you spread jelly or a chocolate/hazelnut spread on it. I buy this from amazon, it's a great price esp compared to the local health food store."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"Unless you expect a suction cup to work as well as crazy glue, you'll probably be very happy with these bowls. Obviously, the stick better on plastic and smooth surfaces, and they stick better if you wet the suction cup. One review said that she licked the rim, but I just wet my finger or run the bottom of the bowl under the sink. If they stuck too well, I would think it would be frustrating when you want to move it and have to get a fingernail under there or something. To the reviewer who said that it is probably a better idea just to train your child not to throw things on the floor, I say, that's the right idea.On the flip side, the bowls really help kids learn to spoon feed since they can scoop things up the side of the bowl. Having a relatively deep bowl is important for that. One problem with the bowls is when you are at a restaurant and the high chair is not very high in comparison to the table so the child is peering over the edge of the bowl.I use them with the sassy spoons with the handles that curve up like a hill. My 17 month old can eat cereal with milk using those spoons with these cups and most of it goes into her mouth!"

Even though I rehydrated it according to the directions on the bag, it just dried out again. Storing it double bagged did not help either."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This product is great, exactly what we were looking for. The size is plenty big enough for my husbands size 13 feet. I love that this product heats the water. My one wish is that there was an automatic shutoff once the water gets to a certain temperature. My husband has little sensation in his feet and does not realize when it gets too hot. Otherwise this is perfect for our needs."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,4.0,"I was unable to find these in my local stores anymore and loved the convenience of shopping from Amazon.com. If you are a berry lover, these are the bars for you. The Raspberry and Strawberry flavored fruit pieces with the currants are delicious. Great snack for the on the go person for only 140 calories."

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"The mask is comfortable and true to the product description your eyes don't feel a thing. It also has a velcro in the back of the strap which must be so that it can separate without choking you, because the velcro is too small for size adjustments.My major quibble with the mask is that it leaks in a lot of light around the nose area because of the contours. There is undoubtedly someone out there that this mask would fit and it would be a fantastic product for that single person. Unfortunately, that person is not me, nor is it my girlfriend."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is a great caffeine free tea that tastes like a black tea. I always used to buy it in the stores and have been having trouble finding it. Makes a wonderful iced tea.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"Boy, are these great! They are especially nice if you have children since they're very easy to chew and they don't rip the inside of your mouth. They have a wonderful butter taste and quite frankly, ever since I've tried these, I don't buy anything else! Highly recommend!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is a great flour substitute. I use it in all my recipes and just sub this for wheat flour. It works as an even exchange 90% of the time. The only problem I have had has been with making breads but I am sure that if I put more work into it I could make it work. I have used it for cookies, waffles, muffins, etc. I have bought this product many times."
health personal care,health care,stimulants,5.0,"I bought this produt Jan of this year and I love it. I am kind of person who does not believe in all this but when I tried I had to believe that there is something which is always supporting me and keeping up with my energy. Before wearing it I would be scared to go to stores like Walmart or Shopping Malls because of how the things smell there and becuase of going there will drain my energy for the rest of the day so if I go to these places either I make a quick run or I will go in the evening so I have only this last thing to do but now since I have this shield with me, I can go anytime of the day and dont feel tired or stressed out at all...this is just one small example there are many of them. I also feel drained when I meet some negative evergy people or when I have argument with my spouse but now I feel stable, not loosing control of myself and more grounded. I am not jewellery person so I cant wear it in my neck all the time so I either keep in my pockets or insert it inside my bra and it works pretty well. I love my shield. [...]~Lakshmi Singh"

I wanted to get rid of the calories, so I tried this.There's no doubt that it works, but THE GAS is horrible. This is my 10th day and it has NOT gone away. I'm giving it only 12 days, then I have to quit because it's just awful.The product does work, but the side effects...yikes!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,1.0,"First of all, beware of websites that only post glowing 5-star reviews for their product. These vitamins are NOT what I expected. They have a very strong fish-like smell makes me feel sick to my stomach every time I open the bottle, and worse they leave that same TERRIBLE taste in my mouth as I try to swallow them. They are advertised as being easy-to-swallow, but even without the nasty taste they are a bit bigger than I expected, and they have a wide shape that doesn't help them to go down. And supposedly they contain ""no artificial dyes or colors"", and yet titanium dioxide is listed in the ingredients list, which is a color additive."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,Excellent product. Clean and refreshing taste and works great replacing electrolytes after Bikram Yoga!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"I love Drostes cocoa. We have many food allergies and cannot use the prepared baking chocolate, so I bake with cocoa. There is a huge difference between Drostes and the other brands. When I take baked items (usually brownies that are out of this world) to events, I label them to let others with food allergies what the ingredients are. Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my brownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"I do not like the pasta and sauce as much as I like the NOODLES and Chicken Sauce. It was my fault that I did not read the whole nine yards so to speak. The fettucini is not my favorite. I will double check next time to make sure it is EGG NOODLES. But it is not all bad, and I am sure I will be able to consume the whole lot. Thank you for asking!Joan Rusnak"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"The price definitely worths it. This coffee is pure crema. The flavor is in its point. The texture is unparallel. If you gather with friends to share good espresso shoots or lattes, this is the bean you must acquire.Suggestion"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,5.0,"This water is exactly what it promises to be... and I loved the crisp/refreshing pear taste, which was actually stronger than I was led to believe by previous reviewers! It's definitely a pear taste, not just an aftertaste, but it's a delicious and mellow one, not overpowering - and very natural tasting. Looking forward to seeing Hint's newest flavors on Amazon, especially Hibiscus Vanilla!"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"We take care of my 86 year old mother-in-law. The ease of placing our order on line, the quick shipment and the price to have the quality at our doorstep makes this a great protection product for her use. I simply re-order when I get down to one package and she never runs out. The product is great for her full time protection. Night or day, she can maintain her activity level without letting the incontenance issue stop her."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"The product is great, but the summer shipping is an issue, as these must have sat in a hot truck or warehouse, as they were melted and solidified again, so they kind of fell apart and make quite a mess when opened. Amazon, you need to work on summer fulfillment of perishables."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I am an mma athlete and purchased these as a supplement.one thing I noticed, is that it is probably a bad idea to take them before cardio or high intensity workouts. some of the vitamins in this supplement stimulate blood flow (mainly the niacin). I would find that taking these before training made me feel overheated, like really my body was too hot.so I switched to taking these only before lifting, where it really displays its potency. No kidding this stuff allows you to lift to your full potential every day. I honestly feel like it really does help.On a pharmaceutical level, the supplement contains borderline high amounts of the fat soluble (stays in your system longer and can accumulate) vitamin A. Just be careful.It contains no iron, also, but most people get enough iron in their diets.People complain ""ohhh, this is too many pills to take and the pills are just wayyyy to big"". hey shutup. you work out for an hour? or do whatever sport you do? and you cant take like 11 pills or whatever is in a packet to up your game? please. its really not a big deal. takes like a minute to consume."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"This is a crunchy, wonderfully tasty bar! Coconut and almond flavors blend to create something wonderful! You won't be disappointed with these. They're on my shopping list for regularly delivery."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"Mine just didn't work with this pump. It wasn't operator error - it worked, it just didn't work well, and it didn't work equally well on both breasts (one is larger). I had to go with an electric, and even then I still would have been better off with a variable shield."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,These bars are awesome.This is my favorite flavor...This is the best price you will find anywhere.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I felt compelled to write about this product. It worked so well, I was awake, extremely alert and had no jitters. I flew through an exam at school with flying colors too. Be prepare to be awake for 6 or 10 hours."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,I bought this because I did not want to pay so much for a pump. It really does work quicker. The only negative is that it does one breast at a time.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,Love this granola over fruit and yogurt. Haven't been able to find this variety in my supermarket lately. Pleaase continue to carry the cranberry .
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"this really is a great product if you take it regularly. I am a busy mom of a 2 and 4 year old, so I can only workout a few days a week. I notice if I have been taking the CLA I get much better results from my workouts over time. I am also very sensitive to any stimulants, and this doesn't give me any of those feelings."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Brewer's Yesat is alleged to be full of viatamin A. However, I use it to add a delightful full-bodied, ""toasteded"" flavor to many of my breads"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,3.0,"I tried this because of all the great ratings on amazon. However, I took it once a day for 3 weeks and didn't notice much difference. Then I took it twice a day for 3 weeks and still didn't notice much of a difference. Align worked better for me."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I never write reviews but I was so pleased with this product I decided to write this. I tried many different nursing covers and my little girl was trying to rip the cover off in public because she loves to look around and she didnt like it covering her face it was very distracting and uncomfortable to nurse. This cover made all the differnce, now I can get a good latch without having to remove my hand to lift the top of the cover to look in. My baby girl can look up at me and still has an aerial view she no longer tries to pull the cover off and its light and breathable so goo for warm weather. The fabric is light and soft. I also throught it on my baby while she naps. The gorgeous patterns are an added bonus I own the nursing cover in 3 patterns. Great to give for baby showers. For me its worth the price, which is not much more than other nursing covers that are not nearly as good."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"If you love chocolate and mint together, you'll love this! I just started eating them, but recently noticed that they have a warning on the label that states they may contain traces of peanuts or tree nuts, so unfortunately we will not have them in our house any longer as my daughter has a severe peanut allergy."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,"I've done some research and I think this is a very good product for overprotective parents like myself who want to make sure that their children get perfect nourishment even after being weaned or reaching age one. The drawback is that the formula tastes like pond scum. I really nearly vomited when I drank it, but my daughter didn't seem to mind it. I'm sure the DHA is what gives it the fishy taste. If the idea of it disgusts you, don't buy this product and instead feed your child flax meal and wild salmon (or similar DHA foods) if they're ready. That's what we ended up doing. Feeding our daughter whole milk after age one was a lot easier than mixing the formula and was a whole lot more practical."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"This is a good little drink when you're in a hurry in the morning or rushing to go out for the night. I take my vitamins with it in the morning, something more than just a glass of water. The extra Vitamin C is a plus.The sencha shots are just that, something quick. It has a nice, clean taste, but not exactly something that I'd take my time to ""sip and savor"". There can be some bitterness, similar to oversteeping tea.Shipping wasn't too bad. Out of 30 cans, 3 cans were slightly dented.PROS:Vitamin CGreen tea benefitsCute ""on the go"" sizeCONS:Sometimes a bitter tastePricey for the size (but worth it)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"do not buy here- they are overcharging- you can get them at lunas website box of 15 for 10 $ less, although i will say htis- this flavor- white chocolate macadamia and nuts ver brownie are the best 2 i have tried. the lemon one they sent in the mail was borrible!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,1.0,Made no difference to my hapless sleep pattern - I had high hopes after reading the reviews but found it didn't work for me - my husband and I shared the bottle and he sweetly suggested it 'might' have made a difference.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"These deteriorate before I can get them in mouth. I usually put my vitamins in a daily container a week ahead of time. However, these tablets start deteriorating before I can take them. The pills should have a coating on them to prevent that. I don't have high humidity or heat & all my other vitamins hold up just fine."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Try it at Starbucks first and you will be hooked... then you will be buying it by the case like I do. It's as addictive as a non-caffeinated beverage can be!Herbal Infusion Tea-Passion (Decaf) - 20 - Bag
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"great product! just have to remember to use it regularly! would prefer a massage therapist, but this one is relatively free!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,4.0,This is definitely the way to spice up plain old popcorn. For these popcorn seasonings I would recommend plain popcorn. Do not use any buttery popcorns because the butter flavor is too strong and takes away from the sweeter seasonings.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,1.0,"Maybe it was the batch I received or maybe it was just my taste that day, but these are some of the worst nuts I've ever had. They put WAY too much seasoning on them and seem to overcook them to have this slightly burned taste on top of a horrible flavor. If you like intensely flavored nuts...and by intense I mean on the verge of throwing up...then these might be for you. If not, then I recommend you stay away from this product!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Since I have a cup of Celestial Seasoning Chai Tea every morning, I was very upset when I could not find it in any market where I shopped. Couldn't even find it at Celestial's own site. But Amazon had it and that made me happy once again. I plan to have it sent at regular intervals from now on."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I can understand why some people can't stand the taste of this stuff -- there is a bit of an aftertaste behind your tongue. But I guess I'm just not that picky about such things -- all things considered, it tastes just fine to me. Nice thick chocolate flavor and only 6g carbs -- well worth the ""flavor tradeoff"" in my opinion.I will definitely be buying more of this1"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm very health conscious and this tea was recommended by my cardiologist. She stated that drinking organic hibiscus tea supports a healthy heart while lowing bad cholesterol!! I did not hesitate to buy for the cause of healthy habits. This tea which was drank without cream and sugar of course, was tart and flavorful. The tea being certified organic was a plus but it's really about the taste and health benefits. The color of the tea was red (lemongrass I was clearly thinking a lighter color) was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this company and product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have found this protein powder to be actually quite good tasting. Mixed with some milk, and put through a blender, it is almost as tasty as regular chocolate milk. I have also drank it with water, and it is not bad tasting that way either, although milk enhances the taste very much.I think it is best to use a blender to achieve the best results. No matter how much you mix it with a spoon, the powder will not blend with the milk as well as if you use a blender.As for its effectiveness, I can vouch for it. It is a good source of protein.I am on my second tub now, and I will continue buying more because it is just that good."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I am always on the look out for soy free food and when I found this at my grocery store I literally screamed with excitement. Truthfully these aren't as good as saltine crackers, but hey, they're made with better ingredients and soy free. I ordered these from amazon and I'm very disappointed with how they held up in shipping. I generally end up with about 15 whole crackers and the rest ranges from 3/4 of the cracker to a crumb per box. I can't recommend getting these delivered to your door unless your area doesn't have them stocked at the grocery store."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"We received the item and very disappointed! We received a faulty screw- didn't have a hole in the center so the allen wrench AND one of the sides was the wrong panel! We were supposed to received a side A and side B and we received two side As. UGHH! Horrible QC on the manufacturer! And with safety as #1 for my little son, this is one of the MOST disappointing products I've ever bought on Amazon, and I buy ALOT from Amazon. I'm writing Amazon to let them know. Terrible."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This bag is fantastic. I have bought two so far. However, I do wish the manufacture would correct the malfunctioning zipper."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I rarely review items, but this is one of my favorite teas. This is similar to many orange spice teas out there, but is milder in taste. None of the spices are overbearing, but combine beautifully to create a refreshing tea."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,2.0,"This is far from the best tasting energy drink. I don't care for the taste much at all. It is like drinking ground up aspirin with a little fruit flavor. They are expensive and you have to buy at least a case. If you can't find a place to buy just one first, I recommend passing this one up."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Good taste. I ordered it as a snack and ended up eating it as a lunch.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Bought this coffee in October, 2007. Really liked its smooth coconut creme flavor. Just right, not too weak, not too strong. Amazon doesn't always seem to stock this and/or doesn't always have a great low price. So I check back often."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This is a great product, works as advertised, but is pretty slow heating. This product works best if you're going out with a cold bottle and know when you're going to feed your child. For example, our town is 25-30 minutes away, so we start warming the bottle in the car on the way to town so that it is finally ready once we get to our destination."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"Tinkyada pasta is fantastic! It's the only kind I buy. It's made with whole grains, so it's healthy like whole-wheat pasta. But it has the texture of refined-white pasta. (I don't like the grainy texture of whole-wheat pasta.)I highly recommend this product!---------[...]"
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,5.0,I asked shipper if he could send quickly as I was going out of town. He sent the next day! He was great! Will definitely order from him again.
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,4.0,"I used a boppy with the first two, and now I'm using My Brest Friend with my 6 week old son. It's much better than the boppy. The boppy never seemed to be in the right place for support. I would end up using several pillows around the boppy to support myself. The back support of My Brest Friend and the adjustable strap make it totally comfortable. As a mom of two preschoolers as well as a newborn, I sometimes have to get up and walk around while he's nursing, and it's great that the pillow stays in place instead of dropping to the floor. It also makes for more comfortable nursing in the hospital (when you have to nurse on a hospital bed) and in the car (when you don't have any other pillows around you).My only complaints are that the silent release buckle isn't always silent, unless you press it just right -- I guess I haven't learned the trick of it yet. Also, the cover is not as easy to wash and put back on as the boppy. I still sometimes use an extra pillow underneath the side I'm nursing on for extra support, but it's not as needed as it was with the boppy."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"We have used this product successfully for nearly two decades. It is easy to use (crush the glass vial inside the plastic dispenser; swab green fluid on sting site) and provides immediate relief from the pain of an insect stings for adults, children, and grandchildren. You may have difficulty finding it in stores. Wal-Mart allegedly carries it. I gave up and ordered 4 cards via amazon.com.IT WORKS ! ! !"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I bought my pump on June 20 & was delivered on July 3, it took some time since it's was shipped to Philippines. I was so happy that it was delivered before the committed date.I gave birth on July 8 & was able to use it the following week. From the very beginning, I was having a hard time turning it on and you have to find the right connection spot of the power supply (both wall plug & battery pack)& the control handle which made it more difficult & made me spend more time since I have to turn it on again & again. It's less than a month since delivery but I can't believe I was having problems already. Now, I can't totally use it anymore. I've been an Avent believer & user from my 1st born child, but this was the 1st time I have encountered difficulties with an Avent product. When I reported my concern to Avent Philippines, all i got was an apology for the inconvience & was asked to bring my pump to their service center for repair however they don't honor international warranty. To my dismay, i just bought another pump Medela's Freestyle and I'm so happy with it."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I think if you need a gluten free diet this bar is for you. But if you can eat wheat, I prefer Zone Bars (Mint) better. I bought these after all of the good reviews but when I ate it-it didn't taste like white chocolate at all and the texture is a little gross (sorry). It also is good for fighting hunger, but so are Zone Bars so I think I will stick with them."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,This chips are super yummy! I don't buy them on Amazon because.. that is pretty weird. But I do buy them at my WalMart and I love them! They really are really yummy.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I love this product. In fact I LOVE this entire line. You must be careful when you buy your supplements. This is a line you can trust. [...]
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,1.0,I purchased this item to help with my husband's snoring. We were going broke buying the nasal strips and throat spray. Well we are back to going broke on the nasal strips and throat spray because the Nozovent will not stay put.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,This product shipped very fast. We have already placed a second order with the company because the product is high quality and great price. I spent alot of time shopping around and could not beat the prices they offered. Will continue to buy this product from the same company.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Product was delivered promptly, however, the shipping cost were a bit high (almost equal to the price of the product)."

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,3.0,"The swiveling lid binds with time, as it picks up fine dust from the vitamins within. The dispensing hole is way too small to allow the pills to fall out. First thing you must do is enlarge the hole - double or triple size. You can't make it too large. The cap needs a flange to make it more easily removeable. You must grab and pry the lid off now when it's time to refill a column. It works, and I haven't found one better, so you're stuck with this one. Given a choice to buy it or not, I'd buy it again until a better design comes out. One good thing about this one is each section holds many pills - in contrast to most others. This is still my favorite."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"My wife was given this ointment for an ankle sprain some 10 years ago at a medical clinic while vacationing in Italy. Thank God its finally becoming available in the USA. A most reliable homeopathic topical ointment / anti-inflamatory that is oily but with no analgesic scent, and consistantly relieves both muscle strain, tendonitis and arthritic pain."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,These are very good but hard. I have a soft mouth so I add a little juice or tea and wait 10 minutes. They soften up very well.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,1.0,"Gross, not even worth the purchase. I ended up throwing 2 jugs of this stuff away after using it for a week. Don't buy this, there are much better products on the market for equal price."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I am thrilled with this nursing cover! I have tried about three others and none have given me the coverage I want. The Bebe Au Lait provides the coverage I need and looks great. I have also used it as a sunshade for the baby when outside. The strap makes everything much more convenient.I have washed it several times and it has not shrunk at all. worth every penny!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I love this coffee and have it shipped on auto delivery. I was always searching for a substitute for ""Snickerdoodle"" and this is the closest I have found. The Cinnamon Nut flavor is wonderful and doesn't taste artificial. The four-bag purchase also affords me the benefit of giving some as a gift, which I like to do as a hostess gift and also stocking stuffers at Christmas."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"Most Optimum Nutrition protein powders I've used tasted good and mixed very easily. For some reason the Natural Whey Vanilla does not mix well,left with big clumps,and doesn't have much flavor."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"This placemat works very well; it catches most of the food that doesn't quite make it into our one-year-old little guy's mouth. Cleaning the floor isn't such a chore now. The suction cups work... we have a farmhouse-style tile-top kitchen table...just don't put the suction cups on the grout lines. No bad plastic smell. It rolls up easily and neatly for travel. Washes fine in the soapy sink with all of his other stuff... one particularly messy incident with pasta and marinara sauce did stain it a bit, but this has faded now over several uses and washes. Highly recommended. Caveat"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"You just have to make sure you select the size of the bottle, then hit the ""on"" button(It says to do this right on the adapter). Otherwise you'll sit there waiting for it to warm up the bottle, and it won't. But it heated up a 4 oz bottle in about 10 minutes. It automatically shuts off after like 5, so we had to restart it, but it was well worth the money."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"It's always a risk when you can't see the whole ingredient list before you buy. Just so you know, the flavor packet does contain hydrolyzed gelatin - so it's not totally vegetarian. But if you can live with that, there are no meat flavors in it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This is a very well built table, easy to set up and light weight to easily move around. Adjusting the height is done by removing a portion of the leg and re-installing it over a threaded bold with a threaded handle, simple but you must lay table on its side to do it easily.I am 6'3"" and 225 and have no concerns with this table holding me, in fact I am sure it would easily hold twice my weight. Being so tall I was also a bit concerned that the table would be able to be raised high enough for me to give a massage but having used it now I can say that is not a problem. On the receiving end of the massage it is a bit narrow as when I would like to place my arm by my side I find they want to slip off so I typically place my arms in the arm sling I purchased and it feels great!Being a hobby woodworker I thought about building one of these but I can say that I am glad I didn't as this has been a very good value."

I must have this soon!!!Please!!!!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,The first week or so this stuff was great but as I kept using it (and the same amount too) it started to lose it's effect by the end of the day and started to ooze. It's very easy to get off your gums compared to other creams I've used but I can't stomach the oozing. It makes me feel sick. I would use this over other products but wish they could come up with something better after all these years. Tip

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I have a bottle of the SUPER costly stuff - with healing essential oils - and couldn't see paying the SAME amount for one tiny bottle of said goo - when I could have this GIGANTIC ENORMOUS tub of goo for the same price, including the shipping! And since I need a LOT of the stuff because I hurt so friggin much - this stuff is great. And it looks pretty sitting on the shelf, glowing radiant blue, too!One trick - pour it into the little bottle OVER your sink. It's kind of hard to do - and the cube is a bit unwieldy - practice for a few minutes holding it and thinking the process through. LOL!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"Began this product by substituting for Activia, which I'd tried for three months but got tired of having to have perishable yogurt on hand 24/7, so I thought I'd give pills a try. No difference between the effects of the Activia and the pills .. both are good. Not a miracle, but better than it used to be, and that's a good thing."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I wish I had this when I was in the hospital for multiple days after my cesarian. I was awkward and shy, lacked coordination, and not confident in nursing -while having lots of visitors. This lifesaver has enabled me to nurse publicly without flashing anyone - maintaining decorum and privacy. It is a wonderful invention and it has made me feel much more liberated about being able to nurse anywhere with anyone around. I used this in very hot weather also, the material is nice and light, not too hot and very portable. I plan to buy this for all new future moms I know!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"EXCELLENT! One of the most efficacious, inexpensive and easily storable (most good quality ones have to be refrigerated) probiotics!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,"I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of ""Pack of six 40-count boxes"" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a ""normal"" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The ""savings"" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.Sonya Hamilton"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I bought this based on reviews, but would not recommend it. I tried to use it but it kept slipping from side to side and the baby didn't like having it lay on his face. I've heard that the Hooter Hider is a better option since it has a wire in the top so you can see the baby."
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"I guess I'm the .03% that this product didn't work for. My plantar fasciitis must be more severe than most. I've pushed the limits playing basketball 3-4 days per week, now its hard to walk more than a block. The HTP Heel Seat is somewhat comfortable however there is almost no cushion where the center of your heel sits on the insert. If they would have put a little cushion there the comfort and healing may be more successful. They are versatile, and fit snugly in most shoes without removing the existing insert. Around the house I wore them with crocs, which I have found provide the most cushion. I wore the product for two weeks straight and found no appreciable pain relief. I recommend stretching and icing 3-4 time per day, with zero impact exercise over this product."
health personal care,health care,foot care,3.0,it has changed a bit from what I have used in the past... Haven't really done it faithfully though...I just don't have time to soak areas that need this to be applied to for 5 minutes before every use
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,felt it trimming me down. a little stomach upset but that's a small price to pay and very worth it.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"The best tasting rum cake I have eaten in a long time. Good color,smell,and moist. Will buy one again."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,Simply plain and delicious so you don't taste the added flavoring but the chip itself and the topping of your choosing. (Love it with hummus!)
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,What a great product. Doesn't break down with use and you don't need to reapply that often.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,This organic brown rice farina beats cream of wheat hands down. I have it for breakfast nearly every morning.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have always liked Kirkland products because of its constancy with quality. This product is no different. You get a good quality product for a little less than other similar products. It's a good buy, plus it's good for your health."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I must reiterate what another reviewer said. Tasty Bite Madras lentils do taste an awful lot like beef chili, a perfect alternative for those who love chili but want a vegetarian alternative. They also have a similar mouth feel and a nice hearty spiciness. What they do not have is a lot of excess calories. One can eat the whole pouch (2 servings worth) and only ingest a mere 240 calories. That can't be beat!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,3.0,"Not quite as ""mushroomy"" as I was hoping for, but the subtle flavor is definitely there."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,3.0,"I have been trying to stay with all natural supplements for my anxiety since I stopped taking Celexa. Celexa worked great for me but the side effects proved to be too much. Seredyn seemed to make me sleepy and not take away the anxiety. I was still restless and my mind was still racing but I was tired. I have since switched to Amoryn, but have only been on it for a week it recomends giving it at least three to four weeks to kick in."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,1.0,I also wanted to like this item. I love Ramen noodles - but this had a weird after taste. Did not like it.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,"This is the MOST wonderful damson preserve I have tasted since my grandmother made it at home (east coast USA) in the early 1970's. Treat yourself to this gorgeous, deep ruby preserve and let the delight soak through you! Put it on toast or a warm biscuit with butter, and be transported to taste bud heaven and good, simple times past all at once. Thank you, Wilkin & Sons, for making a memory turn into a lovely reality for me."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"Wonderful product. My child is allergic to gluten and Tinkyada's rice pasta is the best option for us. It is affordable, and it tastes great! Our family loves all of Tinkyada's rice pasta products!"
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,3.0,This is an adorable product but it does has some down falls. The plastic piece that clasps over the nipple if the product is removed or drop digs into baby's face and leaves red marks also plastic is rather thin and breaks easily. Overall its a cute idea just needs a few adjustments.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"The first time I got to hold this golden lovely thing, I felt a shift in my energy immediately and I could not put it down,so I had to buy it! It felt like my back tension, stress and pains were just melting away. It has also nicely energizing effect.I have been healing my back and neck pains for 8 months.. this device showed up to be a hugehelp in my overall healing on many levels...I am very thankful for this Angel in my life~!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,This is the best topical I've ever used. The best part is it has no lasting odor and doesn't stain or make your clothes smell. No miracles here but does provide relief.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"The foot wrap was too small for my feet, the wraps are womans size 7 .I didnt realize this untill I received them, it said nothing about size in the product information. They seem like they would be good if you have small feet, I wear a size mens 10 and they didnt come close to fitting me."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"He loves the flavor and I love that it helps with his eczema. More expensive them other fish oil vitamins, but it's worth it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Have done many price and quantity searches in stores and online. This combo of flax seed and (evening) primrose oil, in this quantity and strength beats every other source and price I've been able to find. I do check around every year or so to make sure this still stands true, and so far so good."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I love these. I like not having to open the single packs. And my daughter who needs a chewable likes these 'tastless' pills over the vanilla ones.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I've tried several others to help relieve pain in my shoulders, and Whal 2 speed massager is the best one I've found."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"according to my nutritionist, coconut water is much healthier for you than gatorade. I'd say Zico Mango is the best coconut water flavor choice available!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me. There is no religious reason for me NOT to eat bacon; however, these give you that smokey flavor of bacon without the fakey smoked tasted of turkey bacon or just that liquid smoke stuff. I love bacon, I love bonito flakes and have become addicted to dashi, the basic Japanese broth they use in almost everything.It's much more natural, it's delicious, it's not like anything else. I have yet to come across 'artificial bonito flakes' - that should tell you something."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I was doing a little research and stumbled on these vitamins. I was a little skeptical when it says gentle on stomach, I have tried different ones that stated the same thing and was false. Once I took that first pill I felt great and no stomach problems. These vitamins are very pure and potent and in my opinion you will not find a better multivit for the money. I really think I found my everyday multivit. I like the fact that it has whole foods in it also, and is iron free. I reccomend to all that you should try this wonderful product!!!!!!!!!"
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"I cannot agree more that this natural product is liquid gold for skin. There is nothing like it in the market. It even softens nails and makes skin feel and look younger. No more hardened skin, no more cracks. Enough said."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,5.0,Vances Dari-free is excellent for making drink smoothies and baking. The dry powder mix makes an excellent coffee creamer that you can take with you in a powdered form for having a cup of coffee at a restaurant or coffee cafe.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"This table is sturdy,fairly comfortable and a great value for the money. It's a bit heavy to transport, but the upside is that it has a solid feel. The table warmer seems to work well and provides a very cozy base to lie on."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I hope these come in stock, and soon! I'm a Seventh-day Adventist (a lot of us are vegetarians and know good veggie stuff) and would normally get Super-Links from the Potomac Adventist Book and Health Food Store in Silver Spring, Maryland. However, they're not that close so the nearest option is Safeway but they're almost $9.00 for a single can...rather outrageous.I didn't grow up vegetarian but if I had a supply of these I would never miss the real thing. They're good right out of the can (heated quickly) and into a hot dog bun. Most of all, I love chopping a few into small rounds and cooking with sauteed onions, stewed tomatoes, sweet corn, and little bit of sugar (to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes). Delicious over rice! Enjoy!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,Bought this to have for when my grandchildren come over. It is sturdy and comfortable for the child. Easy to clean and seems to be well made. My daughter liked it so much she bought two and uses them exclusively for her twins instead of a traditional high chair.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I just received this pump after trying to pump manually and this little pump is SO great! I tried so many times to manually pump and it is extremely tiring and I was only getting 2 ounces total from both sides! This pump works wonderfully and is very quiet, comfortable, and affordable! I got 4 ounces out of one side the very first time I used it! I also really like that it allows you to discreetly pump because it's so small and very easy to hide (large hamburger size). I would highly recommend this to someone who pumps every so often like myself. It's great to take on trips too as it works very well on batteries!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I bought these for a cheap price on Amazon, but when I ran out I purchased the ""generic brand"" at Wal-Mart for a few dollars cheaper than the Playtex brand, they work just as well, and do the same thing."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"I have purchased 2 of these, the second was purchased after I thought the first was just a bad apple in a bunch. Neither one has ever given me an accurate read, or a consistent read. Some reviews point to a consumers report, but I have never had one that worked. Because of this I have never purchased a BD product again."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"It's OK for the price, but I don't think it's all that effective. A little noisy, but it didn't do much for my feet."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,3.0,I am always looking for healthly snack alternatives. This one was okay.The flavor was decent and the sugar content wasn't too high. My daughter did not love them but wouldn't turn them down. I think it was because she prefers a berry taste and these have a more subdued taste.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I don't specifically disagree with the first reviewer -- but he makes some claims that I, personally, cannot find information on the box to support. Yes, they group the ""whole grains and seeds"" as first ingredient (actually, the first set of ingredients). Within this ""ingredient"", they include whole wheat flour, black and white sesame seeds, millet, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, triticale meal, rye meal, malted wheat flakes, oats, brown rice meal, and barley flakes). Then the next ""ingredient"" is enriched flour.The problem is that there is no way to determine whether the first ""ingredient"" is 80% of the total recipe or 40% -- and no way of knowing, within that amount, how much is in each sub-ingredient. I suspect that they did this unusual grouping of ingredients to hide their recipe -- but, as noted by the other reviewer's reaction, it may very well be counter-productive. If they had split out the set of ingredients into their separate parts, one would have a much better idea as to how it is made.I have been counseled that I am pre-diabetic. For me, therefore, it is very important to keep up the dietary fiber in the carbohydrates that I eat (slows digestion, keeps insulin levels steadier). Looking through my local supermarket, the GrainsFirst crackers was the only cracker & cheese type of cracker that met the criteria of 2g dietary fiber or more per serving (they actually list exactly 2g). It's tasty and it fits my dietary needs (sure, I'd rather have 3 or 4g -- work with what one can get).There are other crackers that meet the dietary criteria -- like Triscuits and a few others -- but they aren't really the same category of cracker in my opinion.Worth some extra money -- but you may be able to beat the price from Amazon if you can find them locally."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Packets of dried vitamin powder that you add to water, juice, whatever.Product as described. Online price reasonably competitive with my local market price."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"My sons often raid my cabinets for my sushi nori. (Nori is the Japanese name for this product, called ""Kim"" in Korean) They just eat sheets of it, not even bothering to toast it sometimes. This is the kind of seaweed that they wrap sushi in. I usually hide my packages of Nori sheets, so that I have enough to use when I want to make my vegetable sushi rolls with brown rice.When I saw this product, I decided to give it a try, and I must agree--it is DELICIOUS! You get 24 little packs of tiny nori (kim) sheets, roasted in sesame oil and lightly salted. There's hardly any calories in this--25 per pack--but the main nutritional value is vitamin A (39%) and vitamin C (20%). I think that the flavor is wonderful, but it may be strange if you aren't used to seaweed or sushi. In that case I suggest that you just buy a small package of it somewhere first, and see how you like it. Anyway, the little packs are attractive, and handy to grab for snacking. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a lot of packaging involved in order to protect the fragile tiny sheets, but probably no worse than packs of cookies or chips, I think.I like this stuff, and I'm going to gift most of it to my now grown sons, because I know they'll love it. I haven't tried any other snack packs of nori (KIM), so I can't compare. But I can suggest, that if you like to eat this stuff, but don't want all the packaging, you can buy nori sheets by the bulk pack. We like to toast them lightly over an open flame, which is kind of fun, but don't let your little kids do this alone! The flavor is good, though drier and less salty than the ""Sea Gift"" snacks. Either way, Nori/Kim is a terrific seaweed!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I make this for my husband every morning. I keep telling him I will teach him how to use our espresso machine, but of course it tastes better if I make it. It is delicious or he won't care whether I make it while he reads the newspaper. this is ese compatible"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,This product was ordered as a precaution and arrived quickly and safely. I hope I never have to use it if someone in our house gets the flu.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This may be better than any of the regular cornbread mixes or recipes you find that contain wheat. I absolutely love this mix. I like to add a can of corn for texture and a little cheese or ground chipotle for pizazz. You will not be disappointed with this product.
health personal care,health care,unknown,4.0,"My ears/sinuses are extremely sensitive to pressure changes. I use these EarPlanes when we fly. They definitely work. The biggest problem for me is that they are so painful to leave in my ears. The hard rubber ridges are not comfortable. After about 30 minutes I just want to rip these out of my ears. But, they are the only product that definitely works, so I put up with it.I also use the ""Flents Flitemate"" brand of ear air pressure plugs. The Flents are much, much more comfortable. But, for me, they do not work as well for significant pressure changes. So, I may use my Flents during takeoff, but I ALWAYS use my EarPlanes for descent. Or, if I have more sinus congestion than normal, I would use EarPlanes.By the way, if you are new to using EarPlanes for ear air pressure regulation -- you do not necessarily need to leave the plugs in during the entire flight. Just put them in at take off and keep them in until you reach cruising altitude. Then you can take them out. But, if you notice turbulence or the pilot saying they need to go down for a bit, put the plugs back in until the cruising stabilizes again. And, of course, put them back in as soon as the plane starts its descent. Of course, everyone had different sinuses, so you may need to leave them in the entire flight. But, for me, they are so painful to leave in I have to compromise.Oh, also -- I use the EarPlanes over and over forever (until I lose them). I have never noticed a problem from re-using them.Overall, I highly recommend this product. A must if you have sinus/ear issues. Buy these and a pair of the more comfortable Flents Flitemates and you are set."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"I have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself, it was part of a gift for my daughter in Grad School. She likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until Christmas ( that remains to be seen) without having to buy more. A very good snack for a poor Grad Student"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,This chip has a crunch like no other and it has just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. The only problem is I can't keep the back down!!!!
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,Not so sure about these! They say theyre easy to read and all but half the time the control line barely even showed up! If your serious about trying I recommend something else!
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"the best most comfy on the market. i buy these by the gross. discovered these on round the world trips. block out big city and dormitory noise. now keep them on the night stand for late partys and early risers. get gross after a month but a single box lasts a year. and not kidding but 12 boxes at a time. 36 bucks but last me a 10 years. after they warm up just keep pushing them in till you can't hear anything. i've tried every kind made, these are the only ones that work for me."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"For two years, my wife has had about a 10 cm chronic skin lesion on her lower leg. Probably a result of banging in to the dishwasher cover when it was open and she was not paying attention. She had been to the dermatologist many times, with several different steroid Rx, some more potent than others. The redness and itching would come and go, with flaking, disomfort and recalcitrance (that's a doctor word that means it won't go away). Starting this Derma product abut two months ago, the lesion appears to be gone. We must wait and see if it returns, but so far, this product is dynamite."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Received Sea to Shinning Sea and am very disappointed. The first disc the sounds vary greatly. First it loud, then very soft so that you are constantly changing the volume. The quality of the sound is poor. I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to take the time, therefore that is my fault. I would be very very hesitant of buy anything else from Reader's Digest Music.Cynthia Towslee"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"We bought this cover to protect our mattress from kitty ""accidents."" Seems to be working well. It's a good quality for the price, and easily fit my full size bed. No crunching noices when you sit, or lay down. I suppose it could rip if you were to shift it alot while you are sleeping. For $16 though, a definite baragin."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"Mark Rampolla introduced Zico in 2004 after discovering coconut water as a Peace Corp volunteer in Central America; it has been catching on ever since. Why because it is great tasting; but most importantly it is great for you. It contains more potassium than one banana and only contains 60 calories.Potassium is key and it has 15 times more than sports drinks; as those of us who have problems with muscle cramping are relieved to know. I think it is probably the best natural drink that I have found to promote hydration.I love the natural, the passion fruit and the mango flavors. All of them taste natural because they are..they are not sweet and the fruit flavors are really only the essence of the flavor itself and are quite subtle tasting.I can't think of a better or more healthy drink...in fact because of its potassium content, I consider it a better drink than plain water. It also contains a healthy complement of phosphorous, magnesium and calcium with even a gram of protein.Enjoy this drink experience after exercising and you will never feel faint and/or dehydrated again.Bentley/2009"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,3.0,Really great tasting chips. I really did not expect them to be as hard as they were. Good if they are cover with a cheese sauce.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I was trying to decide between a high chair and a more portable ""booster"" seat option. I didn't want a regular plastic high chair and knew I would have to spend quite a bit more to get a decent wooden one. I also wanted something that wouldn't take up too much space in our dining room. A friend who had purchased a high chair and booster recommended the FP Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat. I absolutely love it - great function, esp for the price! This particular style has three height adjustments which I really like. I know there's another FP version that does not have the height adjustments so you'll want to make sure you are ordering the right one if height adjustment is important to you. I also like the three adjustments on the tray. It comes with two trays and a cover. We use the white tray for feeding. If we want the baby to sit with us for dinner and she's already done feeding, we use the main tray and put toys on it for her. I find the attachment system to be very secure. The webbing can be a bit difficult to adjust, but I think that's better than having it move too easily and slip when the baby moves around. I did see reviews of chairs tipping over with the booster attached. My little one recently put her foot against the table and pushed back. If she were older and stronger, I could see where this would be a problem, but I don't think this is so much a problem with the booster chair as the main chair to which it is attached. I would definitely recommend buying this item and believe it could serve as your primary (and only) feeding chair."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"Avoid this thing like the plague. As many others have said, the readings are all over the place, and can't be trusted. Thre readings will go from 97.1 to 100.2 in a flash. The margin of error is completely unacceptable. Your child could have a fever of 100.2, and you won't even know it because this thermometer is a joke."

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"This stuff is great, it really works. It restores that peaceful, hopeful well being feeling. A soothing ""everything will be ok"" feeling."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"The Frio Pump Wallet is the perfect product for keeping my pump cool. I have been diabetic for 37 years and have been using an insulin pump for 30 years. The heat during summer months has been an ongoing problem for me for more than 27 years. The heat became a critical problem about three years ago. I worked in a warehouse in Texas for 9 years and most of the time was seated close to a overhead air conditioning vent. However, about three years ago I was relocated to an area where the air conditioning had little effect and the summer months were miserable. My blood sugars would sky rocket and I was having difficulty keeping it down. I searched and searched for a resolution to my problem. My doctor changed my insulin to one that was not as heat sensative, but this did not solve the problem. Then one night I came across an article telling about the Frio Pump Wallet and how it had been tested in the field, used during climbs up mountains, camping, jogging, and many other outdoor activities. So, I went to the internet and searched for Frio and located their website. Thank God for that article! I have used my Frio Pump Wallet for the last three years. So, much so that I am now in need of a replacement sleeve, because I have worn mine out. Also, since we have relocated to Florida I feel that I may use it more often. All I can say is that using the Frio Pump Wallet has proven to be the remedy to my problem."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"It may all be in my head. I don't really fathom how a couple tiny magnets around my wrist would do anything for pain. I suffer from a mild case of Sciatica on a daily basis. That was until I put on the bracelet. I've been wearing this over a month, and have had no back pain since. Amazing! When this one wears out, I will be buying another.Update"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I say ""seemed to work"" because I did not use these in isolation. I used them as part of the diet outlined on the ""Cholesterol Down"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I love everything about this booster. I like that it has different height settings, so I can be closer to eye level with my son while feeding him. The main reason I got it is because it's portable and can fit on any chair. I love the fact that the seat has no cracks so that food can not get stuck in. The only down side is that it didn't take my 7 month old very long to figure out that the tray is removable."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I took FB for one month with no results. I bought a 2nd bottle, thinking that I just hadn't been taking it long enough, but when I opened the 2nd bottle, the pills were a completely different color than the first bottle and smelled much stronger. This suggests to me that the amount of vitex in Fertility Blend is not the same in each bottle, which is a serious problem. The pills don't even tell you how many mg of Vitex you are getting in each pill.I started taking Vitex and returned the 2nd bottle of FB. The first month I took Vitex, I had a 28 day period for the first time in my life. I have pcos and this really helped me! I did not get pregnant my first month of vitex, but this is the 2nd month and I took ovulation tests this month and my ovulation test was positive today. I highly recommed Vitex instead! And it's only about $10/bottle."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"These bars are really tasty and representative of the brand. It would be nice if they were a little larger. I use them as a breakfast for my 3 kids, and they all like this flavor. I love the fact that they are organic. Most of the conventional breakfast bars are mostly shell and a little filling. These are exactly the opposite. I will continue to purchase these as a breakfast option."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Since moving to CentraL NY state, I've had a difficult time finding Jamaican Jerk blends that my husband likes. For years (in Illinois and New Jersey), we'd used Spice Hunter. After checking multiple local groceries stores, I could find none. I finally decided to check the web -duh! Found the spices/Spice Hunter, ordered 2, and in just a few short days they arrived. Out has gone the ""try this one"" efforts and Spice Hunter is back in it's rightful place on our shelf."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I've suffered with mouth ulcers or canker sores my whole life. Generally when tired, run down, stressed or from biting or cutting my tongue, mouth or lips! Despite 30 years experience, they are still as painful, although now I do tolerate them a lot more. I've recently had a bout of canker sores from doing double shifts at work and not getting enough R&R;! So I've been quite aggressive in trying to find a product. I recently found CANKER SORE COVERS which work very well and I highly recommend, but they get a bit messy. This product however I stumbled upon at the pharmacy and it works very quickly and very cleanly. The ingredient is cerbamide peroxide, it has a little sting upon application but it really takes the pain and the infection away very quickly.I used it on a developing sore from biting the back of my tongue. I could feel it was going to develop in to a nasty sore and in a very painful area. It felt like it was past the point of no return and would definitely be forming. I applied this liquid directly to the site and then intermittently rinsed with several drops and it completely stopped the development. I applied it for two days and by the end of the second day there was no evidence or feeling of a sore!Great! Buy this!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"This Rusk is exactly how I remembered it tasting a little more than 50 years ago in my first home economics class. Our teacher used it in our very first cooking endeavor. I recall we spread them with tuna salad, a slice of tomato, topped with a slice of American cheese, then placed them in the oven.My purchase arrived fresh, crisp, and very enjoyable. I was concerned about freshness, but I need not have worried. They were well packed and, so far, no broken pieces. I've enjoyed sharing them with family and friends."

My brother was having the same symtoms of neck and back problems that I had before my surgery. I wanted to help, but I could not give up my product. So, I started to look around on the web for what I used. I came across the cervical collar by Elasto-Gel and the same product I was using. I sent both to him. The cervical collar by Elasto-Gel came before the other product. He was in sooo much pain he could not move. He said that this product was a lifesaver. He said that he doesn't know what he did with out it. He travels a lot so he can bring it along. He said that with out this product, he would be in the hospital right now. That is the same way I felt with my product. He uses it alllll the time and takes it with him where ever he goes.I talked to my neurosurgeon, who I see on a monthly basis. I told him he should suggest to his patients to get these because I really think they are a godsend for people with neck problems."

I take about 1 TBLSP/day internally; put in my coffee, spread it on my toast. No only is my enery level up, the pain from my shoulder bursitis is gone. Since I have been taking EVCO, I haven't have to take my medication for my bursitis and joint pain.This is also great to clean my face with at night followed by warm damp cloth.

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"I really enjoy these chips. The Mediterranean flavor is superb without overpowering the flavor of the various root vegetables. I originally tried these in an attempt to wean myself off of potato chips. The blend of sweet potato, Taro, and other root vegetables makes for a very nice combination. The flavoring is subtle and nicely compliments the chips. I have also used these for scooping guacamole (the Taro ones are best for this), and they work very nicely. I have been happy with many of Terra's products, but I especially like these Mediterranean flavored ""exotic"" chips."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"There seem to be many negative reviews for these bags, but I have no serious complaints about them. I have stored milk nearly 50 times using the Medela bags and have been completely satisfied. They are sturdy and hold up well when being reheated. However, I do dislike the fact that the way they are closed is to insert a little trash bag tie into the two pre-cut holes and then fold over and over and twist together until tight. I store my milk in tupperware and then enclose in large freezer ziplocks and have not had any problem with the milk being corrupted. The way they close is annoying because it doesn't freeze flat at all and I can only store 3 bags of milk per container- thus taking up tons of space in the freezer. When I heat these up in a pot or under hot water I never have to double bag or worry about leaks and that is what matters most to me. I recommend these bags and will continue to use for the remainder of my time breast feeding."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Blends very easily. Has a mild taste.

Gives a great nutritional boost - and all those B vitamins are great for the ""nerves' before a work day begins and I like the protein in it too. Have been taking yeast for 20 years - it did take a few weeks to get used to the taste when I began, since I only stirred it in milk. With the fruit and a little sweetener - it tastes really good."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,1.0,"First, the inside case was damaged because the plastic wrap securing the cans in the case had been torn apart. Due to that, every can was dented so badly, I was unable to place the can on any flat surface without it falling over, or the top of the can was dented outwards that the pull tab broke off while attemping to open it. I wound up using a hammer to flatten out the dent on the bottom and/or using pliers to remove the entire pull tab. They also could not be stored standing up in the refrig.After drinking the first can I immediately did not care very much for its taste. It had a flavor that is difficult to describe...not fruity, but more like a funny bubble gum taste, and it did not provide any energy, at least not to me.I purchased this product a few months ago and I still have about fifteen (15) ""dented"" cans remaining.I highly recommend that anyone makes an attempt to purchase and try one (1) can before purchasing an entire case of twenty-four (24)."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This stuff tastes like chocolaty cookie dough. I really like it. 24 of these is a lot of little packets, so they're good value. And, they're little. I'd never get even close to full on one of these, but they're a great snack when I just want something small. Probably the equivalent of a spoonful of cookie dough.Most chocolate flavored nutritional stuff doesn't even taste like chocolate, so I was surprised this actually tastes like chocolate.The ""Litter Leash"" feature is really cool, because this prevents you from getting rid of the top. It keeps the tiny part you usually discard, attached to the rest of it. I didn't realize that's what the ""Litter Leash"" did until I looked carefully at the packet, so the first one of these I ate, I practically destroyed the whole thing. I thought it was super cool after, though."

grocery gourmet food,baby food,cereal,4.0,"Earth's Best Baby FoodMy favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.Fruit & Whole Grain Combo, Peach - Oatmeal - BananaThis variety was a huge hit with my son and was given to him most every day until about a year and a half. My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go. That's why I'm giving it four stars as opposed to five. Although, I would say this flavor is definitely worth a try for any child who has moved passed the basic stage one foods."

He said it can be stimulating to some people with insomnia. That's exactly what happened to me. I tried it at various times of day and ended up taking it 15 minutes before breakfast.

health personal care,health care,allergy,2.0,"This is a very nice Neti Pot that I wish I owned. But since it arrived broken, I couldn't even try it. Look, Netis are great, there's no doubt about it. Take a look at the reviews for this item, and almost every other Neti Pot on the market, and you will note that almost all of them don't rate the item, they rate the benefits of sinus cleansing. Let's just say that's a given, OK? So this review isn't about the process, it's about the actual piece of merchandise. DON'T ORDER this ceramic pot through the mail. Find it locally or find an unbreakable plastic item to order through the mail. Chances are that any ceramic pot like this one 'may' break in the mail, like it did to me, and then you will have to go through the return process - which by the way, is as painless as I have seen all credit to Amazon.com (part of why I am a very frequent shopper here). So the bottom line is this item is no good through the mail - sinus cleansing with Neti Pots is awesome. Hope this helps."

The other great feature is that it is super easy to clean--no little nooks and crannies to mess with, just wipe and go! There is no need for an expensive fancy high chair unless you just like throwing your money around!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"One of the best CLIF bar flavors to date. They are more on the sweet side, which to me most all CLIF bars are tasty and sweet. It definitely captures a gingerbread cookie with delicious icing. I ordered mine early October '09 and they arrived fresh, cheaper than Wally World (less than a dollar per bar), and in the convenient shelf display box.I wish I could get these all year round :("
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit, so I needed a strong replacement. Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me. There's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it's a tea, you don't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it. For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.The flavor is very herby and grassy. It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink. It's not something that I would order at a restaurant, but the flavor is passable for me so I don't mind drinking it.The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached. I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process. I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.Overall, I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink. It definitely wakes me up and I don't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath, the jitters or an upset stomach."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,"I've tried many omega products for my son; this is the best so far. Since it's a powder, you can easily mix with any food that your kid loves to eat. I mix with yogurt, applesauce and milk. It's easily mixed and dissolved. I've been using it since my son was 6 months. The best thing is that it's not smelly at all like other omega products, so my son doesn't even notice it in his yogurt. I highly recommend this product."

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I'm not one for taking meds/pills at the slightest sign of a cold. In fact, I usually try to tough it out. However, last year, I had a bad cold that just would not quit. The worst part was my cough and the congestion I felt both in my throat and in my sinuses and nose. Just about all other symptoms went away except for this. So, I decided I'd give this a try. The results were outstanding.I know that other reviewers state that combining both an expectorant and cough suppressant doesn't make sense, but I beg to differ. These symptoms often appear at the same time and Mucinex DM quickly thins out the mucous regardless of whether its in your throat or in your nose. It makes it easier to cough up the nasty stuff, you just won't have the urge to cough over and over and over again. It works very fast and the whole time-release thing is a definite plus. I've only ever taken one pill at a time (see the beginning of my review), but I assume if things were really bad you could follow the directions on the label and try taking two every twelve hours. In any case, this stuff works for me. I highly recommend it! Just make sure you stay hydrated. It makes everything work better (the meds and your body)."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,Works great and is worth the money. If you don't have a problem taking all the pills you will be happy. I only used two in the morning and two in the evening. Did not feel I needed to take more. Worked great and I am happy. Just tried a different brand and did not even come close.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"I'm a first time mom and have never used any other breast pumps. When shopping for a breast pump before returning to work, I read lots of reviews and considered other products as well. This pump was much cheaper than other comparable ones and I was concerned that ""you get what you paid for"". But after having used it for 4+ months 2-3 times each day, I can say that it works perfectly fine and gets the job done. I haven't had any noise issues as other reviewers. Can't say it's whisper-quiet, but it is silent enough that I can pump at work without disturbing anyone.The reasons for not giving it 5 stars.1) As others have already mentioned, suction and speed could've been stronger - I use the highest speed all the time and still feel like the baby is doing a better job. Also I think that I don't get as much milk with the pump as the baby does (the breasts still feel a bit full). However, it could be just my problem with reflexes and it is not a major issue.2) Both white silicone tips got damaged exactly after 3 months of use (parts are only covered for 3 months). Fortunately, there are some spare ones included with the pump, but I'll need it for at least 4-5 more months, so most likely it will need another set. The problem is that when they get damaged the pump looses suction slightly and it actually took me a couple of days to figure out the source of the problem. Also these tiny bits are very easy to lose (once they almost fell into the garbage disposal).Otherwise I don't really have any complaints. It took some getting used to, but overall I'm happy I haven't spent almost twice as much on Medela."

Unfortunately, mine can ""spit"" water a good 1' on occasion. I dealt with this by placing the unit in a foil turkey cooking pan. It does use a lot of power because it's continuously boiling water.

You cannot find a better value for enteric coated (no yucky fish burps) 1000MG, purified (no mercury) fish oil.

After a few days it was bleeding and excruciatingly painful -- I said enough was enough and went to the store to look for something for it, and I found this. While I was expecting to seal up the crack to protect it and maybe make it a little less painful, what I wasn't expecting was how rapidly it has made the crack heal... I am honestly amazed... it has been only 3 days and what was a deep, 1/2-inch long crack is now little more than a small nick.Will definitely use again, and definitely recommend, it will blow you away."

After multiple trial and errors I decided the Green Vibrance (approx 1 dollar a serving) is the best quality for the money, if you are on a budget the Now Foods Phytofoods has a 2 pound bottle that knocks the price per serving around .50 cents.Still shaking my head why Daily Greens wants almost $30 for 10 ounces for an inferior product."

By 1930 they were the leading cause of death in America.I prefer the fats that people ate for thousands of years before the epidemic. Nutiva smells good and can be spooned in winter. It's cheaper than some brands. Large jars are practical because it stays fresh on the shelf for many months after opening."

I was disappointed in the size of the bags, just 1/2 oz but I suppose I should have been aware of that. I would hope the company would soon make available larger bags of these cheese products. I want to try the other flavors but not sure I want to buy all those tiny bags. Thanks for the product, consider giving us larger amounts of the product. Thanks --- MM"

Other soaps and some body washes leave my skin dry and rough. This product works very nicely on my sensitive skin. It also doubles as a really nice bubble bath, leaving you feeling nice and smooth afterwards.... enjoy"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I have bought twin labs before and they have been very effective, however the amino acid pills didnt really do anything for me personally. I take the twin labs strength creatine pills and those work amazing.I am 21 yrs old male 185lbs. i work out 4-5 times a week. Working out to gain mass.Heres a few things have to say:The pills are gigantic. I dont mind taking larger pills but i havent seen any pills this big. Although they are easy to swallow just beware they are a bit big.The label says to take three after each meal. I took three twice a day and i dont think the extra three would have changed my opinion about these. 9 a day seems a bit much to me.When i take the twinlabs creatine strength pills i really feel a pump when i go to the gym, but with these i didnt feel anything. From what ive read they are supposed to help in recovery and build muscle but i didnt really see any difference.I took these religiously for a month and i didnt see any weight gain attributed to taking them. Ive gained about 15 pounds in the past two months but i think it is more directly related to eating more, working out hard and drinking protein shakes. I havent taken them in a few weeks and i am still seeing gains.I think when it comes to pills, we are all affected differently. Whereas the strength ones work for me these might work for someone else. I didnt see any additional benefits but that shouldnt deter you from trying them yourself.Everyone reacts differently so try many different things until you find what your looking for. I have tried about 10 different brands of protein shakes until i finally found one that i liked and one that made me gain weight. I recommend muscle tech products more specifically the nitro tech is a great protein shake. Thanks for reading."

health personal care,health care,unknown,3.0,"I've dealt with sciatica every day for about 6 months. I first bought an inversion table which helps tremendously. Come to find out, my sciatica was mainly caused from the mattress my wife and I bought, it's too soft. After I figured that out, I tried sleeping on a twin mattress that was much firmer for about a week and my back pain went away and it moved into my right buttock area and was causing severe pains down my right leg. It made it very difficult to sit in an office chair or even drive down the road in a car. I studied up on the Sacro-Wedgy and decided to purchase one. While I was waiting for it to arrive, I decided to try a bath towel using the Sacro-Wedgy instructions. I rolled a bath towel up and placed on end of it under me (start at about your waist line). I would just lay down on it while balancing myself on it and relax my lower body. Within 5 minutes the pain diminished and a few days later after the item arrived, the pain was gone. I used the bath towel about 2 times (20 min. each time) a day and the pain was gone. Of course I tested the Sacro-Wedgy out when it arrived. I believe it will do the same thing in relieving pain from the Piriformis muscle being aggravated, in my opinion the bath towel works better and costs about 1/5 of what this product costs.If you're like me and have this type of pain, you should try the bath towel technic before purchasing this."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"A neighbor of mine, a nurse, recommended that I try Stevia two or three years ago. I researched it and saw a few different types of Stevia, and one company, NuNaturals, talked about how they took the bitter licorice taste out of their Stevia. I also spoke with several people who said that yes, Stevia has an aftertaste you have to get used to. I can't stand licorice. I looked around locally for NuStevia and only found it at a GNC store at $10 for 100 packets. A little expensive, but after the very first time I used it in my morning coffee, I was sold. NuStevia tastes very smooth, almost exactly like sugar. It's not super-sweet like Sweet Thing, NutraSweet, Equal, or Sweet'N Low, and it tastes much better than Splenda does.I turned my parents on to NuStevia and when I was visiting them in July, I saw that Dad had a box of 1000 packets! He said he had bought the box from Amazon.com, so I came here and bought a 1000-packet box for my wife and me. Outstanding product at an outstanding price!"

I think it's a ripoff because the box says ""with heat"" but there is no heat, and gives you the impression that the center attachments actually work. It's a let down and when you're looking forward to a nice foot massage with heat and bubbles, you end up with cold wet feet!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"The SEA GIFT KOREAN ROASTED & SEA SALTED SEAWEED SNACKS are a wonderful treat if you like snacks with good flavor.I like well-seasoned foods and even though these have a nice salted flavor, I would have preferred a saltier taste. But these seaweed sheets have just the right amount of flavor for most people.If you don't know what seaweed snacks are they are sheets of dehydrated seaweed that's been roasted and seasoned with salt or soy sauce, and can be eaten either with rice or alone. They're thin like paper and slightly different from the type of seaweed that's used for wrapping sushi, which is not seasoned.Each seaweed rectangular sheet measures about 3.25"" x 2.25"" and comes in 11 sheets per package. There are 24 packs in each order so that's plenty for making rice balls or adding to other dishes or just eating alone.I agree with another reviewer who stated that there was a lot of packaging for such a small amount in each pack, but I've tried other dried ""nori"" seaweed snacks and once you open the container, you have a set amount of time to eat all the seaweed or it will get hard and stick together. Perhaps that's why these are packaged individually in sheets of 11.Anyway, I really like these seaweed snacks and will be ordering more!"

We all like it without cream or sugar, the flavors are so rich and vibrant that it easily stands on its own.Harney & Sons even somehow got my boyfriend off of soda, he bought a bunch of different flavors and has them with his meals instead now.

It's not exactly like homemade, but for a quick meal when you're in a hurry, it's okay. The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink. These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal. Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty! I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get.

They used to sell the RAW kind and for some reason, it is not available. The title is therefore misleading."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"Long Grain and Wild Rice Pilaf is definitely one of Near East's best carbohydrate dishes, to spice up an evening meal. At Amazon's price for a 12-package carton, moreover, this superb mix (with super saver shipping) would cost at least 30 cents less per box than at our local grocery store. And we do love it.But that's still more than 43 cents per ounce, and a local supermarket now carries a fantastic basmati, wild rice and vegetable medley in 16-ounce packages. The latter costs more than 70% less. Admittedly, Near East's Long Grain & Wild Rice Pilaf tastes better than the basmati and wild rice mix, which does not include any spices.But we can add our own spices. It's hard to argue with the savings. Except for rare occasions, we have switched off Near East to the far less costly brand."

I cannot tell any difference in appearance or taste between Lewis Labs and Swanson's. And Swanson's is much cheaper :D!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"Personally, I very much enjoyed the flavor and the tea gave me a very pleasant lift. The feeling was similar to a regular caffeine lift from coffee, but it also created a feeling of mental alertness rather than jittery.BUT --- there is some evidence that consuming too much of this in certain ways can cause health problems.I'm not trying to be a ""downer"" or rain on anyone's parade -- enjoy it if you choose. I do believe, however, that there is nothing wrong with informing people and then letting them make their choices. The studies done seem to be legitimate. The odds are against any one of you readers being harmed by yerba mate, but out of thousands of drinkers, there will likely be some who are. So this is just in the spirit of helping you make an informed decision, especially if you smoke. And I wasn't biased against it -- I REALLY did enjoy it.........[...]You can look up other studies if you choose, and disregard the ones that you believe are not convincing. But it is important to make an informed choice."

I am purchasing a second one for when we travel and have the kids in another room.Even though there is only one speed setting, you can adjust the sound pitch and volume to some extent by adjusting the air vents. In my opinion, there is really not much reason for having the second speed since you can also just put it further away to reduce the noise level."

I like that it's sugar free and has no trans fats so I can enjoy it without feeling like I'm going to have to slog through extra long workouts or that I'm hopelessly clogging my arteries.I have a fairly large mug and I make it using two mounded teaspoons of Cafe D'vita Sugar Free Mocha, 2 scant tablespoons of fat free coffee creamer and about 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee. Very satisfying. I drink it almost every day and don't have to feel guilty if I have more than one cup in a day."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,2.0,"I had high hopes for these. I mean, crunchy cheese, what's not to love? But they have more of a ""processed"" taste than I would have liked. I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag. I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to. The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese. Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors. Oh well, it was worth a try."

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I bought this after reading all the reviews. My daughter with full, long, thick hair picked up lice from somewhere. My wife thought we would have to cut her hair off, but I told her to let me try this first. We started with a good flea comb (worked good on lice, but not nits) while waiting for this to arrive in the mail. When it came she washed her hair and used conditioner to make it smooth, brushed the hair and used the NFT with the hair still damp. It was amazing what it pulled out. We did this 2 days in a row and followed with lice shampoo, and a week later when it was time to re-apply the shampoo there was nothing in her hair. We did the shampoo to be safe and a month later there has been no sign of return. The only down side is that her little brother has short hair and it really hurt his head to use the comb. I couldn't find a way to make it not hurt his head. I paid for next day air shipment and am not regretting the extra cost. It is worth any price you pay."

I was given the same tray from the same company by my VNA nurse however with the VNA logo and I adore it! So easy to fill and carry a day's supply with me. I highly recommend it.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"I purchased this unit about 3 months ago and have been somewhat dissapointed. I am on my feet alot at work and run alot outside of work, so you could say my feet are in need of some pampering! This machine has a very light touch, and i was looking for something with more umphh behind it.The roller balls are pretty useless, and the water jets are lacking in action, however the heating element is excellent. I would prefer a unit with some massaging/vibration action. I will continue to look for something to replace this unit."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I started to take BENECOL last winter. My Doctor was pressing me to get on a cholesterol medication and I was very resistant to this. A friend had recommended BENECOL since her partner was taking this and had good results.....long story short.....my cholesterol dropped around 40 points and my Doctor was so amazed that she didn't even stress over my blood pressure (it always goes up in her office).....I did follow the other guidelines that were given to me and kept my cholesterol count to 300mg a day (and that is a lot of counting).....I love the chews....and I love not having to take a prescription drug for cholesterol. Now when I see the commericals on TV about cholesterol in your blood vessels...I clearly visualize that mine are healthy and clear. THANK YOU BENECOL SMART CHEWS!!!!

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I love these because this cough suppressant is the only ingredient I need - no decongestants, etc. - when I have the cough that typically lingers after a cold. If I pop two of these before bed, I can sleep through the night, and I don't have to gag on the cherry flavored liquid."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"This soup with reduced sodium is the desired path to soup nirvana. It's the best lentil variety I've ever sampled. It's less at Stop N Shop but you have to carry home 12 unattached cans, so the free delivery to your door via Amazon is enticing and desired. I'm not a vegetarian but I do adore hot soup during the winter. Amy also markets a strictly lentil soup which they sell at Costco, but the reduced sodium content with the vegetable addition is much better."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've suffered from sleeplessness for many years and refuse to try any medications or pills to help me. After trying more than ten variety of tea brands (all still sitting in my kitchen!) to help me better sleep at night--I have found this one to work like wonders! I have been able to sleep soundly and even after waking up in the middle of the night, I am able to go back to sleep quickly. I drink a strong cup when I get home from work and throughout the evening w/dinner and have a cup sitting on my table near my bed. Even if I'm out late, I have a cup before bedtime and noticed I am able to sleep without waking up in the very early morning. I'm not sure if this will work for others who have also suffered from many nights of sleeplessness, but it sure has for me!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"What does ""high potency"" mean? Other brands tell you exactly what goes into the pill (in terms of mg). This label is ridiculously vague. Why would anyone buy the product?"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Oregon Chai tea mix is a great product for backpacking, too! It's wonderful during a winter hike.And at home, it's a nice switch from drinking coffee, regular tea, or hot chocolate. I see they've come out with a ""slightly sweet"" version, too, and I can't wait to try it.It's wonderful product with great taste! Highly recommended."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,2.0,This stuff smells good and tastes fine at first but it is way too sweet and leaves that aftertaste of fake sugar. No thanks.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is my favorite tea. We'll brew one bag in a 12oz mug for 2-3 minutes. We'll add 3 drops of stevia extract. After that, drink hot, or ice and drink cold. This is the most smooth tea I can recall and the lemon flavor is strong but not acidic."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My sister, who is a bodyworker, gave this to me about 6 months ago, and I'm ready to order another. I've used it on my feet, my shoulders, and even on my forehead and temples when I have a headache. It always works. It never doesn't work. And, unlike other sports creams, it doesn't smell. $25 seems like a lot, but 4 oz lasts a long time. You do NOT need to apply liberally. Applying sparingly works just fine."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This will be an easy review. It does just what it is suppose to do. Plus, the design is good and it is well made. It is nicely varnished and I do not know what could be done to make it better. I would never pay more for a back scratcher even though you could. I like the bamboo material it is made with. Plus, my cat saw it and thought it was some kind of cat toy (I guess--you never know what a cat is really thinking). Anyway, I scratched his back with it and the back scratcher has his approval too. I am going to but another for my office."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I am so addicted to this oatmeal. :) The taste is awesome, not dull, not too sweet, and it has a lot of great oatmeal texture and isn't mushy like other oatmeals. I like my oatmeal thick so I don't put as much water in it as recommended, and it comes out fabulous. I have it as a snack, perhaps not the healthiest choice of snack food (because of the added sugar and salt) but better than a pack of cookies or a candy bar.(I'm cracking up because I was going to make ""yummy"" a tag for this product, but someone already did!)"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"I've always enjoyed couscous, but I never tried the ""pearl"" version of it until I went to Walt Disney World and ate at an all-u-can eat Moroccan buffet at one of the parks! It's absolutely delicious! Most recipes I've seen for Israeli couscous have you adding things like tomatoes or olives, but I bought this pearl couscous from Amazon (Barry Farms) and just cooked it up using some plain chicken broth...amazing!!! There were no cooking instructions on the back of the bag so be sure to cook it 10-12 minutes using a 1-cup couscous to 2-cup liquid ratio until all the liquid is absorbed. Or I guess you could try one of the numerous recipes you can find online at various websites ([...], etc.)Oh, I almost forgot to mention that my husband was so pleased with the pearl couscous, he asked me to buy a lot more of it off Amazon! It makes a terrific side dish and it's a nice change from plain veggies or seasoned rice. Enjoy!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have had IBS and other health issues (celiac, dairy, lactose intolerant, etc) and this stuff has helped me through many bad days. I don't like to eat anything (if you have IBS you know) because when I feel bad it is not a picnic. I am a prisoner of what I eat. At least I know if I feel bad this stuff will help me through it much quicker. I don't intentionally eat bad food when I do eat, but sometimes the foods hide their poisons to my system. This is not a potent or dangerous product. It is not habit forming. But I will not leave home without it."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"This seemed to make my foot even colder. But that is probably an unfair assessment, since it was so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear it for more than ten minutes. It simply added ""and clammy"" to the description of my ""very cold"" feet. My foot might have warmed up later, there in that little straight jacket for feet. I have permacold feet due to chemotherapy, but hand warmers placed between layers of socks are far more comfortable than this. It was also a little annoying to find that I had indeed ordered a ""foot"" warmer, and not ""feet"" warmers. For that price, I kind of expected there would be two. (But of course, it does say one foot warmer, so that is really my mistake, not Thermoskin's). I like the idea of a specialty item to really warm up cold feet. For me at least, this was not it."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I have been drinking choice black tea for over 5 years. I also have my daughter drinking it every day!!!! It is organic and it is the only tea with caffeine that I drink. I recommend it 100 percent!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,These nipples work great for my baby who was breastfed for 6 months. It took us a while to find one that worked for her and this was it. She still likes the slower flow instead of the faster and she prefers the latex over silicone. Guess it's more natural...she tugs at it and bends it like she did when breastfeeding.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"My doctor told me to start drinking green tea. And since I'm not a fan of hot tea, I got an iced tea maker. I began trying different green teas, and found the sweetness in this one to hit the spot. I only like it when it's really cold, so I also got some frosty/frozen mugs to drink it from.I prefer tea bags (I use 10 to make 2 gallons) over loose leaf because it's easier to clean up, and my composter (city of SF) allows tea bags."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been taking glucosamine for years because of my knees. I was not sure the vegetarian version would work as well, but it has, because I have been taking it for two months and I have had no problems with my knees. Source Naturals also seems to be the most reasonable brand available. Other brands seem to be twice to three times the cost."

I am a woman, I have never ""sawed logs"" but I did snore, and sometimes wake up from an apnea episode. As long as I am using this product, I do not have a problem breathing, and according to those who sleep within hearing distance, I do not snore either. Might not be for everyone, but I love it and do not go to sleep without it!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I have been on 10 mgs of Lipitor for about seven years. I thought I might be able to get my cholesterol down even further by taking the chews. I don't eat meat, eat sensibly, count calories (I'm not obsessed), exercise at least three days a week, no alcohol. I've been taking the chews since February. My cholesterol is approx what it was last year (prior to the chews), 184, but my triglycerides are now in the borderline high zone. Not sure what happened but I'm off to the doctor's to see what I can do about it. I'm glad it works for some and wish it worked for me. :("
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"I have been drinking Mannheim Streamroller's Cinnamon Hot Chocolate since the year it came out. It has been a staple in my family every year since. The first year it came out, my mum and I through a huge Christmas Party. We made Mulling Cider and two big professional coffee containers of Cinnamon Hot Chocolate. They went in under an hour! That's how good it is. I grew up on Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller. I was supposed to goto American Gramophone, in Omaha, last week. Unfortunately, a huge blizzard tore through and I was stuck in my hotel room downtown. I've always wanted to visit and get some products at their home office store. Yes, if you live in Omaha, you can drive to Mormon Bridge and get some wonderful products from Chip Davis, direct. :) Buy this product! You're mouth, body, stomach, and soul will be warmed and delighted all winter long! So far, this year, I've purchased 8 Cinnamon Hot Chocolates. Trust me... it's that good! And... the best part of all... it has very little guilt when it comes to counting calories, fat, sugars, and carbs. You will actually be surprised! I drink lots of this stuff and I'm still really skinny! :) Happy Christmas to all and to all buy this product!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"My obstetrician recommended these vitamins, so I was excited to try them out. Unfortunately, the seal under the cap was broken upon arrival. In addition, the cotton layer looked like it was pushed out of the way. It was positioned such that it looked obvious that someone had placed their finger inside the bottle. The distributor, All Star Health, said that the seals sometimes get broken during the shipping process by extreme changes in temperature from hot to cold. I feel that if this is the case, the manufacturer should change their sealing technology so that the seals don't break. The distributor offered a refund, which I am taking them up on. However, the refund does not cover the shipping that I paid to get the item, or the shipping I'll pay to send the item back, so there's a $10 shipping loss on a $20-something dollar purchase."

The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment. The store brand (much cheaper with more active ingredients) worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time, and that is not Nix. Then comb, comb, comb and comb again, daily for at least 10 days."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,4.0,"I regularly buy these at the grocery store and am stoked that Amazon has them. They are delicious, with just a hint of lemon. Smooshed fruit is fun to say and easy to pack as a quick treat for my 3 year old and myself. The strawberry is especially good."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This is a great addition to a diet. It helps with hunger and also with maintaining a good level of blood sugar as it mimics insulin in a different way. Its supposed to shuttle more of the glucose in a meal into your muscle cells and away from your fat cells as opposed to insulin which shuttles it into your muscle cells and the excess into your fat cells. I used this with a low carb diet post workout(weights) with a sugary drink(2 servings gatorade ~28g carbs/sugar) to replenish my glucose stores in the muscle. The only drawback and why it gets 4 stars is because for people that have hair problems it has the potential to worsen it. I have long hair and shed more than normal, so i'm always concious of that. I noticed this would worsen the sheds, thats because the ALA does that and the reason they included biotin which is supposed to help with each hair life period. Primaforce gets some brownie points for including the biotin and thinking about the people that do not want to lose hair. Still with the biotin in it and an extra biotin supplement daily(i took in the morning) i experienced hair loss. If tried and worried just make sure to take note of any hair change and stop it if it does indeed make the hair loss any worse."

health personal care,health care,allergy,4.0,"I had a sinus infection that nothing else seemed to be working for. Usually, some kind of Benadryl will do the trick, but not this time. I had a combination runny nose/congestion, and it seemed like I was taking advil every 3 or 4 hours for facial pain. One day, I went into Walgreens and walked by some sinus rinse kits. I'd been hearing about them but never wanted to try them. Finally, I decided it was time to try one and someone at Walgreens recommended this kit. Mine has 50 packets in it, or did before I started using it.It takes a time or two to adjust to how it feels, and if you're using this while you're sick you might either need to use twice a day or more. My congestion was not *very* bad, but after two uses in one day I woke up the next day almost completely well--after being sick for about a week--and I had even felt well enough the night of those two usages to get through work without feeling bad (there was just quite a bit of nose-blowing).Most people say it doesn't burn or sting. My experience the first time I used it was that it did sting some but not badly at all. I believe this is because I had been blowing my nose a bit prior to using it and my nasal passages were a little irritated. So be aware of that if you're blowing your nose. Even with usages when I'm not sick but just feel a little congested, I certainly can feel it stinging just a little behind my eyes, especially right after/while I'm using the rinse, and can still feel the salty mix in my nasal passages/sinus stinging just a tad. I have let my mother use my kit, and she has similar issues. It's bearable and worth it, because your sinuses are clean and your nasal passages are open. It also did seem to help with clearing up both congestion and a runny nose, though I still had the tingly sensation that leads to sneezing in my nose.Other things"

health personal care,health care,incontinence,3.0,This product gets the job done but is really small. I have now ordered the medium size and am very happy with the product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Excellent product, and it doesn't get me dizzy like No-Explode always used to. Blue Raspberry tastes great, btw. A lot of people say not to take this with food because it will upset one's stomach or give them gas. To those out there wondering, I want to add that I've never experienced this, and it really depends on your body. I take Superpump 250 almost every morning with my oatmeal and eggs, and I've never had a gas/stomach/runs problem. I always though that the directions recommended taking it on an empty stomach because it will be more powerful this way (the caffeine is absorbed more quickly). Point is, everyone reacts differently to these things. I happen to have VERY little response to nitric oxide supplements, so I take this for the caffeine, vitamin b, and what little creatine it has."
baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"This food mill is so fantastic and here's why:1. It's portable.2. It's easy to clean.3. It makes portions that are just the right size.For my first daughter I made large batches of baby food in our blender and froze them...and she wouldn't eat it at all. Maybe I was doing something wrong in the reheating process but she would only eat the food when it was fresh so I just gave up and started buying baby food.With our second daughter, I wasn't going to make the same mistake. I came so close to buying the Beaba Babycook (steamer/blender combo...expensive) but after reading on the Soulemama blog about this food mill, I decided I should try it. It's such a reasonable price that I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't work out. Well, it turned out to be exactly what we needed! I cook a meal for our family and put one or more of the items in the food mill to feed to our daughter. Right now she's eating only one food at a time but soon I'll be adding more elements of our meal into her food mill for her to enjoy...so simple. Plus, if we eat a restaurant or travel to visit family, I can slip it right into our diaper bag.I highly recommend this food mill."

I've found after 5 years, I cannot live without my T3(thyroid medication), Fivelac, Thorne Mediclear & a Ph Balanced Diet - otherwise I cannot function enough to keep all my affairs in order. After trying a zillion products, practitioners & spending thousands of $$$$ - this is what I've been left with. BTW - if u have a dianosed hypothyroid - go see an endocrinologist!

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Before I bought this, I asked my doctor if she'd ever heard of the brand, pretty much expecting her to say, ""Of course, I use Bluebonnet margarine all the time!"" but, in fact, she was familiar with this supplement and said it'd be perfectly good to take. Like another reviewer here, I noticed that my nighttime foot cramps vanished almost immediately -- though, to balance the picture, that also may have been the case when I was taking Citrical alone. (I take Citrical Calcium + D in addition to Bluebonnet -- too neurotic to rely on any one brand to protect my bones!) The advantage of this formula is how pleasant and easy the liquid is to take compared to the usual horse pills that calcium comes in -- so while the pill-taking feels like a chore, having a spoon or two of this fruity liquid seems more like a treat, which means you'll be less likely to skip a dose. In the back of my mind, I have a little concern over the lack of a ""USP Verified"" mark, which would give some level of assurance that this Bluebonnet stuff does indeed contain what the label says it does. But it seems like an honest product, so until I turn on CNN and see Bluebonnet execs being led off in handcuffs in ""Calcium Crisis 2012,"" I'll keep on taking it."

health personal care,health care,unknown,1.0,"I get extreme ear pain on planes and nothing used to work. I get it regardless of allergies or colds. I tried sweets, gum, medicines and nothing worked except ear plugs. Plain old ear plugs.. I squish them and pull on the top of my ear to get them in good and I wear them for the first hour until I am we are done ascending. Then when it gets near to going down I put them in again. The trick is to get them in early. Any kind of descent will make my ears hurt immediately. Anyways for my last flight I bought these earplanes thinking they would be even better then earplugs and no way. They didnt work at all. I got pain right away and had to take them out and get my old trusty earplugs. If you are nervous you should wear the plugs throughout the whole flight but if its a long flight then it should be okay to take them out once you are up and level. Hope this helps!!"

Well, tiny may be a superlative.Based on the size of the tomatoes, it appears that you could place about 8-10 tomatoes inside to process. Instead, three normal sized tomatoes or maybe 4-Roma tomatoes will just about fill up the basket/hopper.The size is promoted at about 2-1/2 quarts, however, I would estimate this to hold about 3 cups. Beyond that and it starts to overflow, especially when occasionally you back it up to clear the skins and seeds from the sieve.On the positive side, it is a solidly built tool, ready to to take the seeds out of chokecherry so I can make some more wine."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This tea is different than English or Irish tea and is superior to both. There is a certain malty taste that is evident and a lovely copper colour to the tea itself. I would highly recommend it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After I begun taking this multivitamin, I feel better. Some times I can't eat well because that too much demands in my job but this vitamins keep me, Flu is very strange to me, is my second bottle of 325 tablets for my mom, dad and my girlfriend...and with amazon is just superb, hope they keep selling this."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,We loved this item. if you have the money it is great. Problem is that you dont need the item for long so it is pricey for that reason. If I have another child I would get the microwave one. It works great though
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,3.0,"I've had several of Dr. McDougall's soup cups and liked them all. The taste on this was really good, but I was highly disappointed that there were two servings in this one cup."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,1.0,"I purchased this product and have sent me another with the excuse, telling me the same. So my question is to put this on sale, but they do."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have not tried this specific item. Although I have had Caffe del Doge espresso and it is great. There are two locations in downtown Palo Alto Ca, in case you'd like to try the coffee before making the amazon purchase.419 University and 95 University Palo Alto, one on the streets downtown and the other at the Palo alto train station."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"We use this thermometer for our infant, and it's fairly accurate. We usually have to perform 3-5 readings, and we go by the average. An example of one run would be 97.8, 97.9, 98.2, 97.8. We're really happy with it because it's too difficult to take her temperature accurately without measuring rectally. (Yuck! Who wants to do that?) Should we suspect my toddler has a fever, we will be using it on him as well."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I bought this product because it holds 4 dividers instead of 3. I don't have a hard time twisting it to go to the other divider for the formula, but it is a bit hard to open. I do not sterilize this for, I think, it is not in the instructions to do so. I just clean it with mild soap and warm water and leave it out to air dry. I have read in other reviews that it only holds 2 scoops. No it does not. It holds upto 4 scoops of formula. The powder comes out fine especially when you tap it in the bottle, unlike what the other review said. Another review complained about the color, which I thought was kinda weird. The color looks fine for me. The dispenser is a bit large than normal, but probably because its a 4-divider dispenser.I did not give it a 5-star because it is hard to open and you are worrying you might spill the powder inside if you are trying to open it. But all in all, a good value for the money."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These Potassium Iodide pills are the only ones FDA recommended, and the same pills distributed to people living near nuclear reactors in case of a radiation release. I recommend them over the cheeper (but less effective) Potassium IodATE because the absorptive nature of KiO3 (iodate) is less known, and they are packed in a simple plastic bottle. The Foil pack of the iOSAT pills is much better for long term storage and tracking dosage."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have used this product for years, as a matter of fact I bought two so I can always have one ready. I keep it in the freezer and use it to provide comfort at night. Every night, I get in bed and then ask my husband to ""go get the thing"". I also use when I get migraines. Don't get me wrong, this won't cure a true migraine - likely need some real medicine - but it provides a great deal of comfort while I am waiting for the drugs to work. It is just the right weight to provide some relief when placed over eyes. I highly recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,5.0,"Buffalo Bills Premium SnacksI realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.First, customer service is excellent. I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.So far I've ordered the following products:1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short ShotsThe first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra SmokeysThese are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)Taste great if you are a jerky lover.5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni Short ShotsProbably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots6) Big Buffalo Ole SmokiesFatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.7) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey StrungO.K. taste. My wife hates the smell. My Brother doesn't care much for them either.All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.Gunner January, 2010"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is, bar none, the finest whey protein powder I have ever tasted. Whey has become a staple in my house ever since I started doing Body for Life and P90X, but I have grown concerned over time with artificial sugars and unnecessary ingredients.I started out using Myoplex, then switched to a whey protein complex made by GNC. Both are fantastic, but nevertheless I've been searching for a product to take me to a higher level. Until finding the all-natural whey from ON, I wasn't sure that would even be possible.One taste and I knew I had entered a whole new stratosphere. I'm convinced it's ON's micro-filtration process that yields the finest whey protein I've ever seen (or tasted) in my life. You're talking to a vanilla junkie here, so my expectations are high. I have rejected more than a few inferior products that tasted like a cure for ulcers or acid reflux.As soon as my ON delivery came, I opened the lid and inhaled. While not quite the pure hit of vanilla I was anticipating, it still invited me to wet a finger and taste for myself.OMG -- I could eat this dry for dessert. The consistency is so fine that the scoop settled all the way to the bottom of the container during shipment! I have never -- never -- come across a whey that tasted so good.I'll check back in if my shakes don't deliver over the course of a series of workouts. But based on what I've tasted (and seen) so far, ON protein will become a staple in my household. You can't beat the bang for the buck, especially from amazon.I've finally found the product I want at a price that's fair. I will be buying it from now on at regular intervals. No scouring at the local vitamin store. No fearing the price gouge at the register.Thank you, amazon. Rev up your workouts, people... and bring it, ON!"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,Worthless. The temperature readings are usually off by two degrees compared to rectal readings. Whenever we take the kid's temperatures we add two degrees. If it's high (over 96.6) we use the rectal thermometer to get an accurate reading. Also the temperature varies widely. You can take readings several different times and get very different readings each time. Stick to traditional thermometers.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,3.0,"I've tried many, many, many varieties of gluten-free pasta over the course of the last four years, and this one just doesn't stack up. It's very easy to overcook, and quite bland. Having said that, I've found the best way to cook it is to bring water to a boil, empty the pasta into the water, return to a boil, cover the pot and remove it from the heat. Remove the lid after five minutes and stir the contents. Return the lid to its place, and leave it for another 4-5 minutes. Even when cooked this way, it's still far too chewy and starchy.I've had much better luck with Tinkyada, although I'll try whatever's new on the market. Glutino also makes a pasta comparable to Tinkyada, but that costs a bit more."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,This is my favorite hot sauce. It's the hottest stuff I've ever tasted. It's great with a little BBQ sauce on wings.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"I first ordered this to try out after purchasing The Vegenomicon, which had recipes using it. It sounded intriguing, something different, so I ordered from Amazon, I can't find it in my area. It's a sweet rice cooking wine and there's a lot you can do with it, I don't limit myself to cookbooks. I've been ordering it from Amazon ever since. Those who love to cook will love this product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,"Unsalted organic corn chips are the absolute best choice when entertaining. Tortilla chips almost always accompany salsa or nacho cheese sauce and additional salt found with other chips can become overwhelming. The sweet corn goodness is great while eating these alone and not necessarily requiring a complimenting side-kick. You cannot go wrong by having an available supply in your pantry to serve whenever guests crave a snack or as a personal snack or meal ingredient. I also purchased a case of the elRio brand (my choice was mild) nacho cheese sauce from Amazon and it was a perfect match to these chips. Having something extra on hand is always a blessing when a group of children drop in to play PS2 and suddenly want something to eat. That is my household, and also why I love Amazon."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"The ovulation test strips are way cheaper and work just as well as ones from the drug store. I used these along with charting my basal body temperature. It may have been a coincidence, but I got pregnant the first month using these. If anything else, using these strips are a good reference point for when ovulation occurs."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I had to return this item because it was way too small for my husband. I think that it was a woman's medium, not a man's. It also seemed too delicate for a man. I either misread the describtion, or something.Louise Shoksnyder"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I've been using this product, as directed, for one month.I have to say that the pill size is just too big, and the price of these pills just isn't practical because the quantity doesn't last due to the amount you have to take each day.I haven't seen any respectable gains and am just not satisfied with the results of taking this product. I think I'll just stick to my Pro-5 Protein Powder, liquid creatine, and a phytonutrient supplement; combined with a heathly diet and exercise. That has always seemed to work the best for me! Thanks for reading."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I really like this foot massager. I bought this one as well as the Therapeutic Foot and Body Roller from the Happy Company. I like both but if you were to just get one, then I would got with the Therapeutic Foot and Body roller. It is a little bigger but also more effective."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,...but this stuff is great for exfoliating and surprisingly gentle. It even takes callouses off with some scrubbing! I use it to scrub my entire body if I'm really dirty or to give my skin a nice glow before a special occasion; you can add some to a tub for a luxurious soak if you have time to relax or grab a handful on the way into the shower. There's a separate product from Seacret for use on your face but I'll admit to using this on my face when I'm in a hurry and it does a nice job of helping clear up your t-zone. I can't say enough for all of the Seacret products but this one is a special favorite (my fiance even bought me a jar for Christmas this year--good man!) and I give it five stars.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment. Grainy, squishy, and if they even got slightly cool they'd harden up. Or they'd just fall apart in the pot if they weren't carefully watched.Then an online friend recommended Tinkyada.I bought a package. Just one. I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. My non GF'ers in the house couldn't even tell the difference from their regular veggie dyed pasta. The taste, texture, and ability to be al dente unlike most other GF pasta's makes this pasta the King of All GF Pasta's in my house. We've tried all the various pasta's that Tinkyada makes by this point and not a single one has disappointed us.The ONLY con to this pasta is if you don't use it all at once, and refrigerate it for later. It tends to get stiff and grainy feeling. However, my 15 yo GF daughter microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes with about a TB of water and then puts them in a microwave safe dish to take to school for lunch. Just those few minutes with some extra water fixes the issue no problems.All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I've been a fan of Carbquik baking mix for sometime. After a few experiments, it has become a staple in my kitchen. With that said, I wouldn't recommend paying this price for it--it's exhorbitant. I found it much cheaper at netrition. Until reviewers hold amazon vendors accountable for overpricing, they'll continue to do so."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I recently made a life change of what foods to eat, and one change was to go to whole grain foods. I never had Bulgar Wheat before but found it delicious, especially with fresh bluberries, bananas, etc. You can make some extra and keep it in the fridge for a quick breakfast on another day that is just as good as the first day you made it. This is a good price for the quantity you get."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This product is a dried whole whey powder. It is excellent for adding a ""milky"" flavor to mixes or baked goods. The product is essentially fat and gluten free, and dissolves immediately in liquids. However, this product contains lactose, lots of it, and if you are lactose intolerant this product may not be for you. For those of us who enjoy dairy products, whey is a wonderful flavoring agent and contributes a lot of protein to mixes."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"Burns, Cuts, Scrapes, Itchy Patches ... You name it this product is like a ""wonder product""... I bought my boxes with total confidence. I found this product once on a store shelf, and sure enough, burned my finger on the oven rack. Used this product and over night (truely within hours) there was relief and healing. You will love this product. I have now used it for the most odd things, just to see if it would help, and it did. The mosquito bite that was driving me crazy... stopped... the paper cut that was so sore ... stopped... I recommend this product as a 10 + Star Product !!!"

health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"My initial purchase of this product was via the ""subscribe and save"" option. The price was a most reasonable $36. Then, when the second delivery arrived, the price had almost doubled, without notice. When I contacted Amazon customer service to complain, the representative seemed puzzled by the price discrepancy and gave me a credit on the difference.I've noticed in the last few days the price fluctuating significantly again.I'm of the opinion that when one signs up for a ""subscription"" that one should be able to lock in a price or at least be offered the opportunity to amend terms of the subscription if the price changes as significantly as it did with this product.As for the quality of the product itself, it's for my mother who lives in an assisted-living facility, so it's hard to gauge. I will say that my subscription experience has really soured me on the Prevail company."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I love Mental Clarity, but if you're a vegetarian, don't purchase the product from this seller. The version they sent me was not vegcap and had catfish listed as an ingredient! New Chapter's Mental Clarity really works, though."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"This pad gave me good temporary topical relief for severe neck pain and headache. It went on easily and adhered very well, much better than the more expensive Bengay patch which worked loose at the edges. There was no strong ointment smell (unlike the strong Menthol of the Bengay patch) and no more than a mild burning sensation which soon eased. This is a very good topical remedy at a good price."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,The soft flexible design of the heating pad is exactly what I was looking for! It incredibly comfortable.unfortunatly the pad just does not get hot enough to give any pain relief which is ultimatly the most important benefit of this product - I will have to go back to the terrible plastic cheapo heating pad I was using.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"this is not a review of the product, but a short blurb about my experience with ordering this item from Brookstone, via amazon. My receipt is labled brookstone and the communications were with brookstone, through amazon. I rated the item four stars so as to not terribly skew the ratings.I tried to return an unused footbath. I purchased this item from Brookstone, through amazon.com. The package arrived as scheduled, shipped from Brookstone with a Brookstone receipt and no amazon receipt. My wife decided she did not need the item and requested I return it. I went through the amazon site which linked me to Brookstone customer service.I sent an email to Brookstone from the amazon website, inquiring about the return policy, this is what I received:""We want you to be satisfied with every item you purchase from us. If a product purchased at Brookstone does not meet your expectations, you may return it with a receipt either to a Store or to our Returns Processing Center within 60 days of purchase (some exceptions apply). All returns must be new, unused, and contain all original packaging and accessories. Returns made within 30 days of purchase with the original purchase receipt are eligible for exchange or refund..""So to me that meant I could take the unused Foot Bath in it's original container, to any brookstone, with my receipt to get a full refund. Let me just add that the item was shipped to me from Brookstone and not amazon and had a receipt labeled ""Brookstone"" with the return policy written on the back. The return policy was as stated above as well.So what happened was a flat out denial by the store manager to accept the return. I had to argue with her for several minutes about getting a refund. She said since i purchased it from Amazon, although through the Brookstone store, she said I couldn't exchange it. I even told her about the email i received saying that I could. I ended up having to call customer service while I was in the store. I was told that yes, indeed, I could return the item to any store. HOWEVER, if i returned it to the store, i could only get a store gift card and that I could only get my money back if I mailed it to them.So talk about ""misstatements""....This was totally in contradiction to their return policy. Oh and by the way, while we were there, another customer was trying to return their foot bath."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,As someone milk allergic it's insanely difficult to find ramen that has no milk-based ingredients and that is not made on equipment shared with dairy. Tradition's products are not made to cater to the allergic but being Kosher parve means they're suitable. Since they're parve they should also be fine for vegans although I haven't looked into it.They have a taste almost identical to your standard beef cup noodle. The vegetables rehydrate nicely and the noodles don't swell up hideously if you let it sit for longer than directed. I was quite pleased since these were the first ramen I've been able to eat in about three years.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I was looking for an adjustable well padded stool for the long hours that I spend in front of an artists easel. This seems to be it. The firm deep padding was a welcome relief after the progression of bar stools and ""ergonomic"" kneeling stools that I've tried and discarded. This stool is comfortable, stable, easily adjusted, quiet, and rolls easily. The base is molded plastic, but appears to be solidly designed and constructed. It assembled quickly with only four screws and a Phillips screwdriver. It was well packed and easy to unpack. While it might have been nice if they'd thought to include assembly instructions, it wasn't really necessary since from the picture it's obvious how the parts fit together (seat on top, wheels on bottom).Update a year and a half later. I use this stool a lot. I had to put some shoe glue on a side seam that was starting to split, but it's still in great condition and very comfortable."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I started taking Planetary Herbals 600mg St. John's Wort almost 4 months ago. I was hesitant to buy these pills on Amazon because it didn't have any ratings or feedback, but I am pleasantly surprised on how well it has worked for me.I have suffered with major depression and mild anxiety for years. I found out that it was going to cost me an arm and a leg to see and doctor and get medication (being that I don't have health insurance) So, I decided to order this product.Almost 4 months later, I am happy to report that my major depression has transformed into a minor depression - and my anxiety has lessened somewhat.I have been having VERY VIVID DREAMS. So much so that I was scared that it was not normal to have such vivid dreams. I went off the supplement (as I call it)for a few days - and that was a stupid mistake on my part. I will not go off this again. My dreams are deep, and I can remember them when I wake up. It's very silly to say this - but it's almost a spiritual experience when I sleep.All my dreams have been good since starting this medication.My life and my dreams have been improved by this supplement, and I have nothing negative to say about it.Note"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,Taste very similar to a high quality fudgesicle; this mix very easy to use. I was very happy with the product.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"To be honest, for the price, this is very good Balsamic Vinegar. I know that the price is rather low for quality vinegar and I was a bit leery of that aspect being a firm believer in that you get what you pay for. In this case that old saying just did not apply. As inexpensive as this is, the quality is actually quite high.I use quite a lot of this stuff in my cooking and a very large number of my salad dressings have this as an ingredient. It would take an extremely sophisticated taste to tell this product from the more expensive vinegars and for everyday cooking I find that this Manicardi #12 more than fits the bill. Frankly, I was rather amazed at what I got for my money here.Like all Balsamic Vinegars, it takes a bit of experience to know where the cut off point is and where too much is too much...this product is no exception to that rule. A light hand at first is the best policy.I highly recommend this. You get the taste you want, the essence, without having to sell off an expensive piece of jewelry each time you cook or whip a salad into being."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I am currently taking an anti-anxiety med, Paxil. It is notorious for causing weight gain. With the Relacore, it balanced out the Paxil and helped me lose the excess weight I had gained WITHOUT the jitters or restlessness! It does curb your appetite. I was an emotional eater and it helped stop this! I lost the weight within 2 months (about 8lbs). :) I felt much calmer and relaxed and wasn't constantly wanting to snack. I highly recommend this product! :)"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift, and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water, because in the past that always results in a weak flavor. Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in myAladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lilythen add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Even though I am a vegetarian, this was my first time buying nutritional yeast. I recommend that anyone considering this for their child should get a sample or smaller package first. I have been searching for milk alternatives for my son since discovering he has an allergy to milk. He is fine with all types of soy cheeses so far and I thought this would be a good alternative to soy.I have tried preparing him 'mac n' cheese' twice- once using the recipe on the bag and once trying my own recipe and both times my four year old said 'yuck, is this a special type of cheese?'. My 2 year old seems to be OK with it, but I think it upset her belly.I am very satisfied with the quality and taste of this product and I am happy to have the extra B vitamins in my diet. I think it does upset my stomach slightly, but I am not completely positive about that.Unfortunately, I might find it difficult to work my way through 4 bags that I had bought to share with my son. I found the taste to be pleasant, a little bit like cheese, but there is also a slight off-taste to it that children might not like. The best I can describe it is slightly bitter, or earthy. Which is fine, but just don't expect your child to love it like I did after reading all the positive reviews."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,eggs,3.0,"I rarely buy eggs and when I do I have to think of ways to use the leftovers before they spoil. So I bought a container of Just Whites to keep conveniently in the cabinet. I thought it would be great to have around anytime I wanted to make something and not have to go to the store to buy eggs or worry about having more than I needed, but I don't like using this product. The powder is ridiculously sticky, making it difficult to use. When mixing with water like the instructions say the powder simply sticks to the fork or whisk in clumps and won't combine with the liquid. It has replaced egg whites in some baked goods I've used it for but Just Whites has been more of an annoyance than a convenience."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"This heating pad worked good as far as heat,but only lasted for about 2 years. When it was working, the cover wouldn't stay on, then it started working intermittently after about a year...now it is not working at all, except for the light but no heat. Wouldn't buy sunbeam again. I want something that I don't have to constantly replace."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Nice mints with caffeine for a decent price. There are roughly 75 mints per tin, 3 mints equal a soda, they are peppermint, they taste great and last a decent amount of time and the tin looks nice. I like these for a quick pick-me-up during the day and they leave the breath fresh smelling. Will buy again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product works very well. I've been buying this brand for a long time. I used to purchase the smaller size until I found this larger size container. I prefer the natural, not flavored version so I can add it to orange juice or other flavored liquids. The contents are always extremely fresh so even though it's a large container it will stay fresh a long time."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Beta Carotene is a precursor to vit A. The body makes as much vit A as it needs from it without the possibility of getting too much vit A.Years ago I had a green lung infection and didn't want antibiotics. I took 6 of these NOW Beta-Carotene (25,000 IU) pills at once, several times a day and my lung infection cleared up. Very cool.Now my husband and I take these regularly at smaller doses for prevention (along with vit D and other stuff). If needed we up the dose for a day or so but we haven't been ill since."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Iced tea is one of my favorite drinks and this Lipton Cold Brew pack makes it easy to make. Now, ordering from Amazon has made it even cheaper to make.Boxes of 22 Pitcher bags have been going for around 5+ dollars at my local supermarket and drop to around 4 dollars on sale. It hasn't been cheap but since these bags make it so easy to make the tea and taste pretty good I have continued to buy it. Until I saw Amazon was selling the same tea at a cheaper price. To purchase a box of 12 (which I realistically couldn't do before since the market rarely had that many to begin with) would have run me around 60+ dollars. Amazon is much cheaper (about half the price) and I now have the convenience of not having to go out to get a couple new boxes every few weeks. This 12 pack of boxes should last my family around 4-5 months.This stuff tastes like tea and isn't sweetened or has flavors or anything like that. If that is what you want though you can definitely add whatever your heart desires to make it taste as you want, but this just the Tea without any of the stuff - it is great. It is pretty quick, you can just throw a couple bags into a large pitcher and then just wait for it to act. A few minutes later you add some ice and you have a iced tea, it really is that simple.If you haven't had it before, 12 boxes of it is quite a large commitment and it is probably worth going to the local store and picking up a box to try out first before taking the plunge, especially if you're not that big on tea or you are a big tea snob and are particular about how it tastes.Each box is individually sealed, so you don't have to worry that when you open the pack you'll open all of them and they come in a large box for easy storage."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I opted to exclusively pump instead of breastfeeding as my son had problems latching on. I rented a hospital-grade pump (the Medela Lactina Select) from a local pharmacy, but it's a huge pump that's inconvenient to drag around with you. This seemed to be a good take-along pump.The upside is that it is easily transported. It does have vibration that helps with stimulation, so it was able to help me get milk supply back when it started to taper off.The downsides is that it's incredibly LOUD. I would not find this something you'd take to a place where you want to be discreet. I also have to watch because sometimes the valve doesn't open and let the milk drain into the bottle, so if it backs up it leaks out. Mine also will only work if I have it plugged in- batteries don't seem to do anything.It does have the option of changing the suction, but it almost feels more like there's only 2 variations, and unless you work your way up to the strongest, it's extremely painful at first. I also found that it's easier if you don't use the silicone insert because it has a hard time creating suction when that's in place. It also took me nearly and hour to use as it's not strong enough to really pull milk out quickly.Overall, it's good if you have another pump that really works and you just need something to get you by in a quick pinch, but if you're going to only use one pump, I'd recommend buying something a little nicer."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"I bought a box of the chocolate-coconut when it was on a lightning deal previously. When I think ""chocolate and coconut"" I think Mounds bar, and that's exactly what this tastes like, if you took a Mounds bar and replaced it with a giant hunk of dirt. This is no way tastes like chocolate. Stay away unless you actually like the taste of carob (which is fine, they just shouldn't call it chocolate), or you're one of those people who think Diet Coke tastes at all like regular Coke, in which case you clearly have no sense of taste anyway, so have at it."

Now I have discovered that with no explanation, and no way of finding out why, it will no longer be shipped to Alaska! Weird. I am not impressed by the service, though the product was all right. Not as good as Nature Made, but all right."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Of all the whey proteins, Optimum Nutrition Gold is the best. The thing I like most about it is the texture. It has more substance to it than the average whey protein; therefore, it mixes better with beverages, hot or cold. The vanilla flavor is really a true vanilla taste."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,3.0,"It's cheap, simple, and does the job. Yes, it does leave some black mineral residue after each use, but it's no big deal. Just rinse it out when you refil the water. Due to the nature of my tap water, I need to add a tiny amount of salt to the water in order for it to boil.It's cheap. No moving parts. No need to worry about mold because I just throw the whole thing away after one season."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,salsas,5.0,"I LOVE this salsa so much I came on Amazon to add it to my wishlist. I usually buy this salsa at Publix, but when i went there last week they were sold out and I was not happy. I guess next time I will buy two of them. I love Mexican food and lived in the southwest before so I know GREAT salsa. And for a jar salsa, this is very good, for a verde jar salsa, its the best I have had. It reminds me of the verde salsa I've had near the southwestern border except not as fresh, but it still doesn't have that nasty jar taste. I live far from Mexico now and it is very hard to find great salsa."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I started using this product a few months ago when I read about giving coconut oil to my black shih tzu Pucci as a dietary supplement. He liked it immediately and his coat is glossy and his skin unblemished. I have also smooshed some into his hair before his bath as a conditioner with great success. I started eating it myself - it has a very pleasant, mild taste - and I apply it to my hair and skin before a shower which makes even my hard feet smooth and soft without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. I thought the claims of a miracle product were merely the swoons of hippie health nuts but this product has enhanced my life and the life of my dog. I like Nutiva products in general so that is why I chose it for the coconut oil and it seems wonderful in all aspects. It is part of my routine now. This size jar also seems to be an excellent value for a quality product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,My family loves poppy seed bread and I must say that these poppy seeds have the best flavor and they are so fresh. I keep one package in the refrigerator to use and store the rest in the freezer for later. I originally bought them to save money. The little jars you buy in the store are extremely expensive and you only get two loaves of bread out of them. I would definitly recommend buying these.

Heartburn producer, so take with a little bit of food. Remember to keep tablet away from light or else they change color? Decent product, not a big ""energy"" producer as hyped."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Order came quickly. Since Bigelow tea bags are individually wrapped, they last forever, so buying in bulk makes sense here. I see it for $3.50 a box in the store, so getting it at ~$2 a box is definitely worth it."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,Looked all over for this popcorn after receiving my Waring Pro 2oz. popcorn maker for my kids for christmas. Could not find any pre-packaged popcorn for the 2oz. maker. I found this on Amazon less than 2 weeks before Christmas and had it wrapped and ready to go in plenty of time. This popcorn tastes wonderful. Friends and family love it and I will keep on ordering this as long as my popcorn maker keeps popping. This package makes just enough for two kids at snack time and two paks for the adults also. Very pleased.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"We purchased this massager/ottoman for my wife who has MD and RLS. The first time she tried it the fingers grabbed her calves and ankles so severely that she let out a surprising yell. I thought maybe she had overeacted and tried it myself. Let me tell you this massager was so hard on my legs that I was afraid it was going to leave some serious brusies. The force with which it grabs is painful and you can't wait until it lets go so you can away from it. I thought perhaps it may have been because of the size of my legs. I then put my wrist and forearm in the thing and trust me it was the same hard squeeze. In the end it hurt so bad that we packed it up sent it back. There was no way that this was going to be usable. I might add that re-shipping was not cheap and with the restocking charge this was a pretty expensive proposition and experience. We would not, and cannot reccomend this item unles you are a macocist. Sorry to say this is not a human touch product."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm not going to go on and on about this product - except to say - this stuff really works. My youngest son is autistic along with being pretty hyper. He couldn't stay focused on anything for more than 5-10 minutes. Shopping for an omega type product, I happened to stumble on Coromega. I read the reviews, read the history of the product, dived in and ordered it.OK, I'm not one to spew much, but LORD this product works! In about two weeks, my boy has gone from being able to focus for only 5-10 minutes to 30 minutes! Can you believe that?? My husband and I are stoked. Again, (sorry if I'm beating a dead duck) we couldn't get our boy to focus on anything; now this product has really changed most of that. Of course there are still challenges, but Coromega has made it so much easier to face those challenges.I will never be without this product again - ever! By the way, we're all taking it now and it has even helped my 15 year old focus better on his home work. Purchase this product, you won't be sorry:0)"

It doesn't exist!! This was my favorite spaghetti sauce on the planet. I would buy this stuff online by the case. Maybe Kraft could just make the spaghetti sauce available for purchase or if they don't intend to ever put this product into production again, a cook book with a recipe for this in it would rock also."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"My husband and I eat this every morning and never tire of it. Leagues better than American oatmeal ... wish we could get somebody here to start milling oatmeal this way. We call our morning bowl the oatmeal souffle. Not gluey. Light and delicious. I adapt the recipe on package to 1/3 cp oat flakes per serving, with one cp water. Always soak first or cook to boiling at medium. If you get distracted and it thickens too much add a bit more boiling water, cook a minute or two longer, and serve. Lowers cholesterol; great source of fiber."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,Cannot buy this product locally. Quality was excellent. Each package is enough for two plus meals for two people so it was worth the shipping.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"I love the product, but the stock the Amazon sent me was about 8 months passed the best before date stamped on the box.Make sure that your product is fresh and safe for consumption by verifying the BEST BEFORE DATE!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre, so why not cut back on quality and cruise on the Twinings name. Judging by the stellar reviews of their product, they made a smart business decision. They bought cheap leaves and dumbed down the taste to a brackish, uninteresting non-event.Compare this stuff with Tazo English Breakfast tea; you'll taste a hige difference. There are probably some other good E.B. teas out there, but Tazo is fairly widely available in my area. Sadly, Lipton followed the Twining trend toward mediocrity, so they're no better."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"Bought this at the supermarket because it was on sale. Very pleasantly surprised! I think it tastes as good as any standard take-out joint. Good flavor and texture with a little kick. The prep is a *little* more complicated than your average microwave meal, but definitely worth it."

I recommend this wondeful massager for the anyone with aches and pains, and who doesn't have a personal massager. If you have to do things by your self this is the massager to buy.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I highly recommend this pump .It works as efficiently as Lansinoh Double Electric Pump (I have both).Less parts to clean and very easy to assemble.With my last baby I had a Medela PIS and I am not exaggerating but even PIS can't beat the ease of use and results of this pump.I can express more milk with in 10 minutes as compared to double pumping by Lansinoh Electric pump.I can easily fill the 5+ oz bottle(the one came with this pump) within 10-15 mins .So for me this can't get any better than this.This is one purchase you won't regret.Priced very afford-ably too.I would have paid much more for this pump in a heartbeat.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"This is perhaps the easiest, most neutral tasting GF bread mix I have tried yet. It was the first I bought, and it made my GF transition much simpler.You CAN mix this by hand. I tried a single box first to be sure, then came here and ordered a case. It makes a large, 'normal' looking loaf of bread. The texture is wonderful for the first 2-3 days, then I slice what's left and store in my freezer until I need another slice. Try the Cinnamon Raisin bread recipe and make french toast for a real treat! Play around with the recipe. Try it with milk, then water. Try it with butter, then oil. Eggs, or egg-less. My personal combo is oil, eggs, and 3/4 water to 1/4 milk.The cons? A bit crumbly, and not enough 'chew' to the bread to pretend you are eating a rustic bread. All and all though...you can't go wrong starting your gluten free journey here."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how good these are, especially compared to regular crispy bars. They have a nice peanut butter flavor that's quite tasty without being overwhelmingly sweet. My 7 year old finished one and then immediately asked if we could start putting them in her lunch or snack for school. They're also a good size, so I'll probably toss one into my bag for a snack on occasion also. One box of 6 bars is over five dollars at my local grocery store; this is an awesome price and I'll definitely be ordering them from Amazon from now on."

We first tried the tea bags, which were handy, however, we prefer the loose tea. If you like Earl Grey tea try this one you will like it!"

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I like to make my positive reviews as educational, encouraging, helpful and authentic as possible. My sugar-loving, ultra-nit-picky, processed-food-loving family members have all flown the coop so I'm FINALLY re-learning high-nutrition cooking (like Mother Earth News had inspired me towards 20+ years ago) and these Bob's Red Mill products are making my transition super-easy, tasty, creative and fun. This Natural Granola was the first `Bob's' item that I had tried out because I knew it would be more versatile for adding into other recipe's and I could simulate his other granola mixes because I always keep spices and dried fruit bits on hand (for adding to foods AND ESPECIALLY to reconstitute for natural sweeteners).~ THE #1 THING THAT I""VE LIKE THE BEST ABOUT THIS GRANOLA is that it seems so filling to me that I've naturally and effortlessly reduced my portions, which is important for getting our stomach's back to a healthy / natural size without unpleasant brain associations or, in my case triggering my hypoglycemia). THE #1 ADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE WOULD BE HOW PHENOMINALLY VERSATILE THIS NATURAL GRANOLA IS FOR COUNTLESS DISHES & MEALS, SOOooo NEVER assume that healthier eating has to be tasteless, bland or boring !!~ Breakfast Suggestions"

I've consumed them while mountain climbing and running long distances.

I also have to hand it to Clif for making the packaging convenient - it's easy to keep on the move and eat these."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This product is great. For those who have notice no after taste like the packets it's because the packets contain the caking agents which is what you are tasting.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Dim Plus is a wonderful product for most people. Unfortunately, it caused me crippling headaches. It took me 2 weeks to realize it was the product causing the headaches. They were not your average type headache either, but the kind that hurts to even move. I did not take any pills yesterday and this morning is the first time since starting Dim plus that I woke up headache free."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I am not sure why there are not more warming blankets that do not auto shut off after a few hours or cost a lot of money. These do just what we needed. We bought two, one for each cat and only turn them off when we leave for a long period of time and during the warmer days. They are priced right and keeping them on low is just what the cat ordered."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Had to search quite a bit to find an enteric coated B-Complex vitamin and was glad to find this product.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,My daughter wanted to try Japansese candy because she had read about it. She said this product was chewy and sweet. It was definitely different. It reminded me of homemade citrus candy. If you like chewy sweets you will like it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love these prenatal vitamins. Unlike the ones I've used in the past (over the counter and prescription), these do not upset my stomach at all or make me constipated. I prefer the Prenatal One vitamin over its sister vitamin (the Prenatal System) which makes you take 6 pills a day."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This was my second purchase of Alive. I have been using it for about four months now and I can really tell the difference with increased energy and just an overall healthier feeling every day. It's tough to describe without experiencing it for yourself. I try to eat right and exercise, but I'm sure I'm missing a ton of nutrients each day. I feel that Alive is giving me that. It's a great multi-vitamin with the only side effect being increased energy. It's not a sugar or caffeine induced burst of energy, but I'm just not exhausted at the end of every day as I used to be. I can take a tablet and go right to sleep.I have IBS and this is the only vitamin that I have found that doesn't cause cramping. Taking Alive along with a Pro-biotic and daily fiber therapy really helps tame that beast."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I bought this tea at the Whole Foods in London and haven't been able to get it at the branch in my city. I did buy another brand of orange-flavored white tea from the WF here, but it had a metallic aftertaste. The Clipper brand is far better, but I set my timer when I steep it - two minutes is perfect. Not too strong and totally refreshing. The tea is totally organic and in unbleached bags. I'm happy to order 6 boxes because I know I like it, but wish Clipper would offer a selection of their flavors in one box. 6 boxes is a lot to order if you just want to try their other offerings."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I had been drinking 3-4 16 oz mugs of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea for a couple years. Six or more months ago I tried the Yogi Egyptian MINT Herbal tea, which is even better. The mint is soothing to the digestive system . It is especially calming to drink at night before bed...But then again it is great in the morning after my usual cup of coffee. Now I give it to friends when they have digestive problems. You can't go wrong if you like licorice and mint..its the best combinationENJOY a mug full"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have used this product many times. The muffins turn out light and fluffy, with a great taste, and no ""bean"" after-taste. The best thing to make with this mix is waffles, following the recipe on the back of the box. They taste great, and they freeze well. The toasted waffles make a great replacement for toast for those on a gluten-free diet."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"My daughter is five months old. Since I went back to work when she was 11 weeks, I have difficulty finding time to pump often enough during my twelve-hour shifts to maintain my milk supply. In addition to that, she night-weaned at two months. So I noticed my milk production was decreasing, but not so much that it was a problem. Then, in the past couple of weeks, the milk production dropped off quite a lot, and then my period returned. (I was hoping it would stay away for at least another month or two)At that point, I was only able to pump 1 oz from each side, nowhere near enough to feed her while I was at work. When I was at home, I felt like all I did was breastfeed. A decrease in milk production is common when menstruation returns, but I had no idea mine would take such a hit! It was awful.I set aside an entire day and did nothing but rest, hydrate, and nurse. I also ordered Mother's Milk tea. I was encouraged by the positive reviews!The tea arrived in two days, and in the meantime I was lucky enough to have a few days off to spent with my baby.It tastes like black licorice. Loss of one star for the flavor. It's not the best, but not horrible either. Certainly worth it!My best advice for making the tea more palatable:1. Brew it strong. I use about 5oz water.2. Sweeten with honey3. Drink it hot.So I had a cup in the morning, and one in the evening... Then when I woke up the following morning I was engorged. I have been drinking it regularly and I see a definite and consistent increase in milk production. I haven't been able to pump this much since I was still on maternity leave!I've actually been engorged a few times since starting the tea, and honestly there is nothing else I can attribute it to. It's too much of a sudden improvement to be anything else. I try to have 2 or 3 cups per day."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,"I love these. They taste great and they give you a quick carb boost. I do a lot of mtn biking here in East TN, and for me these have become mandatory for any ride longer than an hour. There are 6 ""bloks"" in each individual package, and each blok is 8 grams of carbs. I'll pop one every 15 or 20 minutes to keep my energy level up and electrolyte levels high. I have a buddy that has diabetes, and these have come in handy on several occasions when he was low and needed a precise amount of quick delivery carbs. I have also tried the cola flavored ones that have caffeine, and they taste gross. These are premium."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"this product delivers great moist heat. But if you use it often, the wires stop connecting and won't heat the elements. the timer will say error and you will need to keep playing with the wires to get a connection. I found this happened after one year of use, so bought another and a year later,the same thing happened. Great product but beware if you plan to use it a lot, you may need to purchase a new one every year."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"This curry paste is great for putting flavor into something simple. I throw a can of diced tomatoes in the crock pot along with some chopped onion and garlic, a few tablespoons of the paste, a little broth and whatever meat I have on hand. Chicken, beef, lamb, it doesn't matter. I come home to a wonderful aroma and after steaming some rice I have a meal that tastes like I've been working on it all day.It is very mild but flavorful. In fact, a friend who absolutely hates spicey food loved this. I actually like spicey food and sometimes mix one tablespoon of the hot along with two tablespoons of the mild. Just depends on my mood and who I'm cooking for."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"My husband has always picked apart the seasonings I used. They were too heavy, strong or just bland. Once I started using Mrs. Dash Garlic and HerbMrs Dash Garlic & Herb Salt Free Blend, 6.75-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 6), I was suddenly a wonderful cook. I didn't change my cooking methods, just my seasonings. Now my husband can be heard saying ""mmm, this is good"", and going for seconds when he shouldn't. Mrs. Dash, you made my heart happy, and my cooking take a change for a healthy heart cooking."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,5.0,"We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years. Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast. It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good! You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say. I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick! I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world! All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa. You're set, drink up! Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can. It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water. When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting. (Yes, it IS that good!) I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision."
baby products,feeding,unknown,5.0,"I like this product. After researching all the different types of belly supports, this one came up to be the best. It is very comfortable and I feel it is better to have it than have nothing at all. It takes some of the pressure off. Its easy to put on and I love the hook-and-eye feature. It stays clean. For the price, I would reommend this to anyone"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I love these bags! They are easy to pour milk into after I pump and so easy to prepare when I need a bottle. The bags stand up nicely when I'm pouring the milk into them, which is great when I'm combining bottles for a larger volume bag. They work really well with the First Years milk organizer, I have tons of milk nicely organized in my freezer!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Of all the varities of green tea I have had, this is the best. It has an excllent taste to it that is unlike any other--a nice flowery twist that reminds me of tea smells from my childhood. Really good stuff--I can't say enough nice things about it and apparently it's healthy for you too so there you are."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"All I can say is wow. I have used just about every steroid prescription spray, Astelin (anti-histamine nose spray, Afrin, Ocean Spray, a bunch of homeopathic sprays, Neti Pot and none of them have done what this spray has done for my sinus inflammation and slight congestion. I recently got a septoplasty and turbinate reduction done and I have always had this slight pressure, and very uncomfortable feeling in the middle of my nose since the surgery and until I found this spray I have been miserable for the past year. I would not recommend this spray for someone who has severe congestion and a sinus infection, for those unfortunate ones that have that I would recommend using a neti pot 4x a day with sea salt until the symptoms go away and then use the Simply Saline."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,The Greens Plus natural bars are the best I have ever eaten. They are very nutritious and satisfying. I eat one every morning for breakfast. As a result I don't get hungry again till late afternoon even after a ten mile bike ride or a walking game of golf.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Most importantly these particular bars taste great - most flavors are great. (Not a fan of Carrot Cake) For any first timers, the bars aren't the most aesthetically pleasing at first but you get used to it. I like to have them as a breakfast food or as an afternoon snack to get me going. I'm currently not as active as I used to be but I have a pretty healthy appetite and these bars don't fill me up as much as some other people here, but it does the job.These are pretty healthy and mostly organic but when it comes to food it always comes down to taste and these bars pass that test. So everything else is a plus. Additionally there's a ton of flavors out there, so there's one for everyone."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I started taking this daily about a month ago. I haven't notice anything different. Perhaps I'm less sore, but I can't really tell. At least I don't have an upset stomach from it. On a positive note, the power mixes very well with protein shakes."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After a treatment of antibiotics, you need to replenish your colon with a good probiotic. Without going into the dreary details, this product, which is to be followed after first using Threelac, is a wonderful means of retoring the balance to our colon/body. I have been on this product now for two years, and swear by it. Don't hestitate to use it. Super product!Also, I have suggested this to people who have constant diarrehea. It works like a charm. Try it. You might be surprised."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"The MuscleTech Nitro Tech Bars Double Chocolate Supreme bars are great to eat as a Meal Replacement before a workout.

I did contact customer service and the girl said ""sorry, you are past the 90 days so you will need to buy a new one.... Why would I pay more money for a product that just stopped working after a few months.... Are they crazy..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Product was shipped and received promptly. I was a little disappointed in the size of the Softgels--they are pretty big, would have preferred smaller 'pills' but are ok."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This product is delicious. I simply enjoy the taste of the subtle honey that is already infused in the sachet. Being a mom on the go the individual sachets work well. The seller Nature and Herbs are great and professional. They were expedient and were quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely use them again.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"I have tried a few name brand OPKs and while I do think that they are slightly better than these strips, the savings is worth it. My only real complaint with these strips is that the dye on the color bands is very streaky/blotchy, and can make them hard to compare. It's almost like the color band doesn't fill in entirely in certain areas of the line. I don't think it will keep me from seeing a positive though.Oh and the directions say to test when your urine is at room temperature, which I thought was odd and I'm not sure why its necessary but I'm doing it anyway. I just let the cup sit for 15-20 mins then come back and test. Not a big deal for OPKs but it will probably be hard to wait that time when using the pregnancy tests!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"We've tried all the fresh food feeders available and this one is the best so far! Baby cannot unsnap the lid so there's no accidental openings; the bags are slick therefore easier to clean; the round handle is perfect size for baby's grasp. Cute as well, can't miss! We slip a sippy cup holder through the handle and anchor it to baby's stroller, bouncer or highchair, etc, so it doesn't get tossed to the floor or ground!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"The seat is small, easy to fold up and easy to clean. I use it during ECFE classes, in restaurants, and at grandma's house. I like that the height is perfect for him to sit at the table (without the tray) at most restaurants. It's the smallest seat that I could find."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,these are very good! They are actually mini-chocolate chips. The flavor is good; but I know not to eat too much at a time because they are sweetened with malitol and too much can cause gas and act as a laxative. For adding a taste of chocolate to cookies or mixing with regular chocolate chips for reducing sugar intake they are great.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,This is a good replacement for people who want to eliminate coffee from their diet. I like having warm drinks but hot chocolate and other beverages that need to be sweetened do not satisfy me like Pero. I can sweeten it to my taste and it has the full-bodied flavor that doesn't need sweetening. I will recommend it to all my over-caffeinated friends and family.

We use them to keep our family members warm while eating dinner or snuggling on the sofa during winter months without having to crank up the heat (and heating bill.)Pros:* The pad itself is soft, flexible, comfortable.* The heating element does not shift around inside the cover like some other heating pads we've purchased.* Gets plenty warm.* Has an optional timer setting.* Is apparently okay for wet heat and can be unplugged and thrown in the washing machine, although we haven't tried either of those options (yet).Cons:* Buttons don't work perfectly on one of the three pads"

I glanced at the ""supplement facts"" and saw ""800 mg"" and bought this product, faithfully taking 1 tablet a day. This morning I happened to notice that the 800 mg is per serving - which is 4 giant pills a day! Even my ""One a Day"" vitamins have 400 mg in just one vitamin! I am so angry at myself and this riduculous company and scared that I will become pregnant now."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Texas Pete is a milder hot sauce that is served in so many restaurants in the South because it is pleasing to most palates. Its not meant to blow the roof off, but instead to give a nice peppery flavor to your food. It also isnt based on the favored peppers of Texas; the Garner brothers of North Carolina just wanted a name to suggest the spicy southwest flavor. The year was 1929, so chillax. Its worth a taste, regardless of what detractors are saying here. Please try it and decide for yourself. I personally love it and add it to darn near everything!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been taking St. Johns off and on for about several years now. I will tell you straight up that when i stopped taking then everything went down hill for me as far as my depression and other issues. I just started back again in the New Year to get a grip of myself and deal with all my issues. I take this along with L-TYROSINE and i have noticed a huge difference in me. I am much more focused, no anxiety, sleep like a baby, and really able to get alot of things accomplished. So, this is part of my daily process and i do not leave anywhere without. It does take a while to get into your system which is about a month or so but you will see the difference."

health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"Once I got used to the taste, I liked drinking it. So much better to take than those honking pills that are out there! I wasn't taking this vitamin long, and my infant son, who was totally bald, suddenly began to grow hair! It was funny, because since it started growing all at once, it stood straight up and looked as though we had given him a buzz cut. It's fuller and thicker now and finally starting to be combed down. (about 2 months later) My hair had been thinning since having given birth, so I was pleasantly surprised to see mine start to grow too. Love it!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"This is a miracle cream. It completely eliminated my hot flashes after about 2 weeks of regular use.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have been accused of going over-board on some things and my K-Cup obsession has been no different. I have tried almost every bold K-Cup on the market (really, my kitchen is full of those little boxes). Many of them are very good, and some (like Timothy's Rainforest Espresso) are excellent. Still, for day to day drinking I always go back to this blend. I find it to be smooth and satisfying. I use the second to smallest setting on my Keurig B70 (7 1/4 oz.) and I usually enjoy three to four cups in the morning (I never reuse a K-Cup, but if it works for some people, fine). If I want more or a cup later in the day I switch to the decaf version, also very good.I miss my Newman's Own so much when I travel that I have started packing a Keurig B30 with me so I can enjoy this coffee on the road. I now also drink Coffee People's Organic blend, as a matter of fact I have grown to prefer it but that does not take away from how good of a coffee this is.Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]"

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"I have been on this off and on for the past year...I HIGHLY recommend starting small (say, one or two pills each night before bedtime) for a week...build up your stamina, thereafter, ingest at your own pace, but DO NOT exceed 4 or 5 pills a night (excessive diarrhea)...Obviously, it produces diarrhea, and (when taken with a pro-biotic) makes you emit farting sounds (there, I said it) after a day or so of beginning use...After about three or four weeks of constant use, lay off the pills for a week or so...you can tell when to lay off, because the diarrhea that issues becomes more loose with some ""bloody"" bits. Please allow your colon and sphincter muscle to heal...You WILL lose some weight, not grandiose, but it does clean out your system...not sure though, if your body and intestines absorb healthy nutrients with this stuff...as food seems to ""pass through"" your intestines fairly quickly...Like everything, do it in moderation...a little at a time...spend a month or two."

There is a dual pack available that contains an Omega 3 supplement with additional folic acid, so taken together, you get 1000mg of folic acid a day which is perfect for prenatal development. This was the only supplement I found that contained 1000mg of folic acid. The multi is vegan, the supplement is not. The supplement has an orange oil additive to prevent fishy tasting burps or reflux."

Smell that wonderful aroma??!!!Add a little cream or milk or Soy (or, rice milk, etc etc) and a little sugar/honey and kick back and enjoy!!This is BLISS, this is MEDITATION of the highest order, in a teacup.(PS- add this tea, cooled, to your smoothie or milkshake too)"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea is so delicious, complex, and versatile. It is more peppery/spicier than other Chai's I have tried. In fact, this tea is so delicious, it is the only chai tea I will drink! Why bother trying anything else?!When drinking this tea, I make sure the water is extra hot and I add a touch of honey and some milk, which makes tea drinking an exquisite experience. It's absolutely delightful at all times throughout the day.Based upon the energy I personally feel after drinking this tea, it seems to have have more caffeine than the average black tea, such as RedRose.Just as a side note, this tea tastes nothing like the Starbuck's Chai Tea Latte offered at the store. If you are interested in capturing the flavor of a Chai Tea Latte, I would recommend purchasing the Tazo Chai syrup, not the tea bags."

I make four big patties with each box and serve with a rice dish and a salad. Makes a great, quick meal for two people."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,5.0,"A friend of my mother's suggested that my wife apply Emu oil while going through radiation treatment for breast cancer (caught early - treatment now complete - excellent prognosis) which is really damaging to the skin and underlying tissues. After looking at prices and reviews on Amazon, she decided to use Thunder Ridge. She was two weeks into her treatments when she started applying the Emu oil and she felt it really made a difference. Her doctor was impressed by the health of her skin throughout the duration of the radiation treatment. And after the treatment was complete and a few weeks of healing, her skin seems to have little ill effect from the radiation. It's hard to say with certainity that it was the Emu oil, but since then she has continued to use Emu oil as a moisturizer for dry skin and now my 16 year old daughter has her own bottle. It should be noted that the bottles we have received are much prettier solid blue than the one shown in the Amazon picture."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"The elastics are somewhat hard to figure out, complicated to wrap. Also, the ice pack is made out of water, so neither easy to bend around foot nor comfortable as it's literally ice with plastic against the thin inner layer of mesh. Also water pockets easily thaw, so not long lasting icing (about 20 minutes tops) Works decent if 1) let it thaw for 10 minutes so you can bend the wrap 2) memorize the elastics methodology. Need some improvement on product design"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"I purchsed Nana's Coconut Chip cookies at Amazon and loved them. Incredibly moist, luscious and yummy, these oversized cookies are as satisfying as they are good for you. With wholesome ingredients and no refined flour or sugar, these are truely healthy treats. Chocolate chips and coconut flakes are paired perfectly while the flavor of each is allowed to shine through. Brilliant! If you love chocolate and coconut, especially together, in one chewy concoction, you would find these cookies addictive. And they are vegan too."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"A great product! I bought one as a Christmas present for my wife, and she loves it! I spent several weeks looking at reviews for various foot spas. I'm glad I picked this one - it's definitely worth the money. The water heats up quickly and the water jets feel great. As others have mentioned, the attachments are fairly useless. Still, it's a great way to relax and soothe your feet after a long day of standing. You can also add salts, which (surprisingly) some other expensive foot spas don't allow.It does splash a bit - for minimum spillage, I recommend filling it with a pitcher rather than trying to fill it at the sink and carry it, and putting a towel beneath it when it's turned on."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,The organic decaffeinated green tea is difficult to find in my area. Having a six box supplies is comforting and the price is great when you buy in bulk. Once I see how long this lasts I may set it up on the recurring order plan.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"These are by far the best Luna bars. They taste a lot like an Oreo cookie bar and they are super healthy. I recommend these to anyone who wants a healthy, sweet snack."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"No complaints with this product. I had a hard time even telling that it was sugar-free. You have to kind of learn through trial and error how much syrup to use to get the taste to your liking, but once you're dialed in, it's superb. A bit pricey, but I'll probably buy it again some time as a treat. Don't know if its required, but I keep the in the refrigerator after I open it, and didn't notice any degradation in flavor."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"I really like these hot water bottles. They feel very durable. One side has ridges while the other side is smooth depending on how much heat you want. I will start by saying that I abuse the hot water bottles quite a bit. I use them frequently and while I generally do not use straight boiling water, I mix it with some cold tap water, the bottles get pretty hot. The negative I found is that after 3 months of owning one of these bottles it tore. That's right, it didn't burst or get a hole, it literally tore at the seam. I imagine it was while I was laying on it and shifted and combined with the heat of the water it just came apart. Also, some of the plastic coating that is on the smooth side started to peel off. These are expensive bottles and even though I use them a lot I expected a bit more durability. The last hot water bottles I had lasted for over 10 years before they sprung a hole. I decided to give these bottles another shot and ordered 2 more of them because I really do like these bottles. Hopefully it may have just been a fluke or a bit too much abuse. I will update this review if anything happens to the new bottles I received."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"My husband snores like it's his job. I wasn't too optimistic but i had to at least try. As soon as he put it in there was silence. and he stopped tossing and turning as much as well, which results in ME sleeping better. **the heavens are parting and i can hear angels singing**My only pet peeve is that it doesn't always stay in all night. if you toss and turn a lot it may slip out. Just as a warning."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is my favorite brewer's yeast, hands down. Here's why:1. It tastes much better than other ones I've tried.2. The nutritional profile is great, especially for protein and iron. A single serving of 2 tablespoons provides 16g of protein and 30% RDA of iron.3. It dissolves easily and tastes good in most recipes (cookies are a favorite).4. The cost here on Amazon is awesome!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This spice packet is fabulous. It is simple, delicious and only has herbs, spices and salt. There is no beef extract or yeast gulten or other unnecessary stuff. I add a pinch of chipolte pepper spice to give a bit more heat and it makes the perfect taco meat."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,My husband and I bought the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor based on the reviews we read. I couldn't believe there were so many people who said it worked the first month. I have been diagnosed with PCOS. Our first child took us over 2 years to conceive and this was after failed attempts at fertility medicines. We had already been trying to conceive for a second time for about 12 months when we bought the monitor. It worked the first month. I don't know if we were just missing the day every month or what but we were SO thrilled to find out that I am pregnant. For us it was definatly worth the money. Much less expensive than other fertility options and more private.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"As with others, received 2 Side A's instead of mirror image side B. However, laughably, the English as second language instructions call for 2 side A's, which seems to be a cover up on the company's part to avoid having to go through their boxes and actually put the right parts in. The chair can actually be assembled this way, but looks terrible and ill conceived. Wooden plugs don't stay in holes; anyway the half that you can actually plug when assembling the chair as per the directions, which by the way have sloppy and difficult to decipher hand drawn diagrams that look like they were done by a 5 year old. Belt is cheap plastic and wouldn't hold any size or sort of creature with any degree of safety and security. My 9 month old immediately squirmed out of the belt and stood up despite my best efforts at adjustment. Finish is passable but uneven, and unprofessional tooling is evident everywhere. Chair wobbled once assembled, so I turned it over to see if I could locate the cause; this turned out to be a completely missing rubber foot; only three were present. Worse, the three rubber feet that were there were screwed in, and the place where the fourth foot should be did not even have a screw hole to indicate a foot had ever been installed. Apparently counting to 4 is too difficult a feat for the crack squad of furniture technicians at Lipper, who were either drunk, lazy, or lacking in the basic art of giving a damn when they built and packaged this utter waste of your hard earned money.Bought this looking for value; instead, every aspect of this product disappoints severely. Avoid with extreme prejudice."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,5.0,"Sugarfree Red Bull is by far better than its sugar filled brother. With only 10 calories per can, it tastes lighter and crisper than that ""other"" Red Bull. It can't replace the morning coffee, but after a workout, it can make you feel significantly better until you can replenish with food.However, the prices on Amazon are NOT a good deal. The only way it is a good deal is if you simply can't find the product anywhere. You can regularly find a 12 pack at any Wal-Mart or grocery store for $20. If you really need 24, then go buy two 12 packs for just over $40. Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 more? But gas you say? Please, if you spend $10 in gas to get to the store, then by all means buy your Red Bull here. Anyway, to reiterate, great product-horrible Amazon prices."

AMAZING."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,I love Amy's products and the light sodium chili is one of my favorites. I enjoy with shredded cheese or gluten free crackers. The chili is nicely spiced and great on cold days. This chili is vegetarian so can be eaten during Lent. I'm pleased that Amazon carries Amy's products and offers replenishment after so many months. I have served the chili over gluten free pasta. Many of Amy's products are gluten free.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This stuff does not taste amazing. In fact, it tastes like watered down muscle milk, if you've ever had that brand. That being said, it does not have all the artificial sweeteners and strange ingredients muscle milk has. You want to avoid anything artificial. Things like sucralose, aspartame etc. aren't particularly good for the human body. Or, at least, their long-term effects haven't been studied enough to determine.The taste is bearable, and after drinking it for a while, I grew to like the taste. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just bland. Which is better than tasting bad. It is very low in sugar, which is good. It has 24g protein per serving. Whey protein is the best, and this is only $30 after taxes and shipping. Great deal. (I bought the 2lb chocolate kind). I refuse to try the vanilla as I have found that most vanilla protein shakes are disgusting.So in conclusion, this is all natural (which is great), cheap for the amount you get, has a decent taste (not great, but not bad. It's drinkable!), and as long as you're lifting hard, it will aid you in seeing results. I drink mine immediately after lifting, and sometimes before going to bed as your muscles are recuperating and rebuilding while you sleep. Great product!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"This is a wonderful alternative to a fan for white noise!!! I can not sleep without some type of noise and this device has more than met the task! I do not like the prerecorded sound machines, so I have always used a fan to create noise. No longer....I purchased one for each son and my sister! Highly recommend!"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"This is great when you have a headache or back/neck pain. It warms nicely in microwave and is much better than those products that are filled with rice or seeds. It doesn't have an ""odd"" odor like those filled with seeds. Nice weight to product, conforms to the body very nicely. I have given this item to my sister and to my dad and they both love it as well. Highly recommend this item if you are looking for something that is well made and that can be used for hot as well as cold compresses."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,This item does not work! I believe it is just plain vitamins if even that! Has zero affect on bust growth
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I am loving the flavor of this tea! My Mom had some in tea bags that she gave me that I fell in love with. So much so that when I got to the bottom of the box, I horded the last tea bag because I didn't want to use it all up. After doing a search for this tea on the net, I was super pleased to find that Amazon carried it because my local grocery stores (and I checked all of them) didn't. I took a leap and got the big bag of loose tea and haven't been disappointed. I even got my husband and my Mother-in-law hooked on it. We got her a big bag for her birthday. Having spent time in Russia, both she and my hubby said this tea reminded them of the wonderful tea that they had there and hadn't been able to find anywhere in the US. This full bodied, rich black tea is good plain, sweetened, with cream, lemon or iced. I will never use lipton tea again for my Summer iced tea. There is no comparison. And I WILL be reordering. If this is what the English drink for tea time, I can see why they have to have it every day. Order it loose or in bags, you will not be disappointed."

The product is well designed, sturdy, lightweight, compact, and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this item to family and friends. Well worth the higher price."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This supplement arrived in a timely manner and seems to be working fine for me. Have used for about 30 days and have not noticed any dramatic difference in my energy level but I will continue to use this in hopes that it is doing some good in the long run.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"Not as good as the occipital pivot, which actually works better for the upper cervical vertabrae release I'm looking for as I've had neck pain forever. For me, the ""fingers"" on this one are too low and don't reach the correct places for neck muscles to release."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm a bit sceptic about supplements, I suppose sometimes the placebo effect is stronger than the real one.But nevertheless, I use CoQ10, Gingko Biloba and DHEA from Swanson, and I could tell that I feel more energized and mentally strong. I don't care if it's the placebo effect or anything else, as long as I pay such low prices for these things.I would recommend you to take this combination if you work with your brain - it could help you be more productive.If you are into supplements a lot, I recommend a good book that will tell you why you should take a handful of supplements 3 times a day to keep you brain and body healthy for longer:Brain Longevity"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,cocktail mixers,5.0,I was a bit skeptical when I first ran across Baja Bob's sugar free margarita mix. I decided to take the plunge based on the positive reviews and the desire to cut back on the sugar and calories in my drinks. I am extremely pleased to say the least. I followed the directions of 3 parts mix to 1 part tequila but this was a bit too weak for my liking. I changed it to 2:1 and was in heaven. I couldn't even tell the difference between this and my sugar filled Jose Cuervo mix. I will be buying again. Highly recommended.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,1.0,"This was dissapointing. So much so that I wouldnt waste another second on talking about it except to say Im tossing the product because it was lacked any taste whatsoever and I wouldnt want to inflict the nothing on another being. Stick with Water, at least it has some flavor."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I seriously don't understand why anyone thinks this is a small portion size. I am a 15 year old girl, and find there to be MORE than enough crackers whenever i eat this. It's extremely filling, which is nice when you're hungry. We would always get them on our bus ride home after a day trip at my camp. The bus is filled with kids from grades 3-10, and everyone is more than satisfied.A GREAT tasting snack! I recommend it for anyone who like goldfish but wants something MUCH better."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"A friend recommended this product to me. I was beginning to have hot flashes and mood swings (fun)! I was skeptical, but ordered it and took it as directed. I didn't really notice a huge difference when I was taking it, BUT when I ran out I didn't reorder right away. Guess what came back? Mood swings, hot flashes, sweats. So I am convinced that Estrotone works for me! I would recommend it!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"You will hate it if you spread it on toast like you would peanut butter or jam. A little packs a big punch. 1/2 tsp is sufficient.I spread it on toast add cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce (sometimes a boiled egg) and bacon. It gives blt's a kick and the cheddar enhances the flavor.TRY IT."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,4.0,"This is a great case, durable and well made - much more so then any others I have used in the past. It has a lot of room and many pockets to allow you to set up what you need to carry in an organized way. I have no issue with zippering the cool side even when loaded with pens and vials and both ice packs.My one disappointment is that it is advertised with a detachable container for used sharps and supplies to hold them until you can move them to an appropriate permanent container, however the case came with 'snaps' where this container must attach but no container as it is showing the in the images and mentioned in what comes with the case. One of the several things I was looking for in a case was a special container like this so I did not have to devote a pocket to playing the role or carrying a separate container. I have looked and there does not seem to be anywhere this container is sold separately so I am bit bemused by why it was not included in the original packaging. The case came sealed in its packaging so I don't think it was originally there and just strayed.Update"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Although they do not taste as good as Cliff Bars, considering the amount of Protein in it, it tastes pretty good. The Chocolate Chip Cookie dough is very good. I am not able to make the Met RX drinks, so the bars come in handy."

I was shocked to read the label of cornstarch and see how it is loaded with carbs. This arrowroot powder works just fine in all of my recipes; it is smooth and silky and much lower in carbs. Being vegetarian, it is also handy for thickening all kinds of sauces and tofu-based recipes."
health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,"I was on an estrogen patch for eight years, and was always worried about the side effects, so I decided to try Promensil. So far it has worked pretty well for me. The only con would be that it does not really help vaginal dryness. It is also cheaper than the patch even with insurance coverage."

My cubicle 'neighbors' would see me massaging trigger points on my shoulders and back and would ask what it was like. Several asked to use it and we now pass it back and forth over the cube wall. We pretty much appropriated the TheraCane for our department. A couple of us even got one for ourselves to use at home."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Purchased this because it was cheaper than the small jars in the supermarket.The bottle is HUGE!!!! So much so that I have given baggies of these herbs to several friends and still have plenty left for myself.If I were to try to keep it and use it all myself, it would go stale before I had used 1/4 of this container.Great quality, very fragrant and fresh."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I purchased this tea after I was given a box of Madagascar Red Tea,(a different brand altogether) it was good, but... I wanted to find out more about Rooibos tea and all of the health benefits of Red Tea. I started reading more on the subject and I searched online and then ordered the Freshpak brand. The delivery was quick (only a few days). Well to say the least, I am totally hooked!!! I found myself drinking this tea all day long - throughout the winter months. The only down side is I've search alot of health food and speciality stores and could'nt find it :-(I will continue to order this product - there are not too many true (Red -Rooibos Teas) however, this one is!!!"
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,5.0,"Well, despite being highly dubious, I bought and drank this milk. I didnt actually think it would cure my chronic rectal bleeding, or even taste any different from regular milk for that matter. Oh how wrong I was!Not only is my anus and rectum as fresh and new as the day I was born, but it tasted very much as I remember the sublime ambrosia from my mothers breasts tasting like. I recall that flavor well, since my mother breast-fed me well into my teens. Interestingly, she was my adopted mother, but her work as a wet-nurse meant there was plenty of her love amber to go around. Even my father started breast-feeding again. But we digress.This milk is truly miraculous, and I seldom use that word. Mainly because it's ugly and sounds like vacuous, a word my father uses for my biological mother Bertha Ann.So buy and consume this overwhelmingly mouth-watering, magnificent, majestic, and miraculous milk....even if you dont have rectal bleeding."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,"It is almost impossible to find these bars in stores anywhere, so it is a relief to get them thru Amazon. I will continue to purchase them this way instead of trying to find them elsewhere."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Now that Balance Bar has stopped making the chocolate fudge low carb bars, this has become my favorite low carb bar. It is similar in taste to a Milky Way, but the reduction in carbs means it is not nearly as tasty. But in the low carb world it is much better tasting than other bars I have had. It does not have a saw dust kind of flavor that many bars have. I tend to have one of these about every other day as a snack, and it keeps my sweet tooth in check."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,"Thees crackers are the best, they taste great and are healthy too. My only issue is with the price; although this a good price on this product, Target sells them every day for lower. Target usually sells them for $2.39 a box (times 12 would be 28.68), and often they go on sell for $2.00 a box. One time I even saw them for as low as $1.90 a box! I love these crackers, and I highly recommend them; I just can't see the point in ordering them from amazon when I can get them at my local Target for less."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I have no idea as to it causing any weight loss but I enjoy the flavor and try to have a cup every day during the winter. Was very surprised that I could find it on line and that it is a little cheaper this way than calling a dealer. It arrived in good time and had no problem with this order.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Though I prefer her hotter sauces, I think that this sauce is a five-star sauce as far as ""mild"" ones go. Marie's medley of vegetables and other flavors, with a prominent carrot note (hence much of the orange color), make this a sauce that is memorable for its flavor and not simply its mild heat. Though I have used it on all sorts of foods, I find that it works best on things like rice and beans, or a mild soup with lentils and potatoes, since a less-flavorful food lets the flavors of the hot sauce stand out better than do more extravagantly flavored foods, in which I find the taste of the sauce tends to get a little lost."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been using licorice chew sticks for years. They are partly the reason why my teeth stay so white and clean all of the time, even soothes my stomach(licorice is great for upset stomachs) and also helps relieve headaches when you bite on them I find.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"Reading reviews of other heating pads, there were some complaints about the heating pad not being hot enough. That's not the case with this one. In fact, it's hotter than I would like so I have to use a towel with it. Also I do not wrap it completely around my neck. It does have a timer, but I turn it off early because the heat is so intense. If you lie back in your recliner with it on, the heat will be even more intense. I would have given this 5 stars if there was a temp regulator on it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"The vitamin shoppe is not responding to my notices - As of today, we are 10 days past our latest shipment arrival date, yet we have never received our product, and have send two appeals for them to PLEASE RESEARCH And RESPOND to us. I have never had problems with an Amazon vendor like this before. Needless to say I am NOT happy!!! This is a great product, it really keeps lungs clear and helps alot with springtime allergies and congestion.Looks like I will be ordering it thru someone OTHER THAN the Vitamin Shoppe if I want to breathe this spring."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This didn't do much for me and thats probably because I used it after doing the spittle test and thinking that I ""mighta-coulda-maybe"" have candida. I took it for over a month and it didn't do anything...which makes sense because I'm pretty sure that I don't have candida now. So, before you spend this amount of money, get properly diagnosed. It does get frustrating trying to figure out whats wrong with yourself sometimes, but you don't want to just throw money away. I gave it three stars because I'm sure Threelac does something for people who need it, but just not for me, so I can't quite accurately rate it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"I used Puralin, quite few years ago but could not find it at our local pharmacy. Thank goodness, I found it at Amazon and it's helping me, again! It's medically safe even if you have some health problems."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"This pump has a dial that is supposed to be able to increase or decrease the amount of suction applied but there is no difference between the lowest and highest settings. After a few uses it becomes noisy, and by that I mean it clicks and squeeks. And this sound is coming from who knows where since the handle assembly itself is not easily taken apart without breaking it. It was extremely difficult to extract much, if any milk with this flimsy pump since most of my time was spent putting the thing back together. I do not recommend the purchase or attempted use of this product. It may be priced attractively but it is not worth the frustration."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was really skeptical at first. A lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size. After the first day, my breasts started to feel heavier, fuller, and more firm. I started at an A-cup and even with inconsistent use (maybe 2 capsules a day or less), I was reaching toward a C-cup at the end of a couple months or so. I would highly recommend this product, cause it also helps with constipation too. I stopped taking it orally because I noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts. So at the moment I'm gonna try making a rub out of it so I can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage."

If you are serious about losing some stubborn fat, and you aren't afraid to train hard, MX-LS7 will be a great supplement for you!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I love Green Magma. And I don't mind the taste. This was a good deal and I received the item very quickly.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I weight train 5 days a week and am in pretty good shape. I'm not sure how people can tell the difference in performance from one protein to the next. I assume most of it is in their head or they are comparing to really cheap protein? Anyways, saying that, I am happy with the ""performance"" of this product :)But really in protein drinks I go by content and taste. This does have more calories than others I use and slightly more fat, but I could argue that is not all bad depending on your workouts and other eating habits.Probably the most important to me though is TASTE. And this is delicious! Whether you put it in water or skim milk. I put it in skim milk for breakfast so it's a little more filling and few more calories. Post workout in water is almost just as tasty.

When stores in my area stopped stocking it, I drove to other areas to fetch some cans. Yummy pork, chicken and vegetable casseroles are especially tasty from using it.

If the miracle middle was supposed to expand or something, it didn't. I'm not a plus-sized person, but I DID just have a baby for crying out loud.Third, they say all covers fit all boppies, but the spare cover I bought didn't fit. It was way too big.Bottom line"

It is so much better than the sleep masks I have tried in the past! It keeps out all light, even when I lie on my side. I like the velcro strap, too, because I do not have the smallest head, so most elastic straps get stretched out very quickly. It's very comfortable; thank you to everyone who wrote reviews!

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon."

I have also not seen any side effects. So last night I had a VERY high-fat meal and would not normally risk taking one of these pills with a meal with such high fat. But I ""tested"" it and NOTHING happened. Therefore, I'm going to assume that the pill either is fake (a placebo) or is only half-filled. I opened one and it was NOT filled to the top. So I've basically wasted time and money on this product and it's too late to return it. I don't think it's ""Alli"" itself but just the batch that I bought."

Finally when I spoke to our pediatrician, she chuckled ""Of course he won't take Enfamil or Similac. They all taste like cardboard compared to breastmilk."" and then she recommended Good Start.I had never heard of it before but based on her recommendation, I tried it. Maybe my baby just gave up at that point, but for whatever reason, he started drinking it from the first try.The only downside is that it is more difficult to find in stores compared to Enfamil or Similac. Of course you can always order online but when you're in a tight spot (like when you're counting down the number of remaining cans while you're waiting for your latest order to arrive), it can be a little nerve racking..."

On a positive side, it's of good consistency and arrived tasting very fresh. But usually I just can't eat enough granola, and with this product I feel like I'm taking medicine - it's not tasty.I'm mixing this in with cereal... perhaps this granola would be better suited for baking.

health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"I always have dry lips and am a lip balm junkie as a result. Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn't matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective. My lips would flake and feel sore, uncomfortable, and dry, and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely. It was so annoying and distracting. No matter what I would be doing (working, cooking, reading etc) I would be constantly distracted by the discomfort of my chapped lips.The problem cropped up recently, and I tried everything this time -- Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar. None of these things worked. Dryness and discomfort would return in short order.So I googled for remedies and kept seeing recommendations for Aquapfor. I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing. Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable. I kept applying periodically, and by the next morning my lips were almost all healed. In about 24 hours my lips were essentially healed. This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.Petrolatum is 41% of the ingredients, but NO, this is not at all like Vaseline even though it may look and feel like it. I had tried both Vaseline and creamy Vaseline for my severely chapped lips, and neither made a difference. Aquaphor did. So don't believe the reviewers who say it is the same. The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).I also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well. It's too greasy to use in the daytime though.I am now a big lifetime fan of this ointment/cream. It's amazing."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I was amazed at how good it tasted and how well it blends. It says to blend 1-2 scoops (the scoop is big, probably a quarter cup at least) into 4-8 oz of water, but I always used at least 12 oz. Even still it tasted great and dissolved entirely. I also tried blending into milk and while it dissolved, I would almost say it tasted better with water.As for the effectiveness, I can't really say if it boosted my muscle growth, but I did think I felt better during my workouts if I drank some beforehand. It is also very filling and made a good breakfast substitute.My only complaint is that I thought it made the back of my mouth sore and caused some major congestion. This happened after drinking it ~2 times a day for about a week. I don't know if this was actually the cause, but the ""sickness"" seemed different than the average cold, and my mucus had a strangely yellow tint, so I thought I might have had an allergic reaction of some sort."

Formerly an avid runner (prior to back injury), I can attest that power bars are about the only thing you can eat during a long-distance run that will not reduce your performance. In fact, power bars were designed to boost your enery with just the right amount of vitamins. You can also eat a power bar as a meal replacement. All other brands are wanna-be copies & do not live up to Power Bar's reputation."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I am actually a recent massage therapy graduate currently studying for licensure. But I purchased the table in order to do my required out-of-class sessions while in school and plan to use afterwards for my own clientele. Previously, I had borrowed an Oakworks Nova from one of my friends, and compared to that, I actually prefer this one. The Master was definitely lighter and less bulkier to transport (My place has stairs I need to transport the table up and down). And so far, it's much easier to set up. Even the folks I treated on both tables actually told me they preferred the Master. My only issue would be that the face cradle is still kind of stiff when trying to adjust it for my clients, but I think with more use, it will get a bit more loose. Also, CDs are not that good (kind of picky, I know). All in all, though, I think it was a great buy for the price (With included accessories and all, you can't go wrong)!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"My 6 year old daughter had a plantar wart and a few smaller warts surrounding it on her foot. We did not want to go the freezing route at the Dr. since I had heard it was painful and might need to be repeated. So we tried the compound w liquid, which removed some of the skin but did not seem to go deep enough since the warts came back immediately. Then we tried the freeze-away which did not do anything at all (I think I was too scared of doing permanent damage so I did not freeze for long enough??) Finally we decided to try duct tape. We had some success, but it was really hard to keep the duct tape on her foot with her high activity level.Finally we bought these mediplast pads about 3 weeks ago. She liked them because they were soft (unlike the duct tape) I would cut the pad really small to fit just over her warts (they will eat any other skin that they touch so be careful to cut it to fit!) We still had some trouble getting the pads to stay on her foot, but we usually ended up changing it 2 times per day. We started out wrapping her foot with athletic tape to get it to stay on, but towards the end we used the large flexible fabric Band Aids to cover it and that worked very well. She pretty much had the mediplast pad on her warts every day for about 3 weeks. We would pull off the loose skin or rub it off with a washcloth in the tub every few days. Happily after 3 weeks, the warts are completely gone! This is a great product!"

health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"I purchased Breath-ease Nasal Moisturizer Gel several years ago, sight unseen. I tried it and liked it. But after reading an article about toxic ingredients in personal care products, I read the label and found it contained Methylparaben and Propylparaben, preservatives that have been linked to cancer.Because parabens generally make up less than 1 percent of total product formulations, they are considered safe by many manufacturers and ingredient-specialists. However, a study conducted at England's University of Reading found that parabens can enter the body through the skin. The study, published in the January 2004 Journal of Applied Toxicology found that 18 of 20 breast tumors contained significant concentrations of parabens!Being a cancer survivor, I no longer buy products containing Parabens. Fortunately, an increasing number of natural personal care companies are using alternative preservatives such as potassium sorbate, grapefruit seed extract, etc. As I said, I bought this product some years back. Hopefully Grossan will reformulate the product to eliminate Parabens.For nasal dryness, I recommend Ponaris Nasal Emollient. It is a clear, light liquid, which contains oils of pine, eucalyptus, peppermint, cajeput, cottonseed oil and iodine. I know it sounds pungent but it is really quite mild and soothing. I apply it with a Q-Tip for instant nasal comfort. Ponaris contains no parabens. Nor mineral oil or petroleum either. The oils in Ponaris are assimilable (petroleum products are not--and in rare cases have caused respiratory (lung) disease due to inhaling traces of Vaseline put in the nose)."
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,4.0,"Commit Lozenges are very addictive. As long as you understand that and deal with it maturely, they can really get the job done of quitting smoking. I am celebrating my one-year anniversary of sucking on my last lozenge by writing this review. Yes, it can be done! However, it took me three YEARS to quit the lozenges.The lozenges are much, much, much more effective than the gum or patches. There is really no comparison. In the first week or two, the lozenges kill about 80 % of the urge to smoke, and then after a few weeks, 100 %. It gets to a point where you'd much prefer the lozenge to a cigarette, because the lozenges have most or possibly all of the satisfaction of smoking a cigarette, with none of the outward side-effects such as smell, social stigma, etc. In fact, once you have a big pile of lozenges laying around, there is no real reason or desire to smoke cigarettes. They provide a nice, even, satisfying nicotine feed that is far superior to the extreme ups and downs of smoking a cig and then not getting to smoke another one for a while.And therein lies the challenge, because the lozenges are so satisfying to the nicotine craving that they are very addicting. They are as addicting as cigarettes, in the same sense that you want one as soon as you finish the last one. I found myself taking a break from lozenges by having an occasional cigarette. That's how twisted it gets - you end up smoking to try to break the habit of taking the lozenges. Think of the lozenges as extremely expensive cigarettes that will just give you mouth cancer instead of lung cancer.At some point, of course, you just have to make the decision to get it over with once and for all, and STOP. It will be hard. It's probably easier to do it with the lozenges than cigarettes, but it's not a cakewalk. You have to want it. Really want it. Standing in your way is the fact that it is a lot easier to pop another lozenge than to change your life. But the upside of lozenges is, I think, that while it takes months for your brain to adjust to life without cigarettes, I think the brain can kick the lozenge habit in 3-4 days, with another 4-8 weeks of general nicotine longing that is not quite as intense but is still uncomfortable and challenging. Be prepared for a a couple of uncomfortable, challenging months. It is insanely difficult to not have anything in your mouth, after however many years you were used to having cigarettes and then the lozenges. I highly recommend Altoid mints to transition from the lozenges to, eventually, nothing. Altoids are so strong they almost burn your mouth, thus masking the weird longing for nicotine that you feel in your mouth for a few months. Nothing else has that strength to fully mask the nicotine craving."

Apple cider vinegar in water and chamomile tea relieved the symptoms, but I wanted a cure. I absolutely did not want to have surgery. I'm about half way through the bottle and am seeing very good results. I started with the one pill once a day and gradually worked up to two pills twice a day. I've also been adding liver friendly foods to my meals. You really can't go wrong adding more raw fruits and vegetables to your diet. Plus, the liver friendly foods are great. Avocado, olive oil, pears, garlic, and sunflower seeds are not hard to eat at all. Add a little honey and vinegar, maybe even a little tahini and you have a great salad. The bloating and discomfort are greatly reduced. My sinus trouble seems to be improving. My allergies even seem to be less annoying. I will definitely be reordering."

The price per pack may seem expensive compared to gels but each pack is equivalent (in calories) to 2 packs of Gu. Also, the small blocks made it so I ate something small every 20 minutes instead of a gel every 50 minutes.

In 3 days it cleared up my UTI gently with no side effects. I plan to use it preventatively and hope to never get a UTI again. It really works!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Although I'm a fan of Motherlove products I was a bit skeptical that this would even work, but it really did! I became pregnant when my other daughter was 9 months and my milk supply dropped to less than 25% of what it was pre-pregnancy (I pump exclusively so I could really see the effects of the pregnancy). The More Milk Two brought my milk production back up to about 75% of what I was pumping pre-pregnancy. It tastes horrible and I found that I have to be strict about taking it on a regular schedule without drinking excess fluids around the time I take it, but it's worth it because it actually works. I had tried alfalfa supplements and raspberry leaf tea on their own and in combination, but they didn't really help. I guess I needed the concentrated version that is in the More Milk Two."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have tried-out this fine tea in several ways now. It was great each way -- hot or icy by itself -- or hot or icy added to regular black tea. My primary purpose was to find a good cherry tea to make my own black cherry black tea blend. This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea. It is not as tart as a ""zinger"" type tea -- rather just spot-on to back the black cherry blend. Celestial Seasonings has fine-tuned this blend of various organic ingredients very well -- to find a mix which is most like a rich tart black cherry tea -- great on its own or in a further mix +++"

I was overjoyed at my baby shower when I received the pillow as a gift. When I opened it up, I was super bummed out when the room instantly filled with a nasty chemical smell from the flame retardant. Unless you plan to chain smoke while simultaneously breast feeding your child, these chemicals seem somewhat overkill. It does not say anywhere in the description of the item that flame retardant is present, but it most definitely taints this otherwise handy product. Two very enthusiastic thumbs down!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"By looking for an affordable substitute to the big coffee chains, I found this. It's excellent and more healthy because it is not full of sugar like other powders. At first I kept making it WAAAAY too strong because I've tried many other types of powder that required 2-3 tbsp per cup. This powder is pure green tea and a little goes a long way. Because a little goes a long way, it is definitely worth paying a little more $$ for this product...the other ones might be cheaper but you need a lot more in your cup to make a good quality green tea latte."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I love this bar. The taste is great not excessively sweet that leaves a sickening after taste. The product is moist and chewy with healthy ingredients. The Blueberry flavor is quite ""real"" and not the artificial kind so prevalent in other products. I love this bar and will get it again - depending upon the price."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"I received this as part of the Amazon Vine and only got one bar to try. So I cannot say if the flavor is consistent between bars and I cannot judge if all are supposed to taste like this.As advertised, this is an Organic & Raw product. So if you have never had raw cashews, cherries or dates, you may not get the flavor you expect, especially with the cashews. Most people are used to them salted and roasted. In this bar, the dates and walnuts were the dominate flavor, not the cherries or the cashews. It tasted more like a raisin walnut bar, than a cherry cashew bar.The bar is a little small compared to most snack bars, about an inch and a half by three inches and the package is a little deceptive in that is larger than the bar by over an inch.Overall, I can't give it a high rating since the Cherry and Cashew flavor is dominated by the Date and Walnut. And as I said, I only have one bar to try, so I don't know if others are better, but for the price I would expect the flavor listed to be correct and the bars to be a bit bigger."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"Each bar is quite heavy and dense, packed with what tastes like a pure mix of dates and nuts interspersed therein. There is a very slight cherry flavor that primarily manifests itself as a sour after-taste. The bar has absolutely NO ""refined sugars, gluten, dairy or soy, cholesterol, transfats, preservatives, GMOs, or artificial anything elses"". Appearance wise, it looks like a 1 cm thick brownie with a sprinkling of nuts. It has a higher calorie and fat count than I was expecting for an organic snack bar.Here are the primary nutrition facts for one bar (other quantities of constituents are negligible);Calories"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar is a tasty snack that much healthier for you than a vending machine candy bar. Just keep in mind that this is organic, but *not* a diet food.The first ingredient is dates, and in fact the overall flavor is that of dates, with a subtle hint of cherries, and nuts. There is also a bit of ""sawdust"" consistency to the bar, not sure if this is from the ground nuts or the organic rice protein. I enjoyed the flavor of this bar; the dates and cherries make a fine combination.It's not sweet compared to a candy bar, but there is enough natural sugar in it from the dates, cherries, and agave nectar to total 17 grams of sugar in a bar. There is also 8 grams of fat from the ground cashews, walnuts, and almonds. Though certainly healthier than standard candy bars, these still have to be considered a fairly high calorie ""treat"" and not a diet food.In all, I really did like the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar; I received a free sample for the purposes of this review, but would happily buy a box of these in the future."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I'll admit I'm not generally a healthy eater and don't have too many organic fruit bars, so I'm not sure what to compare this with. However, I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like a soft granola bar - you can taste the grains, without the crunch. However, for me at least, the cherry flavor wasn't very strong. I love anything cherry (I drink cherry-flavored seltzer regularly), and thought this bar had more of a strawberry-cashew flavor. Still tasty nonetheless."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"This was a pretty good mid-afternoon snack! Cherry flavor can be intense, but here it was well-balanced with the cashews and rice protein blend. I gobbled this down without looking at the ingredients, and it didn't stand out as being obviously organic in any way. Then I looked at the wrapping and saw that it's gluten-free, refined sugar-free, and preservative-free. So if you like granola bars but want something that's natural, this would fit the bill nicely."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I love nuts, and having lots of them jammed into a snack bar is a nice thing. This item is exactly that.Since it's a mix, do not expect to taste each nut separately, but it tastes well. My only complaint is that the dates (as in fruit) in it are a little bit dominant in the taste, making it slightly more sweet than I expected. Yet this is natural sugar, and can be balanced easily with a cup of water."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"I've had a variety of fruit bars over the years and this is definitely one of the worst. It doesn't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it's over burdened with cashews and walnuts (neither of which I like). The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it's not got gluten, doesn't use GMO's, has no cholesterol, no trans-fats, and that the blueberries used therein are raw. Because, you know, mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product, there's not really anything worthwhile here, and lord help you if you have a nut allergy. This thing just didn't taste good and I can't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more. Put it this way"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I'm always looking for tasty, easy-to-eat snacks like granola bars and the like. Something you can hold in one hand and consume in a few bites so you can resume your normal activities recharged and ready.This Pure Blueberry Fruit and Nut Bar boasts some significant virtues in terms of its natural and organic content, but I think its price and flavor will deter me from switching from the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut Granola Bars I rely on now.Yes, those Nature Valley Bars are chock full of corn syrup, but they taste great, they're very filling -- and with the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, I can get them delivered to my door for about fifty cents a bar.In comparison, these Pure Bars are running around $2 apiece -- that's quite a cost difference.As to their flavor, I would grade them a C+ or B-. Not bad... no unfortunate after-taste... but nothing that will get your mouth watering either.Still, if you're someone who eats nothing but organic food -- and you can afford the privilege -- by all means try these. If you like whole grain bars, you may like the taste more than I did."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"This bar is obviously marketed and created for those looking for a ""pure"" bar with nothing extra added. While the concept is there, the lack of a good taste certainly isn't. It isn't horrendous by any means, but certainly isn't the best tasting bar I've ever eaten. That being said, it is healthy, and is nice to be able to have an alternative like this finally come to market. I think the majority of the major food businesses (i.e. Kelloggs, General Meals) aren't going to the level this product does. If you're the type of person looking for something healthy, but doesn't take the best, then this is perfect for you. For those out there, like me, that care more about the taste, you're probably better off looking elsewhere."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"When I opened the package I was a bit skeptical. The bar is rather small looking, and frankly not too visually appealing. The flavor however, is absolutely outstanding. The bar is dense and flavorful, packed with all kinds of nuts and fruits with the dominant flavors being cashews and tart cherries. I was pleased that the bar is not overly sweet, rather focusing on the nuts and the natural sugars from the fruit. The bar is actually quite filling too, and can easily act as a healthy snack that could replace a light lunch or breakfast. I will definitely be ordering more and trying the other flavors. It's like a bag of trail mix packed into a snack bar. Highly recommended!"
health personal care,health care,allergy,2.0,"Ordered one of these 4/10/10 and just (accidentally) destroyed it this morning.My complaints about this unit:1. You MUST push in a little recessed set button 4x after replacing the batteries. This is for date setting, used only for date-stamping the data storage, which you may or may not care about.2. The unit is awkward to use. This is because it is rounded and slippery, so that you have to wrap your hand around to use it without risk of dropping while violently exhaling (the gist of the test). The power button is centered on top and is large and flush with the surface, so if you tighten your grasp during exhaling, you will power the unit off. I consider this a bad mechanical design.3. FEV1 for a test stays displayed for about a second after the double beep indicating test end, and then you can never see it again. Only PEF (which I don't really care about) stays displayed. Apparently nobody else cares about FEV1 (but then why measure it?)4.If I wheeze during exhale (I'm asthmatic!), it usually aborts the measurement in less than a second. This happens to me every 5th or 6th test. Then the PEF is reasonable but the FEV1 is meaningless. It sometimes will repeat the error until I let the unit sit unused for a couple minutes.5. The unit is rounded on all external surfaces except the snout (no edges or corners) and is made of slippery plastic, w/ no rubber grips. It is designed to slide if placed on a hard tilted surface. This morning I picked up my training log (spiral-bound w/plastic cover)with the unit sitting on top of it. As I began walking it slid off the notebook and hit the floor, expelling the batteries. After replacing the batteries and finding a toothpick to ""set"" the date/time, the unit beeped ready but refused to measure - it is now dead. While I don't expect a delicate mechanical meter to survive such a crash, I DO expect instruments intended for home (rather than clinical) use to be designed in such a way as to avoid rather than facilitate such mishaps.It's too bad this unit does not have a better mechanical design. It appears to have been designed for an ""ergonomic"" look, but is in fact just the opposite."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I love the blueberry cliff bars. Soft chewy and deeelicious..:) Just hard to find so I bought them off the internet..:)
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I tried both the blueberry and the cherry versions. Although I really like Blueberry and the health benefits of the blueberry are unsurpassed, I have to say I liked the cherry cashew bar better.This is an extremely nice and convenient little bar. The taste of the cherry is wonderfully good-reminiscent of the intensely flavorful Montmorency Cherries with a superior texture and quality.The cashew of the bar adds a nice balance to the cherry. The nuttiness lends a nice chewiness to the bar, keeping it from an overly soggy texture.These bars are a very enjoyable treat. It's nice to have something like this at your desk-keep your hands clean, while keeping those hunger pangs away!The ingredients list is also very good. The emphasis on organic ingredients insure that this food is chemical and pesticide -free."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"When I look at the bar it seems normal sized, but when I open it and see how large it really is, it seems slightly smaller than other bars. I take a bite and the first thing I notice is the nutty flavor, with a hint of blueberry aftertaste. The bar itself is soft and ever so slightly sticky, but not sticky enough to be messy. This bar is very densely packed material. Not crumbly or flakey.I appreciate the fact that this is all organic and very healthy and that nothing is cooked and processed. But I wonder how they deal with e-coli and the like. E-Coli is found on plants and in animals. The bar clearly states that it isn't processed or cooked. I know there have been E-Coli scares with raw juices and spinach and other produce so I do wonder how they try and prevent it in their product.The flavor has a weird sweetness to it. Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food! I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies. When I bake I tend to pile on the sugar or honey in some cases for sweetness, so that is the flavor I am accustomed to.So for me this bar is not a good match, if I were to buy a fruit bar (which I don't do often) I'd probably stick to good ol' Nutragrain which has a flavor somehow more familiar. But I think for someone is are ultra careful about what they ingest or for someone who only eats raw food this would be an ideal choice. Actually, if I were part of the raw food movement, I'd tout this bar as a fast convenient snack."

So I was really kidding myself when I broke off a small piece of this bar just to taste it...thinking I'd finish it later. NOT. In addition to tasting great, nothing in this bar has been cooked, and all ingredients are organic. It's also gluten free and preservative free.I had planned to eat this bar with a cup of tea for lunch or a snack, but it ended up being dessert. It's nice to have something taste this good without having to feel guilty about eating it."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"I know it's probably my fault for focusing on the ""blueberry"" vs. the ""nut"" on the label of the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Fruit & Nut bar, but it definitely didn't meet my expectations. The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts. They're the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews, but tastewise they take over. I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed. At 190 calories for the bar, they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw. I wish I liked the flavor better."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I've tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I've swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more ""organic"" it is, the worse it's going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn't possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I've tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don't have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there's no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable! I'll be buying more of these for sure."

Their scents were very pleasing, however, what good is a diffused scent if it's limited range is only two feet? I have used Essenza scent diffusers, and they really work well. They will fill an entire room with a fragrance or scent, whereas Candle Bay reed diffusers which I tried do NOT fill a room with fragrance. I do not recommend this product. I suppose the expression, ""You get what you pay for"" is quite true in the matter of reed scent diffusers.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is the sweetest, as opposed to acidic, olive oil produced commercially in Italy. You may be able to find a more precious olive oil (you know the type, comes in a perfume bottle with a price to match) but you won't find a better ""finishing oil"" Used mainly to swirl over a dish of Italian food as a gift to the food, it is not primarily a cooking oil (though you could use it as such). Produced by the Ligurian taggiasca olive which grows near the sea along the coast of the Italian Riviera. To a significant degree olive oil is a product of the climate. Greek olives are darker and more acidic and have a stronger ""olive"" taste, as are sicilian olive oils. Olives are less acidic the milder the climate. French Provenal olives are the sweetest but prohibitively expensive. Choosing olive oil is a tricky business. For instance, Italy sells ore olive oil than it produces. Figure it out. Everything from Spanish olive oil to peanut oils to other stranger Middle Eastern pollutants masquerade as ""pure Italian olive oil."" (Spain, by the way, is the biggest producer of olive oil in Europe and they make some superb extra virgins). But to my taste, this black labeled ROI is the best.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I guess I didn't notice when I actually purchased this that the last line of the product description says, ""BAMBOO BACK SCRATCHER SIZE AND STYLES MAY VARY."" Even if I did read this (which I may have and just glanced not considered because had kids talking to me while ordering) I wouldn't have expected what showed up. I bought 1 for me and 2 for a friend.The back scratcher is over 2 ft long and is really just enormous for a back scratcher. The wheels really aren't that functional and don't do much for you. You really can't get any leverage behind them to actually give a decent massage. The ones that showed up in my order had 3 wheels in a row in the actual handle, not at all what is pictured. I even passed over other back scratchers that were designed like the ones that showed up because I didn't like the design at all.The scratcher end of doesn't seem to work that great either. I'm not sure what exactly is off about it, but it just doesn't seem to scratch that great.Of course I think I'll probably give them to Goodwill or something because the shipping to get them back from Atlanta to Seattle will probably be as much as the scratchers themselves. I'm definitely not going to give the ones I got for my friend to her because there's no place that you could actually store this and have it be functional. It's so large, she'd have to keep it in the garage, not in the nightstand and under the coffee table as planned.I'd go with something that you KNOW what you're getting and doesn't have a disclaimer saying size and styles vary."

My dad, who is 88 years old and loves everything (foodwise)thought it was ""super"", while my friend Keiko liked the way it tasted, but she didn't care for the way it smelled. It reminded her of oatmeal. So, all in all we thought it was very good and we will definitely be buying more of these, especially since they are gluten free, organic and relatively inexpensive."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"The first and occasional taste of real blue berry made me keep trying another bite, but each time I did I became less satisfied with the bar. I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar, which has a very satisfying taste and texture, but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added. If you like the normal powerbar goo (which I do not), then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting. It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories, but I like to enjoy the food I it as well."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I had enjoyed the Cherry & Cashew bar by ""Pure"" so I thought that I'd give the Blueberry & Cashew bar a try. Some of the same descriptive information applies. The bar is firm & chewy, but not tough, and there are tiny pieces of cashew that give an occasional bit of crunchiness. The sugar content comes solely from the fruit itself. And fortunately, the bar isn't sticky to handle, which is a plus if you eat it on the go. As for the blueberry flavor, I'll say this. If you were to give me one of these bars to eat, and I had to guess what (if any) fruit flavor is in it, I'd be unable to guess. The Blueberry content is definitely there, and the bar tastes good. But I do prefer the cherry & cashew bar."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"This roast wasn't as good as I expected. I loved Cafe Altura's French Roast's very intense (almost spicy) flavor and oiliness, which I often use for espresso. Reading these reviews, I thought New Orleans blend would be similar like the french roast, but slightly smoother. The result? Hmmm... maybe my bag could be just a less great one, but my bag had more burnt taste, less oil, and less oil means less flavor and crema. So the espresso tasted more flat, as if it is less burnt version of spanish roast. It still has same darkness as the french roast, but my guess is that the New Orleans blend is roasted in higher temp. with less time and the french roast is roasted in less temp. but longer. Still, this blend produce much better espresso than Starbucks', and since it tasted above average in americano, this would make great drip coffee."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have been reading all reviews I could find on this product and seems to me that for every positive ""testimonial"" there is a lot of negativity, e.g. explanations on exactly why it scientifically cannot work as advertised it does. Sooooo, although very skeptical and against my better judgement, decided to try it anyway. I have diabetes and I will try just about anything in an effort to get off my medications. I have tried just about every natural ""remedy"" that exists to no avail, so don't know why I hope this works....forever the optimist, I suppose.Anyway, have only been using Cellfood for a few days and I suppose much too soon to notice any changes - if indeed it eventually causes any. BUT - and this may just be coincidental - for the last 3 nights I have literally slept like the dead. I normally wake up several times during the night to run to bathroom then if able to get back to sleep, takes forever and I sleep fitfully, some nights not at all. Since I have been taking Cellfood, have slept well, get up once only for bathroom, go immediately back to sleep and sleep until the alarm goes off. Like I say, could just be coincidence but I so want to believe in something that works!Are there any amazon verified purchasers out there who have had any success with diabetes on this stuff? I am really interested to know and of course I read many testimonials saying it works, but don't trust them all especially when at the same time I read how it cannot possibly work from people who sound scientifically knowledgeable. Who to believe? What to believe? Help!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"As a new mom, I'm often left 'snacking' my meals away throughout the day. This usually means a lot of food in 'bar' form. Given that fact, I prefer eating things that are as tasty as they are healthy.In comparing the Cherry Cashew bar to its Wild Blueberry cousin, it's hands down tastier. I also found the consistency more appealing.At 190 calories for this bar with its mix of nutrient percentages, I'd still say that Cliff bars have an advantage from a shear sustenance standpoint, but I did like the taste of this bar.Overall, good taste, good bar."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"This is a date bar, sure a date is fruit, but a very sweet and not very nutritious one. I still don't understand why dried apricots are not used more in fruit bars. Regardless, this date bar does have the taste of cashews and a satisfying crunch and goo too. The Cherry taste is pretty much non-existent."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I used this in the past and loved it, but when they changed the formula, I decided to use Jarrows or Mt. Capra which are just like Garden of Life used to be before the change. Garden of life cheapened the formula by removing the good stuff(the fermented goat milk protein) and adding a sweetener(makes it grossly sweet). Look at most all Garden of Life products and they use a fermentation process to help predigest for easy assimilation. They removed that key ingredient in the new formula, making this a low quality product when compared to the others(by the way, Mt Capra supplies Garden of Life with main ingredients). On top of that, Garden of Life is more expensive than the other products. I still use Garden of Life-Primal Defense, but cannot recommend this product over the other mentioned brands."

It has no real flavor of its own, which was important to me since I wanted to be able to mix it with both sweet and savory food and drink. It also blends well with both hot and cold liquids, which is also important since I like to use whey protein with soups. Just be sure to not heat your beverage to boiling. It's a great product."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"After I ate this bar, I didn't know if I liked it or not. I still don't know. On one hand, it's sweet and the blueberry taste is quite nice. On the other hand, it feels like it wants to be a granola or candy bar but it fails at both. It seems healthy, almost too healthy. Eating the thing made me feel like my colon was going to be very healthy afterwards.I think I'm going to say that I like it but it is a strange taste and I don't know if I can ever love it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"I have tried many diet pills. I always say this...as a past gym trainer and an expert on diet and nurtition, diet pills should ONLY be used as an extra help in losing the last 10 lbs or so. They shouldn't ever be depended on alone.75% of any results will always be HOW YOU EAT..plain and simple. Working out with light weights or heavy weights also gREATLY helps. But even if you work out 5 hours a day, and eat nothing but fat and high sugar foods, your results will take forever to see..or you will only keep packing on the lbs.Ok..so I started taking these about 5 years ago. I had taken Stacker 2's before and Hydroxycut, and even Trim Spa. Let me say..all those give you a ""boost"" of energy..and slight gitters..BUT..I have never had the jitters that bad--until THIS product.DO NOT TAKE THIS. I was only 25 when I took these and mind you--I was already working out 1 hour a day, and eating clean..I mainly used these to lose about 5lbs..I DID lose about 10 with these..don't get me wrong here...BUT...I was only taking TWO pills a day--one in morning--and one at night. THAT was all I took.(I honestly NEVER take a full serving in ANY diet pill) just because I feel they are loaded with way too much caffiene.)..After taking only 1 of these,,.and took a light nap..a few hours later..I was getting dressed in the bathroom..and started having a panic attack. I NEVER had those before. I don't even have any health problems. I don't even ever get panic attacks..never knew what one was actually like. I felt I was having a minor heart attack or something (minus the chest pains or any nausea)..I was scared SH****LESS. I had to run over to my husband and have him hold me just because I felt I couldn't breath.This pill is dangerous in my opinion. And again, I wasn't even taking a full dosage.not even close. >:(Then after taking the pills I kept having panic attacks for a few months there afterward...even tho I stopped taking them after that.(maybe it was a mind thing after that). I even started having panic attacks when I switched to ZERO caffine Hydroxycut..and they have no jitters at all! I even couldn't drink coffee for months because I was sooo scared that I would start panic-ing.I remember one night I couldn't go to sleep because I felt like I was going to pass out.DONT TAKE THESE. PERIOD.Infact...drinking 12 cups of Green Tea a day works even better--AND gets rid of bloating. ;)Save your money...and save your life by NOT ever taking these.!!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I love to have meal bars in my purse because they are great when I don't have time to stop and eat a snack (and might otherwise reach for fast food). However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor. These Pure bars address this completely. Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients. If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing. The taste is also pretty decent. Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat. It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but it's definitely palatable and does taste like cherry and cashew. I also tried the blueberry flavor and preferred that one (even though I am not generally a blueberry fan), but it was a matter of personal preference.If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar. That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna). Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands. However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this. I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job."

I have tried many and this one offers great taste without the sugariness of many many other bars. It offers a quick pick me up during a long work day. A little pricey for the size but tasty and satisfying. So much better than a vending machine chocolate bar when you are working hard to complete a project !"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Before knowing about D-Mannose I had for 3 years antibiotics in low doses and massive amounts of cranberry powder under medical supervision. This didn't work for me, maybe cranberries made things slightly better but I couldn't get rid completely of the UTIs. When I was desperate I found out about D-Mannose in internet. Now after six months of having half a tea-spoon of D-Mannose in the morning and another half before going to bed I can say that, for the moment, I'm clear of infections. I can hardly believe it, before I use to have up to 1 UTI a month and my day to day was sometimes awful."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I just purchased one of these, put it into the microwave, got all set for a relaxing experience! That would only happen for you, however, IF YOU COULD STAND THE SMELL! No fragrance of eucalyptus or any other herb! My husband agreed with me, we could smell the odor of damp and mold or something. It was hard to identify. You can make your own eye wrap by putting some new clean rice (use white, not brown ... because of the bacteria on brown rice) into a cotton sock and tying up the end of it. This thing, however, is a rip off. ... Oh, I forgot to mention that this little pillow is misshapen and poorly constructed. It's a piece of terry cloth cut roughly into the shape shown in the photo, except it is lopsided and uneven, with some rice dumped into it. Make your own."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been constipated chronically for about three or four months, as well as a loss of appetite. I tried simple things like Milk of Magnesia and Polyethylene Glycol, the typical osmotic laxatives that most doctors recommend, but it only helped me somewhat, and actually caused more gas and discomfort and made me feel as though moisture was building up in my colon and not being expelled soon enough.So then I tried herbal laxative capsules which did work, and didn't cause the moisture build up, but they were only mildly effective at the recommended dose, and I don't feel comfortable going over the recommended dosage for long.Then I found this product. The first time I drank it, it tasted good for what it was, and I actually went above the dosage (steeping two bags at once) because I thought that it would be weak like the capsules. (not the case) About six hours later I began feeling slight discomfort, and went to the restroom, and needless to say I believe my bowels emptied in a matter of seconds. Nothing got caught up, no difficultly or straining, everything came out all at once.I was never using this to lose weight, so I can't vouch for that, but if you want something to clear you out, it will definitely make you FEEL lighter."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I've been imagining having something like this for some time, it does reach those unreachable spots very nicely. I am finding it to be like exercise equipment though, it sits on the sideline unused a lot..though it does work, and help a lot when I use it!I bought this one instead of the other brand because it had the extra curve and extra bumps, but I don't think I'll ever use the extra ones because they are so sharply pointed. The rounded end is good enough for me. I'm even thinking a softer/padded add on might be a good option for some people??I'm sure I'll be using this more as I get used to how to use it. It's a good product for pressure points/ trigger points/ foot reflexology, don't expect a ""gentle massage"" feeling."

Didn't take it again and its been 4 weeks and none of those symptoms again so I know it was the Alli! The product doesn't even suggest those type of symptoms!

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,2.0,"I got this product after using BSN No-Explode only because someone who had never used it wanted me to get it, to try it out. I have to say there is no reason to buy this product. For me it loses badly on three areas. It doesnt dissolve in water. It gets all clumpy and nasty. This not only makes mixing it more difficult, the effects take longer to kick in. (The BSN disolves almost like alka-seltzer). Taste is awful I got the rasberry lemonade. Some people say taste isnt important but if you have to drink the stuff almost everyday and they can taste good why not? The BSN orange taste great and I dont even like orange drinks. Now most important is the pump which again fails for me. The BSN came faster, stronger and lasted for the workout. Great Pump. I called Gaspari and while they were nice and helpful they would not guarantee the product so now I am stuck with it. My advice Buy BSN NO-Explode"

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I am a blueberry fan. I put them in lots of baked goods, eat them fresh every summer. So I was excited to try this bar in blueberry; I've been eating the PURE Cherry bars for some time now. I was surprised by the taste of these bars, neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly, just surprised. They were not very sweet - and the cherry bars are. So this was both good and bad. The cherry bars sometimes are too sweet and I feel like I've eaten candy afterward, whereas the blueberry bars have a subtle sweetness with a mellow flavor. The cashews dominate the taste in these. So, for every day fare, (especially for gluten free people) theses are much more grounding and more food-like than candy like. However, it's not necessarily a taste that I would crave every day. But that's me. They are definitely worth adding to your collection of bars - it's always nice to have variety. Enjoy!"

I'd recomend this to anyone with chronic pain that has muscle spasms!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been prone to IBS for many years. I first started taking this product while on a course of antibiotics at the recommendation of my doctor. My digestive tract felt so wonderful that I kept taking it for several more months. It's expensive, but I decided well worth it.Then one day I popped open a new box. Within 2 days my old symptoms were back. After a week I decided to call the company. I was told to open a capsule and describe what I saw.When I said ""white powder with yellow clumps about the size of dry millet"" the rep said this meant the bacteria had died off. (As I've since read at [....], this can happen if the product is exposed to heat above 90 degrees.) She suggested I return the product to the store.I told her I didn't have the receipt, so she then suggested I send the box back to them and they would replace it. She advised however that they would NOT pay postage to return the product.So now I have to hunt up a box to ship this in, and it is going to cost me a couple of dollars and a trip to the PO just to get what I've already paid for. I'm not happy about this - I had a similar experience with another nutritional company several years ago, and they sent me a postage-paid box in which to return the product.I still recommend this product. The difference it has made in my digestive track has been nothing short of miraculous. But from now on I will open a capsule of each new box first and make sure it is still alive."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"Forget all those sugar-laden, chocolate coated granola and snack bars.

No cholesterol. Gluten-free. It's certified organic. It's a snack you can feel good about putting in your child's lunchbag.The blueberry bar had a good raw flavor - predominantly nuts (almonds, cashews and walnuts) - with the taste of wild blueberries.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,4.0,"Obviously rice isn't a low-carb food per se, but this wild blend has significantly less impact on my blood sugar than the jasmine variety I grew up eating. It's flavorful and has a wonderful chew -- and it cooks up just fine in a rice cooker (we use 1.5 cups of liquid per cup of rice). The 6-pack boxes we order two sets at a time keep us stocked for a few weeks. We do find, however, that the rice doesn't smell very good after only a little while in the storage bin. Doesn't change the flavor or its smell once you've cooked it, but I'd recommend washing out your storage container between refills."

It would have been nice for a small instruction sheet ... but the product is simply made and it took me almost an hour to figure out how to use it. I already have improvement in my singing voice and breath control. I even sent an email to the vendor with my complaints and all I got in return was a complete product catalog of all their musical instruments and other items they sell.All in all - - I still believe my money was well-spent.Harry Rhodes"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I was certainly glad to find that I had stuck my Pure Bar in my jacket pocket on a recent flight, when the only other offerings keeping me from starvation were airplane peanuts, so this review is definitely right-leaning in its bias. After not having had breakfast, this little bar of blueberryness made everything right with the world. It's certified vegan, Kosher, and organic (""no artificial nothin'""), no gluten, no trans fats, and it fills up the corners. Because of all its pluses, I would buy it again; on the side of fairness, however, it has the same amount of calories most bars of its type have, and while it is good, it doesn't knock itself out of the park. Shortly put, it's satisfying, and fills the needs of many who need to watch their intake of certain ingredients."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I started out the year with a vow to watch my diet and take better care of myself. These small bags of nuts help me do that. A good snack for a packed lunch or just something to keep in your desk at work, to help you fend of the less-healthy stuff in the company vending machine or break room.Nice variety to change things up. Yes, a little more expensive than buying in bulk, but the packaging helps with portion control. Without the small packaging, I'd be snacking on these things all day!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I bought this heated footbath for my man who suffers from pain in his feet and legs due to nerve damage. He loves it and I enjoy using it too. It gets really hot, which is very therapeutic. It is made well, very sturdy. The jets work great, and the pumice is nice for sloughing off dead skin. I had been searching a while for a quality HEATED foot spa, and I highly recommend this one."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"Personally, I like a ""regular"" granola bar much better. This doesn't look appetizing. . .and quite frankly, it doesn't taste all that good. Perhaps this is just too ""sophisticated"" for me. It sounds so good, but it's just kind of ""yucky"" in your mouth and you want to swallow as soon as possible."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I was given the Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar to review for Amazon Vine. I am always on the lookout for bars like this, especially given my attempt to lose weight this year.The Pure bar is a great filling snack. So many bars and snacks are lightweight and airy and don't satisfy. But the Cherry Pure bar really does fill you up and it tastes really good. The combination of the Cherry taste and the cashews and nuts is really a great taste.My only contention is that if you just want a light snack--this is not really it. Its pretty heavy. But if you're in the middle of the day or you want something quick for breakfast, I highly recommend it. Gives you energy and fills you up fast."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,Basically this bar tastes like a fig newton without the pastry outer layer. That's what it reminded me of.I guess if you are craving something sweet and nutritious this might be the way to go. I wasn't excited by it.The cherry taste was good though. I'm not into fruit bars much but I can't fault this product.I've tasted better fruit bars such as the PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have to fight migraines and arthritis daily. Being a pharmacist, I have access to a lot of different gel pack and similar products. This one excels by a wide margin for the neck, sinuses and forehead. It also works very well for the knee. The gel pack gets cold enough to be effective, which is where many competitors fail. But it is not too stiff to wrap around the treatment area. The sleeve and velcro-like closure are comfortable and keep the pack in place. I wish I could buy replacement sleeves, because they usually wear out before the gel pack does. Both professionally and personally, I think this is absolutely the best product of its kind."

Easy to set up, allowing my son to have a seat just about anywhere we go. He's comfortable, and the cover on the tray allows for a quick cleanup, since he's not eating on his own yet. I highly recommend this product!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I was surprised how good this tasted. It taste similar, though not exactly like it was fruit leather. It had just the right balance of nuts without seeming too much. Obviously taste will very, so you are probably best to try one before buying 12.Typically, Organic = Expensive. But for $20 you get 12, which i think is pretty reasonable priced for these. If you are into fitness or eating healthy, this may be something you really enjoy."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"If you suffer from chronic backaches, neck pain or headaches (and probably any kind of chronic pain)this is the device for you.I have visited a chiropractor for 30 years with chronic backaches. Through body work that I have been doing for the last couple of years I have learned that posture problems (not helped by working on a computer) have lead to this problem by creating trigger points.I was a little leery of this given the price and the torture chamber looks, but I researched it and it received very positive reviews on fibromyalgia boards. And really one and a half massages or a couple of trips to the chiropractor (to which I have not been since I bought this), it will pay for itself. I was able to use my flexible spending dollars to pay for it.Then last week, I discovered it works beautifully for headaches. I woke up with a bad headache one morning - the kind that I actually dreamed about before I woke up. Nothing would touch it, including over-the-counter medications, prescription pain killers, and sinus medicine (previous attempts to cure this type of headache with prescription migraine medicine did not help either). When I still had it the NEXT morning, I thought I would try out the Fenix Rehab system. I worked on the trigger points in my neck and shoulders for about 30 minutes, stretched out those muscles, took a hot shower, and NO MORE HEADACHE. I really could not believe I went an entire day without using it - you see, it hurt so bad I just didn't feel like lying down and working on it.My only advice would be to also get the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, which comes up on Amazon as ""other items people purchased"" when on the Fenix Rehab page. I have had this book a couple of years and worked with it a lot. So I had a pretty good working knowledge of trigger points and how to work them. (Just nothing works this well).The Fenix Rehab comes with a video and a pamphlet explaining it all and how to use it, but my learning curve was much less steep since I was so familiar with trigger point therapy through the book."

They tend to like pizza etc. These protein bars give me the energy and have 20 grams of protein that I need, I am a vegetarian. I find that they also cure my chocolate craving and are good enough for me to consider them my mid afternoon treat. With three children I often do not have time to eat. I would highly recommend them to any person who needs to eat on the run. I have them on auto ship as with a 9 month old, I cannot always get to a store that carries them. The price is very competitive if ordering from Amazon. Believe me, I have checked."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet. The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options"

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Like many people out there, i've used an electric pump and was sceptical about a manual one. Let me just say that this pump is great. The only thing i realized fairly quickly is that although it advertizes that it can express milk as fast as an electric pump, which in my experience it can, it's still only doing one side at a time. So when i realized how good it was, i went out and got another one! Now while pumping with my right and left hands, i was indeed filling the bottles as quickly as i did with the pump-in-style.I work in many different places, and dragging around a big motor and tubes and plugs that had to be connected and plugged was very annoying. Not to mention heavy, in addition to my work items that i have to lug to and from my car too. I also did not always have access to an outlet, or space to spread out. The last thing you want to do is put your pump on the floor of a germ-infested bathroom stall. I was also never a fan of having people walking into a restroom hearing the whine of an electric pump and knowing what i'm doing and where. But the Avent is lightweight and plug free. It's quiet. It goes straight onto the avent bottles, or i often pumped into the Avent storage cups so it could go right into the fridge or freezer when i got home. And i personally found the hand levers very comfortable. A friend of mine told me she even keeps one Avent pump in her car in case of emergencies, like if she is stuck away from home and it's expressing time. If you are looking for a manual pump, this is definitely the way to go. And if you are open to electric or manual, this is definitely one you should be looking into!"

The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad.

It is a great space saver, allows everything to dry quickly and I have never had a problem with it. It is durable for what it is meant to do.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"For a seasoned pepper fanatic like me the private reserve Jolokia ghost pepper 2010 is a rich addition to a well stocked hot store. I find the taste surprisingly balanced for a product with an estimated 700,000 Scoville score. The Jolokia is unmistakably present in the flavor without dominating it. Use with caution as it is at the edge of becoming a food additive instead of hot sauce."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"Salt makes this taste good. I hate to say it but this stuff has been sitting on my pantry shelf for months and months. After making my first cup of hot soup (very easy, by the way, just add water and microwave....), I thought it tasted bitter and a bit flat. So, out of desperation, lately, I had nothing for snacking, so I made myself a cup of this soup. I added some soy sauce (don't know why). That made it absolutely delicious - salt was what it needed. Salt has that ability to 'fix' what is lacking. And it certainly fixed this for me. It has a very good taste, once adjusted with just a little bit of salt."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've been studying neurochemistry for many years, and i am not a doctor. This is just some simple chemistry. Griffonius is 40% 5-htp by weight. 5-htp is a form of tryptophan commonly created by stomach bacteria. If you do not have depression, anxiety, or insomnia, this is probably not for you. In my experience, 5-htp is vastly superior to all pharmaceutical anti-depressants. Depression is a lack of serotonin, it's really that simple. 5-htp is the serotonin precursor. Insomnia is a lack of melatonin, and serotonin is the melatonin precursor. Anxiety is caused by heightened cortisol and adrenalin, commonly brought on by a serotonin deficiency, but can be brought on by other things.5-htp metabolizes into Serotonin in the brain, but not in the blood. If anyone gets serotonin syndrome from this supplement, I think it's very probable they took a metabolite with it. You should look up anything you are taking at the same time for an interaction, and definitely avoid taking anything at the same time as serotonin that contains the warning ""do not take with anti-depressants/SSRIs."" 5-htp is not an SSRI but the effect is much like a very potent SSRI.Excessive use of 5-htp can lead to a down-regulation of the 5-ht1a memory receptor, while this is by no means a reason not to take it, measuring your dosage and time of use is a good idea. I humbly suggest that no one exceed 200mg per day without an okay from their physician, and that they not take it at this level long term, like for more than a year. Also, if you have a physician and take other medications or are considering taking other medications, you must tell your doctor that you are taking 5-htp.I know of now reason why this product should cause nausia or gallstone like pain. It's a pretty simple anti-depressant and shouldn't do anything outside of the brain. It is also an amino acid, so it will potentially interact with other medications."

He loves these as he knows he can have a meal on the table in 20 minutes. These are also a good way to introduce those who have never had real Indian cuisine, since most are not that spicy/hot.

I could even smell the aromatic little gems through the plastic wrap. I have not yet used them to make my vanilla bean ice cream so I am not sure about the amount of ""flecks"" that seemed to bother one reviewer... but I gotta tell you... as plump, as soft and as fragrant as these beans are I just know they will make great ice cream. I used them to make my own vanilla extract and my entire house smelled wonderful! Not sure why some other reviewers didn't find them as aromatic... must be a bum batch. Sorry that happened to them. I hope that doesn't happen to me as I will be ordering more and more and more of these. Anyhow, after using 30 beans to make 10 little jars of vanilla extract I still have quite a few beans left to make tons of other vanilla laced goodies. Excellent product and I couldn't be more thrilled with them. :)"

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"When we found out my grandson had head lice a couple of weeks ago, my daughter did the chemical hair wash treatment. I knew the treatment would have to be repeated at least once, and since I'm uncomfortable with chemicals, I did some research on the internet.I found the electronic Robi-Comb and this Nit Free Terminator had the best reviews, so I got both. The Robi-Comb arrived first, and when we tried it, I was initially impressed. It did comb out some very tiny lice, but after a couple of days it stopped working. Then we received this comb, the Nit Free Terminator, and I was totally amazed to see what the Robi-Comb missed, much of which I believe was nits.I can't say for certain this comb gets every single nit off every single hair strand, but considering the life stages of lice, I am not concerned. After an egg is attached to the hair strand, it takes about a week for it to hatch. Then there is about another week before the nymphs can lay eggs. If you discover you have head lice and use this comb every day until nothing else comes out, then use it two or three times a week to remove any bugs that might have hatched, you will be lice free.The nits (eggs) will slide off the hair shaft easier if you first wet all the hair with distilled vinegar, cover the head with a plastic shower cap or wrap in saran wrap and leave it on for an hour. Remove the cap, comb through with a regular comb to remove tangles, then comb through with the Nit Free comb, wiping it off after every pass or swishing it in a bowl of water. The vinegar dissolves the glue that holds the nits on the hair, plus the vinegar helps the comb glide through the hair. After sufficient combing, wash the hair as usual. Even if you miss a nit and the thing hatches, using this comb religiously will eventually eliminate the lice problem.And regarding treating your house or your carpet, please don't use poisonous sprays. Just wash your bedding in hot water, dry in a hot dryer and do some vacuuming, but don't stress about it. A live louse can only live about 2 days without a blood meal, and an egg can't hatch without the warmth from your head. As long as it isn't in contact with you, it won't live long. And as long as you're using the comb, if a live one does get in contact with you, you will be combing it out.Three ladies in New York have opened several lice removal salons, and they use this exact same comb. You can find them on YouTube by searching for fairylicemothers (all one word).From now on, I will never recommend chemicals or any other treatment besides this comb. I'm convinced it is ALL you need, and I'm informing everyone I know about the Nit Free Terminator."
health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,"I've been taking this Multivitamin for over a year and so far I've noticed a huge reduction in hot flashes and rarely any night sweats. My mood swings have also diminished a lot, and I never feel fatigued either. I like that in addition to the herbs that help with the menopausal symptoms, the vitamins are in the right amount of dosage necessary for women over 50. I especially like that it has the recommended amounts of calcium and Vit D3. The only drawback is taking the four tablets every day, but I guess it's the only way to get all the benefits that this product offers. If one or two tablets daily would've been the recommended dosage, I would've given it a 5 star. Overall, very pleased with it so far and I've recommended it to various friends. BTW...I am enrolled in Amazon's autoship program, which prevents me from skipping my daily intake, and it saves me money too!"

Tha being said, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this for the same purpose."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,This heating pad is the best I've ever used. It's flexible and wraps around where you need the heat the most. It has elastic straps to stretch where you need and includes extensions. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I did not have any particular faith in glucosamine or glucosamine/chontroitin as beneficial for joint health and joint pain until a friend told me her experience with her knee pain and disablilty that resolved on this product.Based on this anecdotal story, I decided that I had little to loose investing in a 3 month supply. I have a structurally abnormal right hip (hip dysplasia)and as a result of my years of running and other exercise before my diagnosis of hip dysplasia (in my 50's), I have arthritis in that hip.It was to the point that sometimes I was limping. I can say that now I don't even notice that there is pain in my hip. I don't even think about it.Before cosamin DS, I was always aware of my right hip and would take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when the pain was bad. Now, no analgesics. I will be ordering this product from now on.Incidentally, they make a veterinary product which my cat is on for his arthritis."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"My doctor was on me for a pretty long time to get an id tag but I really didn't want one. I finally realized it is something very important to have on, especially if you work away from people who know you are diabetic. After wearing it a while you forget you even have it on. It is very discrete and lightweight."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"The PROS:1. I like the design2. in my case the unit fit my mouth quite well.3. not as noticeable (annoying) when wearing, as other mouthguards out there.The CONS:1. bite pieces should be made of harder materials.I only got about 30-45 days out of mine, before the plastic pieces (2 plastic parts that you bite on)were almost cut in half.My .02 cents of these items.First, the degree to which Bruxism affects people is very ""Subjective"".In which case I still have not encountered a true ""One-size-fits-all"" product that worked very long.I would like to see at least 3 styles of sets, of plastic bite parts.I mean, after all, the price of the amount of plastic involved is like pennies.1. Ideally they should offer a sort of ""starter set"" that would provide 3 different sets of bite pieces.a. One set of softb. One set of medium hardc. One set of almost indestructible bite pieces.Personally to prevent night grinding:1. I went back to the $1 or $2 ones from walmart/kmart.The adult style of ""boil for 30 seconds until the plastic is software, then bite into them"".For under $20 bucks (at 1 per each month) you would have a years worth of mouth guards.I change them out at every 2-4 weeks.2. Rotate them occasionally and have you dentist monitor your teeth.(my dentist had a million reasons why her ""$1 piece of plastic, which she would be selling me at $200+,was so superior to my home made mouthguard. Naturally her mouthguard was NOT covered by insurance).3. IMPORTANT"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"What first attracted me to the Lapsang Souchong variety of tea leaf is the distinct Latakia-like smoky flavor. This particular variety strikes me as unusually light on the smokiness. Granted my experience has so far been limited to the Twinings variety that comes in tea bags and the variety sold by Le Pain Quotidien bakeries. I thought that perhaps letting this tea steep a bit longer might help, but I've found that by the 5 minute point, the tea becomes disappointingly bitter and sour. I guess if you're looking for a more subtle, mild version of Lapsang Souchong this might be perfect."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I would highly recommend this product. I have tried many different massage devices and none of them have compard to this one. The knobs on this item give you a very deep massage that really opens up the muscles and takes the knots away. You only need to apply a slight pressure for a deep massage. And since there are so many knobs, it is very easy to get every part of your body. My mother has very tights knots in her shoulders and this was a lifesaver for her."

Plus with the added boost, together we have lost over 70 pounds!!! We are ordering our third shipment and continue to recommend this line of products to family and friends.

baby products,feeding,food,1.0,"I don't know if it works. It is still in it's plastic wrap. The reason I am writing a review is because I did not have to use it. I used a hand blender all the time when I had to puree food. When she was old enough to eat regular food, she didn't want pureed food any more. Just about everyone has a blender or food processor. Spend your money on something like more ice cube trays (to freeze your baby food) and pyrex containers (to store and heat up your babies food)."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I like using stevia because it is natural. the powder is hard to measure for tea and too much is awful. These tabs (3 to a giant mug of hot tea) are the perfect sweet. This seller packages the tabs with a desiccant pouch which keeps them loose.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"Soft enough to place on top of the fitted sheet, urine does not seep through. Easy to wash, air dry during the day and it is ready again at bed time. Happy with the first one, we bought another just in case...

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I am 44 years old and I have tried almost everything that has come down the pike! I was not a skeptic of VPX NO-Shotgun. I knew they would deliver on their promise to get me jacked up, pumped up, and ripped up with their product. However, did it really say ""Grape Bubblegum"" as a flavor on the package? I was like, I aint no kid! Well I tried it and MAN that is the best tasting supplement I have ever used! Whoever is coming up with the flavors at VPX keep up the great work! I felt like I was drinking a soda! Thank you for making my supplements easier to ""swallow""! LOL"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"About 15 years ago I bought my first Reach Easy Massager to help me deal with knee and back issues. Since we spend part of the year in Michigan and the rest of the year in Arizona, I decided to buy a second massager. My old Reach Easy works great. However, I cannot make that statement about the newer model. I do not like the way this massager works. It makes either a chopping or slapping movement. Additionally, I have not been able to get it to just vibrate at the correct intensity for my knees, hands, feet or upper arms.The one positive thing I can say is that the newer model reaches the center of my lower back better than the older model does. The curve design makes it easier to use on the lower back area.So, if you are looking for a massager that chops and slaps, this just might be the one for you. However, if you are like me and looking for a massager that can be used on joint areas, you might want to consider buying a different massager.July, 2010Well after using the massager for a while, I have to add to my comments. I have gotten use to the chopping and slapping on my lower back. I use the massager 15 minutes on the right side and then 15 minutes on the left. Afterwards my back feels great, even better than when I used my older massager. However, I haven't adjusted to the chopping and slapping motion on my knee joints, yet. I hope that eventually I will get use to the amount and type of pressure that the massager exerts on my knees.Overall, I am pleased with the massager."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I wasn't a fan of the taste of this variety. I have tried both the blueberry and the cherry cashew, and I much prefer the blueberry. The size is adequate for a snack, and the texture is fine - I was just put off by the taste.I like that these use organic ingredients and are primarily a fruit and nut bar. It would make me feel better about snacking than if I were to eat a candy bar. However, I wouldn't get this flavor if given a choice."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had tried for several years to take something to lower my cholesterol. The meds which do this are all called statins.Each time I tried one and then later switched to a new one, I would get what felt like flue-like symptoms after I had taken the statin. Every 5 days or so, I""d feel like I had a fever, aches, lethargy and more. Just like a mild flu. Sadly, I had to stop taking any meds to lower my cholesterol after trying 5 different statins.I went for an unrelated assessment and the nurse practitioner told me about CoQ10. I bought some and now take 100mg in the morning and at night with my statin med. It has worked. I can now take the statin. I plan on trying to reduce the amount from 200mg a day to 100 mg a day and see how that works."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This product was recommended to me over 30 years ago when my daughter was born. I thought at the time that it was the most amazing moisturizer I'd ever seen. But it was really hard to find, only showing up in the dusty back of the baby aisles. After a few years, I couldn't find it at all, but kept looking. I was absolutely delighted to finally find it again, unchanged.It's a shame that the product has such an awful name. It's not that it isn't any good for stretch marks, it absolutely rocks. But it makes your skin feel just wonderful and soft, without being greasy. I've even had people comment on the softness of my skin. It makes a great face cream as well, and even smells great. And a small amount goes a long way, so don't let the price scare you, it's worth every penny, and more.I realize I sound like a commercial, but I looked for this for so long without success, I can't help being enthusiastic. I also want others to find this and buy it, so it stays on the market where it belongs. Do try it, not just for stretch marks, but for dry skin, or just general moisturizing. I promise, you'll be glad you did!"

It doesn't smell good, no, but your baby will LOVE it. And there's a great chance you will end up with a happy, relaxed, smiling baby just a few days later. It worked wonders for us."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This product is the best ever, trust me when I say this. I had Gastric by-pass surgery, so I have to drink alot of these kinds of shakes. This by far is the best,tasting smooth as silk. I just love it all the flavors are wonderful. The protein you get from it is wonderful. Try it is GREAT!!!!!!!! Amazon is great to deal with good prices and shipping is fast."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I put about thee tablespoons or more into a small bowl and add dipping seasonings. I mix it with a spoon and then dip fresh bread in it. I keep it on my counter top with the bread and occassionally grab a piece of bread and dip it. Mmmmm. Makes all that fishy not taste fishy and the lemon makes it so special. I have had friends for dinner and served it up with hot bread before the meal. Raves from all! Getting all of those vitamins and fish oil benefits while enjoying it. I don't digest pills very well and having the pure oil digest easier makes all the difference in my vitamin intake.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I received the product within a few days after I ordered it. I have tried pancakes and also the sour cream coffee cake recipe that is on the outside of the bag, I am impressed and it tastes so good. I have a daughter that is celiac and I am learning more and more about the gluten-free products. I would recommend this baking mix to anyone as it makes very good recipes. My husband tried the sour cream coffee cake, and he loves it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"This is a good product (good quality Kava root - no stems or leaves - and nice tasting), but you have to use at least 2 tea bags to get the feeling you would get from traditional Kava (relaxing and elated feeling). As far as convenience goes this is an easy way to get Kava but the increased number of bags used factors into the cost."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,3.0,"I bought two 12 packs of this brand. It tastes ok to me, but I haven't compaired it to the other brands yet. The high amount of vitamin C contained in one serving has me concerned. I found I got a canker sore the next day after drinking my first box. I also wonder how they can call it 100% pure if it has added Vitamin C - which they would have to do in order to get a 230% daily value - that's about 138mg of vita c, and the normal amount (I found while net surfing) is about 5 mg per 8oz serving, which should make this no more than 10 mg of vita c for 11.2 oz. I will use this up(hopefully) with food prep and meals, but it's too much vita c for me to drink a box every day."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I used every product available at the store, the sprays and plastic combs, even a metal comb and shampoos. Nothing was working - every few days a few more lice would pop up. I bought this comb hoping it would work as a last resort. This and tea tree oil and olive oil worked.We also used the electric nit comb that zaps the bugs. But this comb was really what we needed in the first place. The spaces are so tiny it actually grabs every egg in the hair. I don't really understand why the shampoo kits don't include this comb or even sell this comb in a retail store. This comb was even better than the metal comb we bought at Sally's beauty supply store.... I highly recommend it. After weeks of checking for lice and reapplying shampoo and cream. It is FINALLY gone!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"The doctor told me to lose weight or I'm going on insulin in 3 months, so I'm desperately looking for healthy food choices and not worried so much about taste. With about 385 calories per can; 35 calories from fat; 157mg of sodium (7% RDA); 17g protein; and a whopping 28g of fiber, these cans fit the bill. Yes, they don't have a great flavor, but mixed with some cooked quinoa or brown rice and added tuna or sardines, these are very good."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"These pads are not absorbent. I have an older bichon; not a large dog. In the past, I have used the 4-paws Wee-wee pads, and they work very well. I purchased these ""Wee Wee and Housebreaking Training Pads,"" because I thought I would try to get them in bulk, and the description says they are ""highly absorbent."" Well, I certainly did get lots and lots of them, but it was no bargain, because I have to put down so many of them. These pads are barely better than putting papertowel on the floor for the dog to pee on. If I am not able to pick up the pad right after he pees, then it seeps to the edge of the pad, and onto the floor. I really don't understand the reviews that like the product, unless they haven't tried anything else. I recommend against using these pads, if you are trying to protect your floors from the effects of dog urine."

It's been going on for a year.He keeps saying he'll get a sleep study done. Lately, it's been as bad as when our babies were first born.In the meantime, we've tried Breathe Right strips, which have worked on and off.Still...when they haven't worked, it's meant absolutely no sleep for me.I've tried sleeping pills, which work, but I don't want to become overly dependent on them.When I lose sleep, it affects my appearance, my performance at work, my nervous system.I've tried other ear plugs but they really hurt my ears a lot! I gave up on the idea of ear plugs altogether.Until I Googled ""best ear plugs for snoring"" and Ohropax came up.Seriously, I was ready to pay up to $100 for plugs...anything for one night of uninterrupted sleep.I tried these out without much hope. I figured they would hurt just like the others. They don't!Because they're wax, they mold to my ear and are very, very comfortable.They really do muffle out sound and I've been sleeping really well. This is my 3rd night using them and I'm so happy.I mean, my husband still needs to do that sleep study but in the meantime, these ear plugs have been such a help.Highly recommend."

But I really want to let people know that this worth to try. Hope that this work for you as much as how this get rid of the pain that I have for years."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"After continual disappointment with the varieties of granola and muesli available in our community I decided to giveBob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 18-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)a shot. My husband and I are extremely delighted with this mix and have quickly gone through the four 18oz bags that came in or initial order. In fact, we just reordered it in the larger 40oz bags (Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)) because the cost per ounce is a little less expensive.It can be a little boring to eat the same thing over and over again each morning so mix it up by having small Ziplock baggies of various raw nuts and dried fruit available to add as a topping. In our house, walnuts and extra raisins are a big hit though we also enjoy adding fresh fruit or a dollop of preserves from time to time.In the weeks that we have been eating this Muesli, both my husband and I have been amazed with how much more efficiently our bodies are digesting and eliminating waste. We not only feel better, but we are finding that we are looking better too. While keeping the old adage of ""all things in moderation"", we only eat a third cup of this cereal each morning mixed in with a half cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt and find that we rather miss it if we opt for something else!"

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"The directions say one or two tablets to relax and three to fight occasional sleeplessness. I've found that it takes three to induce real drowsiness. On the other hand, two are very effective for stopping my brain from its tendency to keep running like a hamster in an exercise wheel. When the wheel slows down, I can usually fall asleep. The sleep is restful and there is no residual groggyness the next day.I also use two tablets when I'm upset or angry about something that happened during the day. It just helps me relax without the downsides of alcohol or other alternatives. Usually, in those cases, if I'm tired, I can then fall asleep naturally.I've used it in combination with melatonin and other mild sleepaids when I know I need to sleep; I'm tense; and I'm just not drowsy. I used in on a transoceanic flight just to help me relax and rest.For me, the bottom line is that Calms Forte won't simply knock me out. It allows me to reduce tension and fall asleep naturally or, occasionally with the help of another sleepaid. I gave it five stars because it works to that end better than anything else I've tried that's over-the-counter.Update"

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"My ENT Specialist first recommended ENTSOL Spray when I was pregnant with my daughter. At the time I was on year round allergy medication and taking 2 types of nasal spray. When I got pregnant I had to stop the nasal sprays. I normally was also using steroids and antibiotics a couple of times a year for sinus infections. We were talking about sinus surgery before I got pregnant. No one local sold ENTSOL Spray so I tried some other brands and didn't notice any relief. I then ordered ENTSOL from Amazon. 1 can of the 100ml lasts WAY longer then the store brands. It works a million times better too! ENTSOL Spray twice a day and using a steamer when needed kept me free from sinus issues the entire pregnancy. I also continued to use it afterwards. This course keep me free from the normal medications that I had needed before. I'm not pregnant with Triplets and having a lot of problems again. I ran out of the ENTSOL spray and could only find it for over $40 a bottle. That was a little steep for me, but I was about to buy it anyway because I was desperate when I found it for around $25 again. I immediately bought it at the price. Already getting some relief. I highly recommend this product for anyone with sinus and allergy issues. It works very well and is totally worth the price. Plus it will last longer then your store brands."

For a while it worked and kind of got me regular, I didn't even finish a bottle so I don't know how accurate I can review it. I managed to get myself regular just by watching my diet and so I have no need for a colon cleanse product. However of all the colon cleansers out there if you want to use one this would be the one I would actually recommend you try. But I would make sure you try it over a long weekend because you will spend a lot of time in the restroom at first."

But I found these on a whim and tried them in my running shoes and I have not had a single foot issue since. They are a bit bulky if you try to stuff your shoe pad on top of them (which is required as they don't go the whole foot) but I have not had a single issue with my feet since starting to wear these. I've actually been amazed.

I've been diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and use this every evening or morning after taking a hot bath and it helps to relive the pain temporarily. I have just begun medical treatment and I need other care to deal with the knots, but the Back Buddy has been a great adjunct."

This is the best protein supplement I have used. I personally like the vanilla a little better, but the chocolate is great too. Both flavors are lightly sweetened with stevia, and have only 3g of sugar, while delivering 24g of protein per serving. I usually mix it in skim milk with a spoon (takes about a minute of vigorous stirring), but for best results, use a blender or a shaker bottle."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Okay, this sounds crazy. I selected this heating pad for an unusual use. I wanted to make yogurt, and I didn't want to buy a only-does-one-thing, takes-up-valuable-real estate, yogurt maker.I saw Alton Brown make yogurt using a heating pad, and I loved the idea that this appliance can be used to make yogurt, help rise bread-dough, help with muscle aches, preheat a chilly bed, or warm seedlings when it is too cold to put them outside. Now that's what I call VERSATILE!This heating pad is great because it is larger than the standard, has NO AUTO-OFF (which is an essential point for my use), has a washable cover, long cord, and is easy to operate. I haven't had it a long time, so I cannot speak to its longevity.So far, I have raised bread dough and made yogurt with this heating pad. I couldn't be happier with it. Both uses turned out picture-perfect. For yogurt I used the ""medium"" setting around a covered glass pitcher, with a down comforter encircling both of those. It kept the mixture right at 106F. (I checked the temp of the heating pad alone, and it does get very toasty.) Next time, I will see how it works inside a zippered cooler with the heating pad and covered glass pitcher. My bread dough also raised nice and high. (I've also tried it in an oiled slow cooker, and that works too.)Love this heating pad. Glad to have a multipurpose item in the house. It's clearly no one-hit-wonder. How will you use yours?"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"If you are a runner and ever experience tight leg muscles, you need the Tiger Tail. Although its hard to believe, this little thing can stave off shin splints and knee pain, among other running issues. It is amazing how many problems tight calf muscles can cause. For me, they were causing knee pain and shin splints. After using the Tiger Tail, the shin splints and knee pain quickly went away. It's almost a cure-all for running injuries. Check it out--the price is right compared to doctors visits and physical therapy. Also recommended is the TP massage baller."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,3.0,"This stuff tastes like nothing I've ever tasted before -- it's sickly sweet but not in a pleasant way -- not tart like Dex4 tabs or refreshing like some liquids. It also doesn't work as fast but very nearly.That said it's a must for diabetic SCUBA divers who might experience hypoglycemia while diving -- it takes a little practice but you can use it underwater so you don't have to surface if you start feeling the hypoglycemic slump coming on. A tube of this and a little moderation of activity and you can avoid a full-on blood sugar crash. No muss, no fuss, no emergency in the water.NOT recommended for people who can't feel the drop or are not aware when they are hypoglycemic. Divers' Alert Network has more info on DWD (Diving While Diabetic)."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,2.0,"Not being a food chemist, I'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian ""meats."" I really like most veggie-based patties, ""chicken"" bits, and breakfast sausages. However, the various ""brats"" that I so desperately want to grill are, for the most part, terrible. And I don't just mean ""not meat-like."" I mean, they don't taste very good.The food chemists at the famous Monell Chemical Senses Center have, as I remember, ""hamburger in a vial."" That is, with your eyes closed, they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face, when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product.So how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst?In this case, it's jerky. It kinda looks okay (needs more imperfections... lumps and bumps), has somewhat the same consistency (you gotta pull hard or break off a piece), and, as far as the ""original hickory pepper"" flavor, you can tell it has pepper.But that first bite made me think of those veggie brats. Not a good association.I guess this just needs to be an acquired taste. I do appreciate the effort... the vegan product, the non-GMO soy, and the low-fat (in this case, 0 grams of fat) product.But can't those Monell scientists work up a vial of ""jerky taste and smell?""I'll be waiting."

For the sake of the family, I made many trips to the pharmacy to find a cure. At last, I found a single packet of this at CVS and we are all much happier. As other reviews have said, it is not pretty; the patch puffs up a lot and looks a bit like a chew. However it lasts for a long time and there is no medicinal taste. I have used the patch myself and would highly recommend it. I have not tried any other similar product because this product fits all my criteria."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My daughter is now almost 5 months old. The first month of her life I tried every product for gas sold at walmart and Walgreens with no help. Finally after much research on gas drops, gripe waters, and other aids; I purchased Woodward's Gripe Water. It was the best thing I did for my baby. We have a very happy baby. If she has gas or is hungry, she cries, but all other times, she is very happy. This product really is amazing. I have been wanting to video it so you can witness for yourself. When the baby cries because of gas, I give her the recommended dose for her age and sit her up and pat her back. Within five minutes (usually less than 2) she either releases a ton of gas or burps a lot or both. After it is passed she is happy go lucky again and if it is nighttime goes right to sleep. Truely amazing to see. Worth every penny. I wish I had known about this when my other child was a baby. And anytime it doesn't work, then the baby wasn't crying about gas pains. Honestly this product is worth a try. I have wasted so much money on expensive name brands that didn't give my child any relief. Why would I buy anything else when this truely helps my baby feel better. I will also be buying this for upcoming baby showers. I will work on getting a video of her taking the medicine. Everyone who witnesses it is amazed."

Have been using another product for several years with only moderate relief. Our first use of Flexall 454gave far superior results in a very short time! Would recomend this product with five stars. The one down side is the rather strong smell of Euciliptus, so you would probably not want to applyif you are going out to dinner or a show after application. A rather interesting side benefit ............. I have mild Carple Tunnel in my right hand and after applying Flexall 454 with my right hand to my wifes back a couple of times I experienced a major reduction in my Carple Tunnel symptoms!"

When I tried the bottled formula, I didn't realize that the formula was any different...I just thought it was a new bottle. My reaction to every sip was that it tasted and smelled very plastic-y. It seemed that sitting in the plastic bottle was imparting a plastic flavor to the drink. I couldn't even finish the drink and immediately wrote a letter to Zico asking for the Tetra Pak back! I then did a little research and realize that this is the new flavor of this formula using a new variety of coconut and from concentrate. I really don't like this new flavor at all. I will not be buying this product in the bottle again."

health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"I ordered two types of waterproof pads from KCK Industries - Two of the Blue Max 34x36 pads and two of the Sahara 34x36. The Blue Max were billed at $12.72 each and the Sahara's were billed at $21.49 each. I thought Sahara's might be a better quality since they were almost twice the price.The order arrived with all 4 pads in the same box. I noticed the sealed packaging looked very similiar on all 4 pads. Upon closer inspection I noticed that all of the manufacturer packaging/description in the sealed wrapping was EXACTLY the same on all 4 pads including the UPC code # and the Manufacturer Product #. The only thing that indicated these products were two ""different"" pads was an added printed sticker on the outside of the package - two said Blue Max and two said Sahara.I have never been displeased with a product I have ordered through Amazon but I was very disappointed and felt a bit betrayed to received the exact same product but paying almost twice as much for the two ""Sahara"" pads. I didn't even open the pads, I was so annoyed I simply logged on to Amazon and returned them. I will never order from KCK Industries again."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price. Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.I like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days. The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet. The result is a beautifully browned, light, crunchy, low fat, flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon, orange roughy, tuna, chicken or even rib eye steak.Fisherman's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad, scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad. I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham, tomato and lettuce sandwiches, BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps. It also makes a quick and tasty salad dressing using olive oil and apple cider or balsamic vinegar. The uses for this wonderful spice blend are limited only by your culinary imagination."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I'm a senior who for medical reasons has to work out with weights. Some of it I've found very difficult, and this magical potion seems to help quite a bit. I don't know if it's the practice that suddenly makes it seem easier, or the No-Shotgun, but it certainly feels better. So I will keep it up, both the exercise and the No-Shotgun!I also gave some to a muscle guy who works out all the time at the gym and is an old timer when it comes to lifting things, and he just loved it. Said it gave him power he had never felt before. He liked the taste too, which really does have the flavor of grape bubblegum. Most protein drinks and their ilk make me gag, and I find this quite tolerable. A real kiddie flavor that reminds me of things like Kool Aid, Life Savers, and Tang."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been diagnosed with diverticulosis disease a few years ago. I then immediately started to take Metamucil to improve regularity. That product did improve my problem but not to my satisfaction. It produced a lot of gas, plus I did not like the taste. Additionally, it appeared to lose its effectiveness with time. Several months ago, a friend with the same problem told me that I should try this product called Konsyl. He said that it was much better than Metamucil. Man, my friend was SO right. This product is awesome. I use it twice daily (as opposed to 3 times for Metamucil) and it works as advertised. I first purchased it at Wallgreens but I recently found out that I can also buy it through Amazon. I highly recommend this product to anyone having regularity problems."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I purchased this product for post P90X workouts. I LOVE it! I got the Lemon Lime flavor and the taste is great. I recommend using a Blender Bottle. My boyfriend purchased one prior to purchasing this product and it works great for mixing this in water. It has a small whisk ball inside the bottle which allows you to quickly shake and mix. I also only put one scoop in. It says two scoops on the container but to save product I tested putting less and less in. I tried 1/2 a scoop but it was very watery. I assumed one scoop would allow for me to still get the results I want and be able to conserve the product. I find it works just as well as when I put in two scoops. If you are on the fence about purchasing this product, whether it be the taste or grittiness, I would say definitely buy this product. If the taste bothers you in the least, I find after my workouts I drink it so fast I wouldn't even notice the taste if it were bad."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Just love this tea. I had it for the first time at a restaurant and quickly found it in a grocery store. It is the perfect taste to me, and no matter now long it seeps (if I forget to take the bag out) it doesn't develop that bitter taste. It stands up well to milk or half and half, and is a lovely, well-rounded flavor. I've even been able to use the teabag again for a second (albeit weaker) cup. It IS more expensive, but I find that it is very much worth it. Perfect anytime, but a cup of Numi is really my favorite treat in the winter or after a cold rain."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've tried Luna bars in the past before, and wasn't impressed by the texture. I found several of the flavors rather dry and overly sweet. However, I revisited Luna bars due to a crazy sweet craving I was having, and decided to try Chocolate Raspberry. Yum, yum! This has to be the best tasting Luna bar that I've ever tried. It is very chocolatey with a nice sweet/tart bite of raspberry flavor."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"My friend Kevin and I are root beer connoisseurs. We must have tried over 50 different brands, some great, Salty Dog, many ok and a few horrid (who'd a thunk). Meanwhile, we found the Boylan's brand of delicious root beer and, angelic voices singing, Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer. Nuttin' like it. Never disappoints. Difficult to describe. Not too fruity, not a false red taste. Not root beer, not bitter, not overly sweet. A satisfying taste, a unique flavor found nowhere else. We immediately decided it was the champagne of root beer even though there's that sub-category of birch beer. I gotta try more birch beers but have yet to get my hands on a creamy red birch beer. There's undoubtedly some out there. Lemme at them. Meanwhile, for the last 6 or so years we've reveled in this beverage, happily purchasing it for about a buck fifty a bottle from one of two stores in town. Now I see neither store carries it any longer. A sad day. I'm hoping to find another retailer in San Diego who does. Meanwhile, I'm gonna order some from Amazon. Drink hearty me maties. Ain't nuttin' like it. Everyone we've turned on to it recognizes the high quality, special taste treat. Lovely."

It's been about a month since I started taking them, and I now need about 2 hours less sleep per night. I also have more energy during the day, and can concentrate better all day long.

I can't tell if this is helping or not but I'm going to continue to take it and see if it makes a difference.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I'm so glad I got this it makes nursing outdoor so much easy and comfortable. Going around Seoul Korea made it easy.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea has a wonderful taste. It is nearly impossible to find at grocery stores anymore, so had to buy online."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,3.0,"Basically, this is a powder mix for one of those caffeinated energy drinks.Based on the packaging, I was expecting something more akin to a protein powder. Kinda think, creamy, smooth, etc. WRONG! It has a strong sharp flavor just like an energy drink. Regardless, I slammed it down and now I have some pretty interesting jitters.I will not mix this with water again. It would go great with vodka. Definitely vodka. Not tequila, not rum. Vodka.Maybe I'll use it in home made ice cream too. That should be interesting.Did I say jitters?Yow"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"i first heard of unkers 3yrs ago and im telling you its the best stuff ever!i was using on mussles and seen where it was used for many other things.if you like ben gay or icy hot you going to love this better.unlike ben gay this unkers product holds the heat in and stays the same for 8 or 9 hours,unlike ben gay on for bout an 1hr or so.not only is unkers better then been gay unkers stays hot strong and smells good i think.gotta try it ppl good stuff"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,This works wonders for heat flashes. I just put it in my pillow case at night and I get a full nights sleep.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,I purchased this for my infant son's room and it is wonderful. It does a great job of drowning out outside noise when he's sleeping. The timing of my purchase was great as it was right before we left for vacation. The sleepmate machine was very easy to pack along in the suitcase so we could have it with us during our trip. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a white noise machine.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I haven't had the nerve to take any of these pills because they are huge! You're supposed to take two with an 8 oz. glass of water before each meal. I'm sure it will curb your appetite and make you feel full, but I wary about taking them."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Just received the Alive! Multi-Vitamin 90 count (without iron) in the mail yesterday, took one pill this morning before work and noticed that I had more energy which lead to better productivity! lol And I did not find the need to come home and take a nap as I usually do. YAY! I'm not sure how many I should take yet, per day, but we will see in a week or so."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,"This is practically useless when used to take the temperature on a baby.It requires for the baby to be very still while you -delicately- move a prove inside his/her hear and wait for the second set of beeps, that can be nearly impossible while your baby is squirming around. Short of putting the baby's head on a bench grip I don't know see how this thing can be practical."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,This is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It is unpleasantly flavored and chalky. I spit my first bite out and threw the rest in the trash.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,2.0,"This product is poorly constructed, requires patience and you don't have that with a baby crying. It doesn't heat to a temperature the baby would like, so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards. Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on. After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have never disliked an Optimum Nutrition product I've tried, and this one is no exception. The 300g package gives you roughly 60 servings (each serving = 1 tsp.) of flavorless glutamine powder that mixes easily and well with every beverage I've tried so far. I usually just put it in my post-workout shakes, and you basically don't even notice it's in there. The only thing I don't like is the smell, because evidently flavorless does not mean scentless. I use ON's flavorless creatine powder as well, and that one smells very slightly of lemon-lime. This stuff, on the other hand, smells oddly reminiscent of Utz sour cream & onion potato chips. I know that's bizarre, and it definitely doesn't taste anything like that, but that's the first thing that comes to mind when I get a whiff of the open container. In any case, if you aren't taking any glutamine, or are considering taking glutamine, this is a great, easy, and economical way to get it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"This Coffee is Amazing!!!!!, in the title it says ""Regular"", because is not the best of all, but is the First in the regular Type of Coffee.I am from Colombia, so i have tried great coffees, In Vietnam without a doubt is one of the best coffees in the world (If you have been there, you know what I'm talking about; I was there in april of 2010 and buy the BEST OF THE BEST (Weaser Coffee # 1 for 40USD (6 oz)) and this regular type for 6 USD (16oz); i run out of the second one an i was really worried that i cannot access to this incredible product... then I found it in Amazon and I ordered 4 of this.Ahhhh ordered with the Vietnam Coffee Maker and do it as the Vietnamise does... (Dont forget the condense milk)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been using Swedish Bitters for about five years. If I run out, I can tell the difference. For me, Swedish bitters improve energy, digestion and overall well-being."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,3.0,"I deducted one star for the ""pure vanilla powder"" name, and another for not being as aromatic as pure vanilla, so 3 stars. I read the description above and thought I scrutinized the wording well enough to detect any misdirection, so unfortunately I didn't get to the ingredients list. I have some Rodelle vanilla pods and the fragrance is amazing. Compared to any vanilla essence I've ever tried, it's like the difference between freshly roasted coffee beans and folgers. So I thought this ""pure vanilla powder"" would be the closest thing ([...] bucks for a little jar!), and easier to use than vanilla pods. Well it turns out it's a jar of essentially corn syrup solids laced with vanilla extract.It's hard to avoid maltodextrin in pre-processed foods from the supermarket, but I'd rather not have it in my homemade foods too. It's a good thing that there's a powder version on the market, because it has its own kind of convenience, but it doesn't seem to me any more fragrant than regular extract, and unlike other reviewers' experience it seem like I do have to use more than liquid extract (also it cakes up terribly). Might be worth $3.50+shipping for the added convenience of the powder, but otherwise it's a pretty pedestrian product. Win some, learn some..."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is possibly the best Jasmine Green tea i've ever had coming from a teabag. I'd rather drink this than what most chinese dim sum places would serve. It has a strong jasmine flavor compared to Bigelow and the flavor is more bold. I definitely recommend trying this if you're a fan of Jasmine Green tea.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,4.0,"I ordered Stacy's Pita Chips, Simply Naked, 1.5-Ounce Bag (Pack of 24) and 8 bags was broken,so I sent email to amazon about that and I never have answer.But the chips are very good and I`ll buy it again."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,I think the ice bandana is a good idea and the instructions and information given with it indicated that it would keep you cool or the ice wouldn't melt for 3 hours. Well I'm lucky if the ice bandana stays cool and not melted for 40 minutes. It's good for the first 15 minutes or so and then after that it is not much help.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Adagio herbal teas are some of the highest quality and best tasting products in existence. The Sour Apple is probably the one that is least like its name but is tasty nonetheless. Raspberry Patch, Pina Colada, Berry Blast, Blood Orange, Dewey Cherry, Mango Melange and Berry Blues all live up to their names and are simply delicious."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,Hi. I got this product for trigeminal neuralgia treatment of my mother. Until this moment it has reduced the pain in her face and she feels so happy. I recommend this product like a complement of neuralgia treatment. You could find more information in the next web page [...]
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,1.0,"This drink is not one of the best I have used. The taste is medicinal. I have better results energy and calorie burning wise with Celcius and VPX drinks. The Celcius available for really great value at Costco and the VPX, among many others, at Amazon, or Vitamin Shop. Blue Sky enters this market with a poor tasting product and hopes to overcome it's shortfall by claiming it is all natural. Too bad."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"A friend of mine first got me hooked on this when he had a sausage and cheese plate at a party. I have always liked ""Honeycup"" brand mustard, but it was a little bit too thick for my tastes. This was a great compromise, and has a really strong kick but isn't burning hot. I can go through a bottle a month, so it got expensive, but buying six like this cut a good percentage off of it. Great deal!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I promised I would write a review if the monitor helped me conceive. It worked the first time my husband and I TTC'ed. I am 33 with 29-35 day cycles. I used the monitor one month so it would get to know my cycle. Then the second month we actually tried when the monitor said peak fertility, and I got pregnant! It was really easy peeing on the sticks every morning and great knowing where you really where in your cycle. The charting technique seemed too much of a hassle, and this monitor does it for you. I am recommending it to everyone ready to have a baby."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Powder tastes good and mixes well. I supplement a banana - milk - yogurt shake with one scoop before I work out.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,Have had tasted alot of coffee but this one is without a doubt the best cup of joe I have had. looking foward to tasting other blends of this product as for this one it jump starts the taste buds hands down.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I am very pleased with my purchase. The price is amazing. I plan to make another purchase in the future. Thank you Amazon and Solaray.
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"I've been using the product for the past year or so now and it really works well for me. I can only speak for myself---it helps me with energy and appetite control---what more can I ask for in help with my weight loss attempts.Covaxil Laboratories Estrin-D, 90 Capsules"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I'm using this as a meal replacement in order to lose weight. This is the best tasting shake I've had and the nutritional content is better than others I've tried.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,1.0,"my old pill splitter lasted years but finally the blade was not so sharp so i ordered this one. big mistake, the plastic cover that comes over the blade (so you don't cut youself? who would?) broke after about 2 weeks of use, i had to pull it out and it still doesn't work well, i have to really slam the lid in order for the pill to split into to neat halfs, and the rubber bottom prevents me from putting the pill in easily. i really hate this pill splitter. i am going to look for a new one, and throw this one away. it is a piece of junk."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I am 50 years old and have had hemeroids most of my adult life. I have had them cut out over and over and was told that I should consider surgery if I had another episode. Well the next episode ocurred and I did not want to go the surgical route. I found this stuff on the internet and had one of the local grocery store pharmacys order it for me. It kept me from having surgery and it has bee about 5 years since I have had a problem. Today, I ordered some more as I am beginning to feel the symptoms for the first time since. It did not work all at once, but after about a day, I had tremendous relief and then no hemeroids until now. For me that is incredible. Get this stuff."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,This a wonderful glass jar. It is very easy to clean and is much easier to add and remove product because you don't have unscrew a lid so it makes it very accessible. It is perfect for flour and sugar-things you buy in the bulk as it holds a lot. Would recommend these jars to anyone. I also like it because you don't know what poisons you are getting from the plastic storage.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,1.0,"After an initial positive experience with the product, I ordered a second pack of 8. The first pouch we opened was fine, however the second was where we encountered a problem. The meat in the bottom of the package was covered in a thick nasty mold. I reached in and was about to take bite when I noticed the mold covering it! I'm guessing the seal must have somehow broke on the packaging? Just make sure you check before eating!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"I was looking for smaller width collars/nipples so you could actually USE the ""ready to feed"" bottles as they were intended, and actually found these disposable nipples second. I discovered that the spare bottle parts for my 'pump and feed' Medela bottles are actually the exact same size as these nipples!!!!! So to save the Planet some more trash, look in Amazon.com for ""MEDELA SPARE BOTTLE PARTS"". The kit you find has three nipples/collars/caps per $11 box. They work perfect and are reusable over the long term! Check it out!!!! If you need them for travel, a water rinse and a good wipe down with a pacifier wipe will work great in a pinch if you cant get to a kitchen/microwave before you run out. Happy feeding, and hope this helps!Medela Breastmilk Bottle Spare PartsThe First Years Pacifier WipesMedela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I have owned this little mister for 4-5 years now. I got my at GNC for $20.00. It diffuses the essential oils very well. I mix my own scents. It is a tad bit noisy, but changes colors and mists fine. It is a bit temperamental about the water level... If you add too much it won't mist, until you get the water level just right. But having this one for so long and using it practically everyday. It was an awesome little buy. Would definitely recommend this product. I clean it out everytime I re-use it. Just rise well and you will have no problems. Hope this helps you decide."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Item was as advertised, worked right out of box, Package good and fast shipping. Multiple setting are nice."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"This is a very smooth coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor and a hint of almonds. The flavors are not strong and the almond flavor is subtle. Overall, a very good coffee for those who do not like strong flavors. I would definitely buy this one again."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"This is the same product they use at my gyno's office. Worked well, no complaints at all..."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I work retail, I'm on my feet all day on concrete. I've tried many different insoles. The Spenco PolySorb Cross Trainers are the best for cushion on the heel and ball of the feet. They out-perform and out-last any other I've tried including ""gel"" insoles. These eliminate sore knees for me. I use these in any shoes I wear frequently. Highly recommended."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,This is a good product. Works as intended with no discernable side effects. Highly recommended.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,3.0,Just received the product today. The Accu-chek Aviva Control Solution is nowhere to be found. Will provide an update on how well the meter works.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"great product if you don't like horse pills but still want milligrams of a horse pill...watch out ordering from vitaminlife, they did not wrap my bottles individually and some were busted in transit..they did not reply to my complaints!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,I understand some people's frustration but this stuff really does work. If you have a big stubborn wart it's going to take longer. I was vigilent using the stick 3 to 4 times a day and when the wart would dry out I would file it down. At one point my wart was a little sore so I left it alone for a week and then started the process again. Now about 2 months later it is entirely gone. I also heard that Duct tape works the same way..(Of course I found this out later) Like to hear if this is true. Apparently you cut a piece to cover the wart for a few days. When the skin cells die you file it down and keep putting the duct tape on until the wart goes away.I'll have to try it if I ever get a wart again.Good Luck! :)
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,After 15 years of using this Emerita Pro-Gest Natural Progesterone Cream I have found that it does what it claims.It is a great stabilizer.My daughter who is now 45 years old is using it with great success in stabilizing her menstration period.Thanks for offering such an honest product that lives up to its purpose.G24
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I will say up front I have never had this product BUT PLEASE CONTINUE TO READ. I have a subscrition to Consumer Report and this protein shake is one of the healthiest on the market. I (up till today) udes to love Muscle Milk. Did you know that Muscle Milk actually has traces of lead, mercury and high levels of arsnic in it?Noy only does Solgar not have lead, mercury, cadmium but it also has the lowest of the reveiwed in arsnic(0.6 micrograms).This is by far the healthiest that consumer reports revied and sent to a lab for observing. Lets just say I will be switching."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"My husband and I decided to officially start trying to conceive in April of this year, and after reading all of the positive reviews, I bought this monitor. Coming off of the pill had made my cycles pretty irregular and I really didn't have any idea about when ovulation was happening. During the first month, the monitor was just getting to know my cycle, and I think our timing was a little bit off, so we didn't conceive. However, timing worked perfectly during the second month and now I am in my 12th week of pregnancy. The time window in the morning was never a problem, the monitor is easy to read, and though it can seem like an expensive investment, it seems like a such a small price to pay in exchange for quality, accuracy and the relief of knowing exactly what's happening with your cycle."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I had really bad bursitis in my elbow with significant swelling and this magnetic elbow support reduced the swelling almost overnight. After two weeks of use, my elbow is back to normal with no swelling. This support is amazing."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"We're from Western Maryland and these are our favorite pretzels -- we are never without a box or two in the house. We now live in Southern California, and we're delighted that they're available here. If they weren't, we would definitely be ordering them by the case! An added bonus is that they're low-fat, unlike so many other snacks."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,This compact and bright little light source can improve your mood and even help with depression and insomnia. I bought one for my wife and she swears by it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I recently bought this, not here but from a local store. I've yet to really figure out exactly how this compares, nutritionally, to some of the antioxidant juice drinks available, that cost so much more; assuming this extract is an antioxidant, however, there is the added plus that it's more affordable and very convenient to add to my seltzer water.There's no real 'taste' to it, maybe just a slight 'berry bite.' I have to say, I prefer not to taste it at all, so I dip a toothpick in essential oil (Di-Gize by Young Living) and stir it into my cup of seltzer and one-dropper-full of Herb Pharm Black Elderberry."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"I tried this product while deployed to Iraq. Being an African-American woman, our hair needs oil. This product conditioned my hair and I immediately noticed less or no breakage. My hair is in the best condition that it has been in years. I use it nightly and leave it in since my hair is very porous. It absorbs completely. This product was also excellent as a braid spray. I put it into a spray bottle and sprayed it on my scalp between the braids. No build up. I purchased many bottles prior to me redeploying back to the US. I highly recommend this product."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"The lice terminator comb is the tool to rid of the hair from these annoying pests. My daughter's hair was bug free by the third day! Since she has thick, wavy hair, I had to spray on leave-in conditioner and comb her hair thoroughly with a regular comb before using the terminator. It's a keeper."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"This is the second LightRelief machine I have purchased. I got this one for my 82 year old mother who is having pain in her knees and it has helped her already. I have used mine for years and it has completly stopped my shoulder pain and I use it on my back pain and because of this I can keep moving, the pain is gone. Easy to use and lasts. Excellent product and super price. Highly recommend."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have a skin condition known as KP, and this definitely helped in reducing the visibillity of it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Of course, this does have a 4g creatine blend.But, there are no calories or protein.So you would have to get your carbs/protein from some other supplement.If you tried NO-explode, you would know that when you mix your drink with water, you get a more homogenous mixture.But with Cellmass, you get ALOT of sediments in the bottom. (I mixed it and drank it RIGHT after, so it didnt just settle to the bottom).Overall, Id recommend something else."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"Unlike most all-natural foods that, in my opinion, tend to taste like tree bark, this one was not at all bad. However, since I tend to like bars for bigger servings of fiber vs servings of fruit and vegetables (I eat plenty of that stuff in fresh form) I still can't buy these over my favorite - Fiber One bars.That said, for what this product IS - and since most people don't eat nearly enough fruit in their diets - I liked it and would buy it again."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"This is a great cereal bar. Probably of the best that General Mills has ever made. There's just one problem though. You can no longer find them on the shelf of your local grocery store. But with the help of the internet, I was able to find a source to purchase them via Amazon. Thanks Amazon for providing a way for people to find and purchase items that can't be found otherwise."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,Maybe if I was stuck on a desert island and only had these to eat...then I would eat it again. I did not like the taste or the consistency.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"What else would you use three pounds of Vitamin C for? Unless you are cooking for a school or other group, you probably wont ever need this much. Especially because it has such a short half life once its opened.We use it to remove stains from our swimming pool. Its the same ingredient that is sold as a pool stain treatment, but its more econimical to buy it this way. And who knows, maybe a little C in the swimming pool is good for the swimmers."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"Didn't taste as good as I wanted, but still good considering the fact that it is only a healthier meal bar than a bag of chips!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,very tasty. Had to stir it in with milk slowly in order to avoid clumping.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This product is Awesome and Helpful for anyone with asthma and or breathing difficulties. I have dealt with for years and keep coming back to this item; because it seems to work so good with honey -and sometimes a drop or two of fresh lemon. I add chamomile tea bag with one of these at bed time; and it really works very good for my lungs seem to be eased. I do notice though that if the product is close to expiring it does not seem to be as effective-and would advise not buying anything near expired when it comes to all-nature products that probably don't have all that many additives or preservatives to begin with.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY. This item cannot be used by people with pacemakers. You only find this out after receiving the item and reading the warnings. The company would only accept the return if you pay to re-ship and a re-stocking fee. Even though there was no advance warning. Shipping fees to receive and return this item would be more than the cost of the item. Not worth it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've had IBS for a while and suffer from constipation. This is the only fiber that works well for me. And it not only works well it works great. It's such a relief to be so regular again. As far as the taste it's not great...but the issue for me more is the texture. I don't recommend mixing it in smoothies or yogurt because it absorbs water fast and becomes thick and gelatinous. I just put a scoop in a glass of water, stir well and chug. Not my favorite thing to do but it gets the job done.I can't recommend this enough though for constipation. It's even helped my heartburn quite a bit. Oh and buy online it's much cheaper than Vitamin Shoppe!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,I have been purchasing Nana's cookies for some time. They are healthy cookies. They also taste really good. They are a much better price at Amazon compared to the grocery stores.
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,It really works and it doesn't dry out your face. The step 2 can be a little stinging at first but the feeling goes away quickly. And I love that you don't have to apply it too often!
health personal care,health care,stimulants,5.0,"This caffeine gum may not taste the best in the world, although the taste does grow on you, but it works great when you need a boost. Personally, I prefer not to drink soda and I don't like coffee, so this gum is a life saver for me! It also comes in a couple other flavors, but I find that the flavor doesn't last as long in the spearmint and polar ice flavors. If you want a boost without the fluid, this gum works great."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,Small and filled with everything I need for a first aid kit in my car.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Even non-dieters love these. 1 box, made as per instructions (I use a 6oz container of nonfat vanilla yogurt usually) makes 1 pan, but I find that it makes a decently thick brownie if you use an 8x8 pan and adjust cooking time accordingly. I couldn't spread the whole batter out into a larger pan. The batter is very thick and when all you are adding to the box of powder mix is a small carton of yogurt, it seems unlikely that that small amount of yogurt will turn a bowl of powder into a bowl of batter but if you keep stirring, it does happen. I also tried it using nonfat plain Greek yogurt plus a tsp of vanilla but it was too thick so I had to add a few tablespoons of water and then the batter came out perfect and the brownies were just as great as always. I like that you can do single servings in a bowl in the microwave (I double these as they are pretty small). These brownies are not as gooey and flakey as a regular decadent type but they have more a thicker chewy-ness (like a crust but not hard or flaky) on the bottom and outside edges that some people prefer. For a nice treat, top these brownies with fat free Cool Whip and some sugar free chocolate syrup... diet brownie heaven. They sell this mix in my local supermarket and it's about $3-$5 depending on if there's a sale. These brownies are very sticky when cutting them so it's also good to make them in muffin tins instead of brownie pans."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"My two GF boys really love these bars. They taste just like cocoa krispie treats to me, so I have to limit the amount they get per day. They'd love to eat them morning noon and night! LOL.The price here at amazon is unbeatable, as far as I've seen. The subscribe and save is a lifesaver for us!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Of all the anti-acids taken over the years, the best is still Brioschi! It contains no aspirin, dissolves instantly in water and works really quick alleviating that uncomfortable bloated filling from over eating. Plus, it has a decent taste."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,This product works great for me and this is best price I have found anywhere.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"There are days when I can not get out of bed due the excruciating pain I have due to an autoimmune system. Not only are do these boots help to warm the muscles, the beautiful scent is soothing to senses. I love these!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This thing has not cured my trigger points but when they get acute this is the tool I go for first. After a few minutes of working the trigger points they usually relax and my pain level drops 2-3 points on the 1-10 scale.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"The people at Mustapha's took time and undeserved patience with me, with this product. Thanks!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,We love Beanpod candles and have ordered from many different companies and the last 4 do notburn like they are suppose to. The wax still remains about 1 inch around the inside of the glassand does not melt or give off the lemon smell. Are these old? Beanpod candles are the best and we have never had a problem with these candles? Will probably not order from this company again.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,This is great for a snack. Good flavor and texture. The only drawbacks for me are not enough protein to make it last and not enough fiber. It's simply a snack. Would probably work well for children for school lunches.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"Almost instant relief.Separate controls for heat and massage, so you only select what you need (or what you feel like). The automatic shutoff is a neccessity because you fall to sleep as it relieves the pain.The vibrator is not silent, but not irritating. In other words you can hear it, but you can hear the TV over it, or go to sleep. :)Bottom Line - for under $20 - great value! If it was over $50, I'd expect it to be quieter... but it's still more effective than fancy massages I've borrowed that cost $100 or more."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,I use them to spice up a lot of dishes. One of my favorites is as a stuffing for acorn squash. I buy them by the case and they're always in my pantry!

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,best product for diaper rash- too bad it is not main stream in the US
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Short Background:I have a immune disorder disease as well as psoriasis(dry skin patches). I found out that the psoriasis is made worse by a week immune system so I set forth to boost my immune system as much as possible. I found 9-yes 9 pills to help my immune system and was ready to buy and start taking them everyday (and I HATE taking pills). Thats when I came across the Miracle 2000.I was Very skeptical after reading the reviews due to the apparent nasty flavor of the product but since it already had the ingredients of the 9 pills I was about to start choking down along with MANY MANY more things I needed, I figured I would give it a try.TASTE= Horrid at first but now tollerable after 2 weeks of taking 1 capful a day.I will be totaly honest here. It looks and smells (to me) like a babys green diaper poo. I'm guessing the flavor would be somewhat close too, at least at first.I started out by trying to mix it with OJ-nasty, then fruit punch-nasty. For me, I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to ruin anymore drinks or prolong getting it down to the time it took to drink a whole glass of ""whatever"". I started pinching my nose, taking my capful straight, rinsing my mouth then drinking a strong flavored drink (tea for me)to get rid of the after taste. This whole process only took less than 30 seconds.I had decided not to whimp out so I could give it a fair shot to see if it works. After about 3 days, I did notice not being so tired and my lower back for some reason not hurting quit as bad. After a full week I have also noticed my skin condition getting better.After a week, I was tired of holding my nose when taking it and dared to just down a capful and drink afterwards. I was amazed that although I still don't care for the flavor it doesn't effect me anywhere near as bad as it did when I started. And now only takes like 15 seconds to take it and rinse it down.After 2 weeks I definately have more energy, seem to have less little aches than I did before and my skin is continuing to clear. I also have an overall feeling of feeling better which I love.THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH BUYING AND I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT IT AGAIN! It saved me from taking 9 different pills PLUS gave me extra benefits I wasn't looking for. Taste is definately something to get used to but WELL worth it."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"A great way to get freshly ground nutmeg without any bitter additives. It goes great over fresh asparagus. I think this small order will last for about a year, so it is a good buy."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"It took about two weeks, but I could definitely feel a difference. I'm much less bloated and seem to be more ""regular."""
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"I use this aioli to make fish smell less fishy, so my family will eat a variety of fish instead of just bland fish like tilapia. But this aioli would go well in a sandwich or as a thick salad dressing too. I want to learn to make my own aioli, but these jars are so much more convenient."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a unique product that actually tests your zinc levels while supplimenting. The taste of the liquid tells you how much you need, and the taste changes as your zinc levels increase. My doctor recommends this, but it is cheaper on Amazon than from her."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,We have tried a number of different Cajun seasoning and this blend is the best! Not too salty and the right amount of heat.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"This product has helped quite a bit. There still is some pain, but have gotten some relief."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola trail mix bars,5.0,"Even to this day, I look on the store shelves to see if the Lemon Nature Valley Granola Bars are back. They were the absolute best! I discovered them while I was on Weight Watchers; they were just the perfect WW snack. Now, Nature Valley isn't making them anymore, but WW does have a similar bar now, with the lemon flavor. Usually, you can only get them at a Weight Watchers Center. Still miss those Nature Valley Lemon ones, though!! Please bring them back!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I have been using the Power Punch flavor for about three months. I drink 3/4ths of it during the drive to the gym and it really gives me the energy and endurance to get a great workout. On days I workout without it, I really notice the difference."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I have ordered this product before and I had good service. I have not received this shipment. It has been about 18 days since it was shipped. I have had to order early because I don't know how to contact the seller and let him know of my problem.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,I have been around the fitness world for a long time now and always try new protein powders just to see what the best fit is for me. I finnaly found it. This whey tastes good and absorbs fast. I feel lifted the second after I take it. I highly recommend Elite Whey. Do the research!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"I am personally so sick of mango and the fact that it is still a trendy fruit makes me crazy. However, we tried this recently after letting it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of months unopened. My girlfriend thought it would be great but I never relented because it just sounded terrible to me.I could not have been more wrong. When her sister came over for dinner they broke it out despite my pleas to the contrary and used it on the barbecued chicken. It was really, really good. I'm such a baby about trying new things especially when they are made with ingredients I typically do not like but this was really a pleasant surprise. I won't say I'll use it all the time but I won't protest if she makes chicken with it again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"While I have had mint teas before, I have not had one that was as good and flavorful as this one. I happened to stumble upon this tea when I logged in to re-order the tea I previously purchased (jasmine gree tea). The reviews made this tea sound awesome so I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I am so glad I did. This tea is very flavorful. You do not need to add any sugar when drinking this tea. I also like the fact that it is organic."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,I thought this bread was pretty good overall. The only problem I had is that it rises VERY high. I now make two loaves out of the one mix so that it doesnt get so high (if it gets too high it will collapse).
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"This is one of the biggest pieces of junk. Worked fine for a couple of months, then would start randomly cutting out. I'm someone that's grown up with sound machines helping get to sleep and stay asleep, so I've gotten to the point that if everything goes quiet in my room I will immediately wake up. This machine has cut out more and more over the last year and now I can't even get it to connect to the power cord anymore so I have to keep batteries in it at all times. I'll turn it on and turn the knob for the volume, something that should be a relatively easy task, and it will cut in and out, in and out. And a lot of the time it won't even come on at all, even if I've just replaced the batteries. It's awful. Spend some more money on a machine that actually works. You'll be glad you did."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"The tea didn't make me drowsy in the slightest and tasted nasty. I've barely had tea in my life, so I checked to make sure I was doing it right the second time, including adding a second bag of tea to see if I just had low sensitivity, but still nothing happened, and it just tasted nastier. Judging by the other reviews, I guess I'm unlucky?"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have tried many types of pollen, needed to find one with the best taste that my kids would approve of. This one definitely wins hands down! Other types are hard, dried, and very ""earthy"" tasting. This pollen is what you would expect the nectar of flowers to taste like... sweet...with a melt in your mouth freshness. I've tried Y.S. Organic and does not come close to this quality, in my opinion. The organic variety sold at Mountain Rose Herbs does not taste good to us either. The fact that this comes from wild flowers in the desert, makes it even better than ""organic"". This is the one to buy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"It's not ""gold plated"". It's too expensive for 2 oz. They want almost $10.00 for shipping to boot! I bought 6 oz., 3 times that amount for less than what they want for 2 oz from Swanson's, and they charge $5.00 for shipping total for all you want to buy on your order."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,I wanted a 12 volt battery pack so it would be more powerful. This is only a 9 volt battery pack. I wish I knew.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"This is a good recovery and supplemental drink. However, it is a little too sweet for me. Therefore, I have to reduce the number of scoops per serving and that cuts into the amount of protein intended."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I never liked teas before untill i tried this one, a friend brought it from Israel to Costa Rica, the fruit flavors are awesome, i've bought 5 of them online since i can't find this brand in my country. I do not enjoy herbal teas yet however i tried the mint tea and liked it very much, the smell of mint is so strong, delicious."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A REVIEW SINCE I HAVEN'T PURCHASED THE PRODUCT YET.You have no idea how happy & excited I am that BFI is still being manufactured & is available on Amazon.com. BFI was my mother's go to for almost everything, cuts & scrapes etc. When she died 17 years ago, I found the container in her medicine cabinet. I took it home as a memory & each time I see it, I think of her. I never used it since i thought that it wouldn't work since it was more than 17 years old. It's funny, when I got married many years before she died, I never thought of buying BFI powder for our home since I had used it when l lived with my parents. Maybe it was my desire to create my own go to product. I guess mother knew best.'"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,Love this- got it as a baby shower gift and use it everyday. We don't have a dishwasher and don't want to put baby stuff with regular dishes. (Want to find it fast). All the little spokes make drying and finding what you need fast.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Found a bottle of these in my medicine cabinet from a few years ago... omg I had forgotten how incredibly well they work. I had been taking prescription medications for my leg and lower back cramps; two of these tablets, sublingual, work INSTANTLY and relieve the cramping better than any of the Rx's. I don't know how they work... I just know they do, like magic. Thanks Hyland's."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,Spend the extra $10-$15 and get a Medela!!!! I have used both and the Medela is way better. This one is awkward to use. You need both hands to use it effectively. Very disappointed. Go with Medela's manual pump if you can't afford an electric. Buy an electric if you can it is so worth it. (Lansinoh pump worked awesome for me)
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I like this product. Helps a lot with sleep. As for recovery, I really didn't notice a big difference. Only thing I don't like about it is that it makes me break out, but other than that it's an awesome product."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I love these bottles. I'm a working mom who is trying to breastfeed. My daughter has not got nipple confusion yet and doesn't seem to have a problem with gas from these bottles.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I really enjoy sitting down and eatting a good meal. But I can get the worst gas! I mean, it's like a government Mule! and Burn your eyes and stain your white shirt! Wooooooooowee! Let's just say,it aint good.But I take these pills now and have found relief. Those around me keep me supplied, and the wife has let me move back in. My dog is even starting to play with again. Thanks Charcoal!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"For fun, I went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about 2 dozen different protein/nutritio bars. My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon. It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible. There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.The Go Raw Live Pumpkin Bar is full of yummy crunchy nuttiness. I loved the taste and texture of it, just bursting with pumpkin seed flavor and lightly sweetened.It has more calories than any other bar I tried - 276. But it also comes with 14g of protein, 8g of fiber, and 18g of healthy fats. It's the kind of bar that's going to leave you satisfied for a long time. I will definitely get these again."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"Four HUNDRED generic Benadryl for six bucks and change?? Was there ever a better value?Benadryl is like one of safest, and most optimum drugs you can take. Can't sleep? Are you itchy? Generic benadryl (works just like the pricey stuff) can put you gently to sleep, and stop any miscellaneous itching you've got.And guess what? it works GREAT on dogs. You know how your dog starts itching right around the time you get allergy problems? You can give a dog benadryl and maybe save yourself a vet visit. The trick is to get the itching before it gets so bad the dog develops hot spots. (Google benadryl and dogs, and you'll find the dosing charts.)Back to our canine friends"

It seems pretty straight forward.Just read the directions."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"I agree with people who don't like the new formula. I had a terrible experience with it. It does taste awful as others have said, and after two weeks my throat and esophagus began to burn badly. I also began to feel very anxious on it.More disturbing was that I began to have what felt like a very irregular hearbeat. When I would walk anywhere it felt like my heart was leaping around in my chest and I felt short of breath. I got so scared I went in for an EKG, which was normal.It finally occurred to me that these feelings might be caused by the burning effects of the new formula so I stopped taking it and everything returned to normal.I am so disappointed in this because I loved the old formula."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,dinners,5.0,My granddaughter is a very picky eater but loves this product. Put it in the microwave and its ready in just a few minutes and doesn't need to be refrigerated. It's great when traveling. Highly recommend.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,i have done days of research on ALL the combination formulas out there. It is a little pricey but it does have the biggest bang for your buck and it is the most complete. you do have to take several pills threw out the day for maximum results.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I tried to use the 'real' apple cider vinegar and hated it. I could smell it all night long and the taste was awful. While browsing the internet, I found these tablets and since my daughter uses the real vinegar, we compared notes and I truly can't see any difference except that this is so much easier to use. So far, I have lost eight pounds without much effort."

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"I am NOT impressed with the quality of this machine. After less than 6 months it is turning off intermittently for no apparent reason--it's not the cord coming out, it's not our electricity.It's unpredictable when it will turn off and has ruined more than one nap for my twins by turning off just at a crucial time. Driving me crazy and I am so annoyed at the quality. DO NOT BUY. Get another brand--the idea is great but the quality of this machine is just horrible."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,fruit,5.0,"My daughter loves this one - sweet (not bitter), great texture....get on subscribe and save - well worth the deal!!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"TR will attract people who do not know how melatonin works. It does NOT keep you asleep all night, requiring time release. In you body it is released in a flood to get you ready to sleep and will help you GET to sleep. But it does not KEEP you asleep. Using TR is counter-productive.Also, be sure to never take melatonin during the day. It will actually harm your body if you take it while it still light out. It is NOT a sleep drug that will just put you to sleep anytime."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,This bar gets smaller and smaller and smaller; it's almost a joke.It would be interesting to see the OZ per bar when they first marketed compared to now. They do a great job of hiding the product size and making it seem insignificant.Strategy
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,Love the taste and that it is good for me. Very well priced. The package came with no damage. I order a pack of 8 at a time. Will definitely buy again.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Switched from fish oil to krill oil on my doctor's recommendation. Source Naturals seems to be a good product and it is reasonably priced. jp in Mississippi.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"Perfect for those lazy nights. My boyfriend, who is Italian and likes authentic Italian food (the food snob), really loves this. And honestly, it's so hard to mess the dish up. I've put more water than necessary, left it on for longer than necessary, and both times it was absolutely perfect."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I love Splenda!It works great for any type of sweetening or baking and no one is the wiser, including my taste buds! There is no odd after taste that a lot of other substitutes have either.Although, some people may complain of the 24 carbs that are in one full cup of Splenda, it is not really that big of a deal. Think about it, if a low-carb cheese cake recipe calls for 1 and 1/3 cup of Splenda, that is a little over 30 grams of carbs, right? Now, that sounds like a lot but, are you really going to eat the entire cheesecake by yourself? Also, compared to a cheesecake baked with pure white sugar, you are saving a ton of calories and carbs!Amazon also has a good price for Splenda compared to the grocery store. For anyone trying to cut back on sugar, but want to still have some indulgences here and there, Splenda sweetens the dieting deal. :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I highly recommend this as my favorite pre-workout mix. It gives me the energy to hit the gym as hard as I can for upwards of two hours, something I could have done without the mix, but would have been blown out half way through the work out. This mix also gives greats pumps and combined with the right exercises will make your arms feel like they're going to xplode. Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to take their workout to the next level or has those lazy days where you need some extra energy to get you started. I would suggest eating a power bar or something an hour before taking this because I've heard of people having a weird feeling in their stomach but most of them take it on a completely empty stomach which is very easy to upset in general."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I have been looking for a perfect spoon for my 8 month old baby, as some are to wide or too flat or too deep, this is perfect for us. It is deep enough to hold the food in it without spilling, but not too wide or flat and the case closes and opens easily, which is what I was worried about before opening the package. The fork we have not tried yet, so I can't comment in it. It is only 5 bucks at babiesrus so it is a great deal I think."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"I bought these spoons for my 13 month old when she began reaching for our silverware at dinnertime. These spoons are short and thick-handled, and perfect for little hands. The only drawbacks that I have seen in a few months of use are that the white plastic tends to stain, like most white/clear plastic, its going to get stained with spaghetti sauce, and the spoon is a bit shallow to ""scoop"" something up. But all in all, am very happy with these and we have bought two more sets."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,I purchased this item because I had previously purchased the larger bag of mixed chips. I love these because they are low sodium and really taste like sweet potatoes. It's nice to find a really good healthy and tasty alternative to the high-sodium snack items in the marketplace.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"Just as all the other reviewers have said--this is an amazing product, juicy, fresh, flavorful, and such a good deal. I plan to buy the 54-pack of vanilla beans next--these are quickly growing to be an essential part of my kitchen. Love!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"They were highly recommended to me by my doctor. He knew what he was talking about. They have no taste whatsoever, keep my joints in good working order, my skin supple, and I have great hopes that my brain is soaking up all of the good things these gel capsules contain. I also don't worry about the oil containing any toxic material."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've tried many different kinds of GABA supplements and I prefer this one, along with GABA Calm sublingual, by far.Theanine is excellent paired with GABA for it's calming effects, they are two of the best supplements for social anxiety. Theanine is an amino acid like compound found almost exclusively in the the tea plant, it increases the production of calming brain waves and inhibits the stimulatory properties of caffeine. If theanine and caffeine are combined it stimulates a person mentally, like a natural Adderall of sorts."

Something in the 'sucking' function let go and that's all she wrote.After trying to contact service via telephone with negative results and because I live local, I decided to drive over to the business address only to be given the 'run around' as well.Don't waste your money or time. Get something else."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Too white. It can be rubbed in so it's not real bad, but you may not have a mirror whenever you want to reapply so you could make yourself look really goofy. It is also very soft so it is hard not to use a lot more than you need. If you waste half or more of the product, it is essentially much more expensive than its already high price."

health personal care,health care,foot care,3.0,"I had the original Tuli's back in the day and found them much more comfortable than these. These are much bulkier and really take up some space in your shoes. The backs fold over and cause pinch points and dramatically raise your heel. I would recommend these if you KNOW you need more support and are about to buy new shoes, that way you can try them on with the new shoes you are thinking of buying instead of adding them to your current shoes. The only reason I didn't return them is it would cost more to return them then what I paid for them. I would however recommend the original Tuli's if you are planning on adding them to your current shoes, that's what I am going to do."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"My kid hates these! I tried quite a few times to get her to eat them... She's 18 months and not a picky eater at all. She loves variety in her food and lots of different flavors. We chose these because we didn't want to confuse ""gummy vitamins"" w/ candy i.e. ""gummy bears"". Well, after finally giving up on her ever taking these... I decided I would use them. OMG!, they are horrible. They have a gritty chalky bizarre fruity flavor and I now understand why she wouldn't even entertain consuming these. Please save your money, these vitamins are just plain gross. I'm still searching for the perfect kid vitamin."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Guayaki Mate Chocolatte is an absolutely wonderful blend! The tea is aromatic and has a mediumish body. The cocoa and spices are blended perfectly... neither overpowers one or another, yet both are prominent and easy to pick up on. The mate is more subtle, however, yet still present. Connoisseurs of mate tea, however, may find this to their disliking, due to how the mate itself is almost in the background.All-in-all, this mate blend is perfect for people new to mate teas, or for a connoisseur of mate who doesn't mind the subtle taste of the mate itself. In my opinion, this mate is best served the morning or as a dessert tea. I recommend serving the tea with no milk and with a teaspoon of sugar, as the sugar helps bring out the chocolate and adds a wonderful layer of complexity."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"My doctor recommened 2 brands for my osteoarthritis, this being one of them. It really does work for me, without it my fingers would be throbbing with pain and i would not be typing this review. I still need to take an occasional anti-inflammatory, but Osteo Biflex have really made a difference in my life."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I learned about this product years ago when a customer and I decided to exchange formula's..I sent a teathat helped greatly with a cold but when I received Unkers which is for sore joints , muscles, tendons , ..colds, etc.I couldn't believe how wonderful this product is...I've told everyone at my current job about it and they all have a jar andswear by it...One co worker said that this was the only product that helped her when she had Chemo..that's quite a claim.My husband recently had knee replacement and was in alot of pain..He used a whole jar of Unkers because it helped ease thepain considerably."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I have owned one of these in the past and they worked great. HOWEVER!, this one doesn't even work on medium or low, and the high setting barely gives enough heat that the low should have! Maybe during shipping, packing, storage, manufactoring, I'm not sure where. All I know is it is obvious that it is new as stated, but defective!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,trail mix,5.0,"These are really a great snack and the pouch size is perfect to share. Everyone I have had try them, loves them! Not too sweet, just enough for when you have that craving."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,So I bought this tea thinking it was the same as the Thai tea that is served at Thai Restaraunts but its not. This tea is very coconutty which theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same restaraunt type if thats what youre looking for. You should buy this tea if youre looking for a cinnamon/coconut exotic tea.
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"Love this Tea Tree Oil Soap. My son takes a lot of serious seizure meds and went through aggressive chemotherapy for testicular cancer two years ago. I believe both of these issues are the reason he is having so much trouble with his skin, hair and nails. It is likely that his natural immunity to minor bacterium and fungus has been compromised. He uses tea tree oil soap once/day now, every day and I believe it helps a lot and makes his skin just feel good. We're hooked."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"If your problem really is getting to sleep, this is the real deal. But be careful. The valerian really adds a kick to their regular Melatonin with Theanine. It leaves me with a bit of a dull hangover the next morning until my second cup of coffee. If all you need is a little help, I'd go with the Melatonin with Theanine. If you have real trouble getting to sleep, like I do on Sunday nights. This is the answer. Just don't expect to feel all bright and chipper in the morning."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love Genmaicha but don't have the time to brew loose tea. Choice Organic gives me the tea that I love with the convenience of tea bags at a great price. Amazon provides an economical shipping rate with a fast delivery. It showed up at my doorstep in just a few days. So all in all, this has been a great purchase. I'm not a purist so I drink it with a little Splenda but it's just as tasty as the restaurants."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This product was recommended to me by both my midwife and the lactation consultants at my hospital's breastfeeding clinic.On the days I would drink this, I was able to notice a difference in the amount of milk produced while pumping at work. I struggled with production, and would usually be able to pump 9 or 10 ounces instead of 7 or 8. I imagine if you produce more overall, you would hopefully see a similar increase percentage wise.A few things to note that are not on the box:You can make a large batch in the beginning of the day, and then drink throughout the day, either by reheating or chilled, and it will not lose it's potency...same with being able to mix with other teas once brewed if you find the taste undesirable. Since it is imperative that you follow the brewing directions that require seeping, while covered for ten minutes, these are a few tips the lactation clinic suggested to make sure it was easier to fit into my day as a working professional."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"This coffee is fine, if you like average. But, both my husband and I like a rich bold taste without bitterness. We adore the flavor of the Carmel Kiss in particular. If you want a nice smooth cup of coffee with just a hint of toffee, this is for you."

He will never hike without these items again."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"I have found these pill boxes to be a great help when organizing our weekly drugs etc., the only peeve I had with this order was the being only able to order 3 boxes. I don't understand why you would do this, it certainly has been an inconvenience to me."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands. In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon. I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands. I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong. Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter. An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices. I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one. Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,Ok this coconut oil smells like alot of butter than coconut oil. I was expecting a fresh coconut oil smell like a tropical island smell this is not it. My mother and my sister do not like the smell at all but coconut oil is suppose to be really good on your body and I would really like to use it but I cant stand the smell. Did I get a bad batch because everyone on here thinks its smells sooooooooooooo good Im not gettting that at all..... is there any other brand?
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I am in a lot of pain due to plantar fasciitis. The podiatrist tried to sell me the exact same insole for $10 more than the price on amazon. The arch support is really good because the arch area is very stiff on the insole. I can actually feel the arch support with these things in my shoes. Never felt that with any of the dr. scholls insoles I tried, and I tried a lot of them."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I'm not sure why some of the reviews for this are so whiny. This stuff mixes pretty well, tastes ok, and is very inexpensive. I also like that it has stevia and no artificial sweeteners. What more could you want?"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"When I first started to see my hairline recede it was receding at a fairly rapid pace. Ever since I started taking saw palmetto (not just this brand, but others as well) my recession of hair has came to a crawl or stopped altogether. I was also hoping that it would help with my bladder weakness, but I haven't seen much or any improvement. Maybe I'm not taking enough as I take 3-4 a day while the bottle says to take 6 a day for intensive use. Another thing I should point out is that maybe I don't have a weak bladder and that maybe I'm always going is because I drink HELLA water...more water and fluids than anyone I know. Hope this helps."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I've taken Appearex Biotin Tablets for 2 months now and my nails have improved so much. Before I had ridges and vertical splits on 3 nails...the splits have disappeared. Still have ridges on one nail. The peeling has stopped completely. I guess I'll be taking this forever. Don't want to go back to the way my nails were.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I had very painful fibroids in my breasts. I didn't want anyone within 2 feet of me for fear they may brush against me! Within 3 weeks of taking this (I only took half the dose) the pain was entirely gone and has not returned 1.5 years later. I am thrilled with this product!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,This by far is the best barbecue sauce I have ever tasted. I'm eating some BBQ ribs right now as I'm typing. I'm getting sauce all over myself. I'm getting barbecue sauce on the keyboard. Holy smoke! And this is just the regular flavor. I can't wait to try the honey flavored!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I have used this brand for well over a year now and have found it to be very durable.I've read bad reviews of this product, but it has worked wonderfully for me.It is much better for me than the ones you have to boil and mold. I used those kinds for several years before finding this one.Those boil to fit types are much more bulky and not as comfortable as this night guard.Even though I think this product could possibly use a bit of tweaking in the front to fit my gum area better, it is so much nicer than the others that I can't really complain.I would highly recommend that anyone with a night grinding problem at least give this a try. It is a bit more expensive, but well worth it! I can even talk to my husband with it in, which I could never do with the other type!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I live in Mississippi and am diabetic. The cinnamon in this tea not only helps control my blood sugar but it makes the tea so sweet I don't need sugar or any other kind of sweetener. The only place where carries this tea here is a organic grocery store which sells it for twice the amount I can get it here for.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,1.0,I was disapointed with pill organizer. I had only used it one time when the lids started falling off. I would have contacted the seller but when it happened I was no where near my computer so I just let it slide. I don't think I will be buying anything else from this company again.

health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,"This item did not work at all the shampoo did not kill the live bugs and comb did nothing for my daughters hair. I have found the only thing that gets eggs out is pulling them out one by one with your finger nails. Lice are horrible. I have tried to find out how to return this item and e-mailed the seller and no reply, very disappointing.I also ordered pink spray and got white spray and that does nothing for blond hair. I will say they do ship quickly."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I am partial to the Familia Swiss brand for my museli, but this is my favorite crunchy style. I prefer to have the nuts in the mix and add my own fruit as seasonally available. Freeze dried fruit is just never as good."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,crackers biscuits,5.0,"I don't care where in the world these are made! China, Mexico, India, Yugoslavia, I don't care! Put my 8 month old son in his car seat and hear his instant high pitch screams that seem to never end while running errands is the worst! I watch carefully what he eats organic everything. Even his cookies and teether's that come from Whole Foods at a Whole Bunch of money can't do the trick! Not to mention how incredibly messy they get. I found these at Walmart. I got a box and wished I had bought a case since the closes Walmart is 40 minutes away. Instant happiness for the both of us. They melt in his mouth almost instantly so no worrying about choking while driving. The ingredients are very simple and taste good too. I would know my son likes to share.On a side note. I just found out that my local Babies R Us now stocks these wonderful China made husk! So stocking up! Sometimes you just have to go with what works."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"I take exception to the holes being poked in the bag prior to shipping. Now I have 6 bags with holes in them. A good entry for bugs. Why can't they just fill the bags without air in them like other flour companies do?The first attempt at making this bread in my bread machine was a failure. I use a Zojirushi bread machine, maybe that's the problem. I'll have to research other machines that might be better for the gluten-free products.My second bread attempt had better results. Followed the directions for oven baking and it came out OK. It looked fantastic when it came out, nice & high but it didn't take long to deflate. The taste and texture is just OK so I still haven't found a delicious gluten free bread mix that I can say I love."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I bought this candle after I was told that these were the best smelling and stronger than yankee candles. I have to say, I can barely smell this candle at all. I am VERY disappointed in this purchase. I got the Pumpkin Pie scented one."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"My son is 2 and he still uses it. We have a small house so saving space is a must and I was MORE than happy to trade in the high chair for this. It's very easy to clean and use and he seems very comfortable in it. I will mention that the listing says it's blue, green, and gray. Mine is blue, green, and white. I did order it over a year ago, so it's possible it may be different now. In any case, I highly recommended it!!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Have you ever found yourself leaning onto a blunt object, such as a corner of the wall, in the attempt to work out a knot in your shoulder/back? Have you ever asked someone to push their knuckle on that same spot as hard as they can? If so, this item is a MUST! The original thero-cane is great, but this S shaped trigger point releiver gives you a few more options. The smaller curve has a round knob on the end, whereas the larger curve has a little more pointer knob for a different pressure point experience. The great thing about having this available is that you control how the amount of pressure you apply to your trouble spot and the size allows you to reach any area in need of attention. You won't have to beg a friend/family member to lean on your back and insisting they can lean harder...with this, you have control and can keep the pressure for as long as you feel necessary. Don't hesitate, just buy it, it's worth the money...your back will thank you! The only negative for this is if you travel a lot (and travel light), it's oddly shaped so fitting it into your carry-on would probably be impossible...but it would fit in a regular sized suitcase."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is good tasting product. There is no smell or no bad after test. Highly recommended.However, the sweetner is way too sweet and if you don't like too sweet, you may not like it.I think it is tolerable since it provide good amount of protein."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I am visually impaired and this mask has been a godsend. The construction is simple (foam with a glued on plastic) but when I am having trouble with light sensitivity I can place the mask on and still get things done around the house. I have blind center training as a fully blind person and so I can function reasonably well with no sight.This is a bit uncomfortable for sleeping in, but still worth the money."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I suffered a persistent ulcer from stress for over two years. Tried drinking cabbage juice and eating broccoli, which helped, but cabbage juice is disgusting and it takes a gallon of it daily, yuck. Then I tried these pills, basically the equivalent of about a quart or more of cabbage juice each I believe, but way cheaper. They smell like cabbage. In a few days I was symptom free after years of pain. Very impressive."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I've taken to making cupcakes and cookies and making icing letters on them... you know, an ""H"" on one cookie, ""A"" on another, and so forth, and arrange the cookies or cupcakes to spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY or whatever the occasion might be. I prefer bold, rich colors, like jewel tone colors, so these gel colors fit the bill to get the bold color without watering down my icing. Only takes a few toothpicks of color to get what I'm looking for, so each 1/2 ounce color is going to go a long way. A good buy, all around. I will never go back to regular liquid food coloring!Also, I know others have stated this but I'll say it again, the black color is good but you have to start with a chocolate icing, not a white icing.**Update** I found another use for these Wilton colors by making colored sugar. I've used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar (bigger crystals) and it works great either way, but the sparkling sugar is more, well, ""sparkly"" which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with. Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag, take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it, then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag. (Does that make sense?) Zip up the bag, then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed. The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar. Then spread the sugar out on a plate or a sheet of foil to dry for a few hours. Voila!"

They must be cooked a little longer, to be sure, and fussed over a tad more.For the modicum of extra effort required, receive a plate / bowl of tasty Italian. Add some good sauce and a few steamed veggies, and you have a fettuccine primavera worthy of any restaurant."

There is one for each day of the week.They are small but not too small for all the pills & so easy to take with you for the day if you have to be away from home.With space to put pills morning, noon, evening, & night, you never forget which pills to take at the right time."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,"Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. Maybe the other flavors are better, but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $1+ a bar."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Today is just my second day taking this little miracle pill, and I've had no problems. I started working out about three weeks ago, but I haven't been able to shake this sluggish feeling. I would wake up exhausted, (which didn't help during my work day). At night, I could barely keep my eyes open. I purchased these vitamins from Publix just to see if they could help me make through the day. My energy improved tremendously. In reading the reviews, it appears everyone has experienced nausea. I would highly recommending eating with these vitamins and also be sure to read the ingredients. I made the mistake of taking a multi-vitamin on an empty stomach and ended up feeling terrible for the remainder of the day. I didn't want to give 5 stars just yet, since I've just started, but I will update. Also if you're taking any medications, double-check with your doctor."

health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,I really like this item and it really helps to relieve the pain but you have to get used to it. It also takes a little figuring out to put it on.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I just bought this one at WF. It is small tablet and easy to swallow. I'm taking it with Orange Juice. So far I think it is working great. I don't feel out of breath anymore.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"If you're as anxious and analytical as I am you'll likely pick up patterns in most of these sounds. If you listen carefully, you can detect where the sound loops. I think it's about 10-15 seconds long. Once you hear that the sound becomes more annoying than no sound. HOWEVER... the waterfall sound is excellent. It's too white-noisy to be able to detect any pattern, so I can rest without 'hearing' it. So with that caveat, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who likes white noise to sleep or drown out something else."

She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous."

So I dont really know how this product works yet."

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"I bought this in the Dahlia print. It's definitely cute and covers the eyes well. The fabric is smooth, and you really can open your eyes without brushing your eyelashes on the inside. There's a little space where light can show through around the nose, but that can be fixed with a little arranging. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because of the elastic. It's just a little too short, so the velcro on the back is exposed.After I had bought this first mask, I ordered three more at Christmas last year - one for my sister, one for my husband, and an extra for me. The first mask was just for travel and only used occasionally in bed. I'm not sure if frequent use caused the new ones to fall apart, but they did. My husband's lasted about two months with nap-time use, then the edges just disintegrated and the layers frayed badly. Mine lasted about six months and then frayed a little bit. I don't know why they fell apart. I was hugely disappointed since the first one lasted so well."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,I use this product on the ends of my hearing aids that is inserted into the ear to stop the itchy feeling you get because the hairs are course in there. This softens the hairs and stops the itchy feeling. I have tried others but this one is the best and is resonably prices. A bottle lasts me almost 2 years and I use it daily. Shipping was very fast. I had the product in about 4 days. Good email communication too.

These are what they started him on in the hospital and although they are supposed to be disposable, we have been able to use nothing else since (despite numerous purchases of other brands to try with him.)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I have ordered several jars of this brand. The powder in the first jar was off-white and the consistency of flour. The subsequent jars contained a powder which was yellowish in color and had a consistency more like cornmeal. I sent one jar back, thinking the product was old. However, when I reordered, the jar I received contained the same type of powder.The smaller jars I have bought in the store contain the off-white, flour-like powder. I'm not sure if the problem with the powder in the larger jars results from the powder being older, or is a result of inconsistency in the manufacturing process. I wonder about the processing of the colostrum, given the inconsistency in the powder from jar to jar.I won't buy any of this brand in the larger jars for this reason. I am hoping to find another brand which is more consistent."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I cant speak to Cystex's ability to prevent UTIs, as I dont use it as a preventitive (which is why i only gave it 4 stars-maybe that wasnt fair, but, oh well), but when you need really fast relief of UTI symptoms, definately go with this product! Azo cranberry is great as a preventative measure, and that is what I use to prevent infections. But when I stop taking it for a long time, and get a UTI, Azo's pain reliever does not relieve the pain as quickly as Cystex does. It works really really fast! I cant remember exactly how long it took, but it was definately somewhere around 20 minutes."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love this tea! I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong. Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one. That's why I came here to subscribe to it.Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift. I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life. That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better! I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea. Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect. Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool). Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link). [...]Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea. I just may discover flavors unexperienced! Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list. Simply put, it hits the spot. Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices. With the addition of the ""subscribe & save"" option, this is an especially good deal."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews. But there are some more important changes you need to know about.First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g). They have also added 50mg of calcium.One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Sepp&auml;nen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels. All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"I consider myself to be a bit of an expert when it comes to pregnancy tests--I've taken far too many in the last 7 years of trying to get pregnant. I've seen a few positives and too many negatives in that time. The ""analog"" ones with the two lines or the +/- drive me crazy. I've been known to stare at it for what seems like hours trying too see if there is a line or not. I've pulled them out of the trash to double-check (a big no-no since you should only look at them within a certain time frame or shadow lines appear). The +/- are the worst--they gave faint false positives on every one of them for me.I am a fan of anything that keeps me from obsessing. That is what I love about the digital tests...no guessing, no obsessing if there is a line or not. It is either ""Not Pregnant"" or ""Pregnant.""I am a prime candidate for a false positive. I did IVF and took an Hcg shot before the retrieval. I also am impatient and never wait a full two weeks to take a pregnancy test. The hcg should have been out of my system within 10 days, but it can take a little longer to flush through the system. I took my first test at 11dpo (4 days before expected period - 51% accuracy according to the box) and it popped up with ""Pregnant"" within 90 seconds. Of course, I didn't trust it quite yet seeing that there had been plenty of false positives reported. I waited until the next day and took another one--within 60 seconds ""Pregnant"" popped up again. Still, I didn't quite trust the results, so I waited one more day to take another test. Another ""Pregnant"" popped up even faster! The next day was my beta blood test and the results came back at 163, so the digitals were clearly accurate for me!I don't like that the results go away in about 24 hours, but that is only because of my obsessive nature--I stare at the results to make sure they don't change on me. ha,ha. I did take an analog test at 14dpo and it came up with 2 very clear and dark lines.Overall, these are probably my favorite pregnancy tests. They are pricey, but worth it for me not to hold the test up in every different direction in all different light to see if there is a second line."

baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I love this pillow and it makes breastfeeding so much easier! For the tigh budget, this is not an essential item though and you might get a free pillow at the hospital, typically a boppy. I use the boppy pillow to support my baby while playing."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,4.0,"Love the back support. But I had to make more support underneath because it wasn't high enough for me. Of coarse, it depends on the hold you use with baby. I'm happy the cover can be washed. Kind of wish the two bumps on the top were remove-able. I like the one for baby's head, but not the one that sits under her butt. Nice and firm, and over-all happy with my purchase."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"My toddler daughter went straight from bottles to these sippy cups. I can't recommend them enough. They're inexpensive, BPA-free, easy to clean, spill-proof, durable, pretty, easy to hold, fit any cup holder, microwavable etc, etc... If you need sippy cups, just buy them."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,My kids love these so much I have to order them by the case (plus they're hard to find in my area grocery store)... They taste a little like cheetos but don't have the cheese.... Salty and yummy. A great snack!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"Well, its in the brand name, but they do mean it. This is spicy. NOt the creamy leek and potato soup you're used to. Has pieces of carrot and tomato. Some would like it. But not those wanting a real leak and potato."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"well, i was told that this product was supposed to help enlarge your breasts, but apparently it doesn't. at least for me, it didn't work. nothing against the seller. the shipping was quick and everything arrived as i was told it would. the product just didn't do what i thought it would is all."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"These bottles do exactly what they are supposed to- provide a protective ""shell"" for the Playtex drop-ins. I have had no problems with leaking. On a minor note, I do wish that they would make these in gender neutral colors. The description stated ""colors may vary"" and I have to laugh when I see my little guy drinking out of his pink and lavender bottles, not that he cares a bit. :) (The third bottle is yellow.) I also learned the hard way that the type of hard, clear plastic used for these bottles is somewhat brittle and also will melt when placed in a bottle warmer. Had I know that, I would have made sure to order the other type of Playtex nursers made from the clouded plastic."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,"My husband has been buying his Highlander Grog for 4 years from a local coffee shop. Sadly they went out of business so I told him, No Problem. I will order you some online. I read all the reviews and decided on this product. We received it promptly and he was so disappointed!!! It does not compare at all to what he is used to and we are donating it to the local homeless shelter. I will try others online and try to find him something he likes, but this was not it."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,"See the reviews for the watch. Other than whether or not the watch does anything more than count like the on-line calendars is up for debate but I think the biggest problem is these sensors that can't seem to last long enough to get through a cycle...Even with doing the water trick in their guidebook...Also since the band on the watch is so small, you have to undo it when putting it on/off (lots of fun with one hand) otherwise you run the risk of snapping the little tabs on the sensor which renders the sensor useless.DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT OR THE WATCH"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,We haven't actually used it yet since our grandchild isn't due until the end of December. I took it out of the box to look at it and I think it will be perfect for when they visit. It won't take up much room easy to store and will be get to take to with if we go out to eat.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I have a wheat allergy and struggle finding good tasting things I can eat. This is now on my list of tasty things. For having just caraway seeds and rye flour, it has a fairly good taste. It goes well with a variety of things including various cheeses and even tastes good with peanut butter. Moreover, it has practically no fat and lots of fiber. If you cannot eat wheat products or just want a good tasting alternative to crackers, this is a good choice at a very reasonable price. I do have one caution. This is not for folks who are gluten intolerant as rye flour does contain some gluten."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This product really works.I used to drool while sleeping from early childhood.After trying this product I rarely drool at night;however,I am going to try it once again in 4 months so that I totally get rid of drooling.There are also other products out there that should work for you.but this is what I have tried and seen the results."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"At this day i consume like 6 packs of animal pack (44 packs), and i can say is one of the best supplements avaliable. Yes you have to swallow 11 pills, that can be irritant, but you will find the way to deal with that. And your urine will turn phosphorescent yellow, but if you take sufficient liquids you will be all right.Now the good things about this product, it will improve your immune system a lot, maybe you never will have the experience of flu again, and that's very nice.I workout, and since i take animal pack, the results are very impressive. If you workout take this pack with some protein supplement and you will have a very good point to start with your food complement to achieve balance on your diet.Finally i truly recomend this product to any one that workout, or need improving in energy levels, and remember too, this product with a price around 20 or 25 usd is very affordable considering the pack of 44.Universal Animal Pak Sports Nutrition Supplement (Pack of 44)"

I only use them to flavor my coffee.I recently opened a bottle of the sugar-free Kahlua syrup and I may end up throwing it out. It smells awful, kind of sour. I don't know if it should smell this way in the bottle or if there is something off about MY bottle, but the odor is unbearable.I researched it online and can't find anything in relation to the Kahlua flavored syrup smelling funny.Better to toss it out than find out later on that there is something wrong with my particular bottle. I won't buy this flavor again.Sue"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,I discovered this hot sauce in a small cafe in Big Sur on my way back from Mendocino on my motorcycle. I usually use the green Tabasco but gave this a try. I now use 1 bottle minimum per week. I love mexican food so it goes great with burritos and such. I now buy 1 dozen at a time.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have a chronic insomnia problem and I find that melatonin helps. Keep in mind that it will not help if you have something seriously wrong with you such as a chronic pain problem that is keeping you awake. It's not strong enough to overcome that. But it does help with jet lag and it does help with some sleep conditions. You must use it correctly; unfortunately some physicians write that you only need the tiniest dose; others write that you need a higher dose. It is wise to follow a program for sleep hygiene
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I bought this for my husband who's crazy about perfumes. He loved it. It was different from the usual colognes/sprays. If you want to try something different, this is it!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I went to 3 ENT's (Ears, Nose, Throat specialist) for persistent ringing in my left ear. I had 2 MRI's done. They were not able to determine what the problem was other than a slight hearing loss at the very high end of the range, which I was assured was normal for a person of my age (45). The third ENT I consulted told me about this product. I tried it and the ringing stopped in only 3 days! It was so bad it was keeping me up at night. For me, this product has been a true miracle. I have not had any problems since. I began by taking the full dose. Now I only have to take 1 a day."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love ""Nows"" Organic Extra Virgin Macadamia Nut Oil. It has a very rich buttery taste that is a wonderful replacement for those of you who can't have Butter, because of Casein Sensitivities, which I do. I have been using Nows"" Organic Extra Virgin Macadamia Nut Oil for over several years now, it is great in salads, and on vegetables. It also fries at a higher heat than most Oils, and can be used in baking, which I have used for most of my Low carb muffins. I love this Oil, and have no plans to change it in the future, unless another Company comes out with a better product at a better price. So far that has not happened, and I have tried many different brands."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a classic iron supplement that has been a friend to women for years. It was one of the first created with absorption in mind. If you've ever taken ones that arent, you know the nasty, brassy-tasting, upset stomach results. Plus your body doesn't get the iron it needs when absorption isn't considered in manufacturing the product. You can buy a cheap ""iron"" supplement at your grocery store. Or you can buy a proven classic that won't make you feel like you ate a cast iron hammer for dinner. This is a great product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I am one of those people who when they get a bad cold it eventually settles into the chest in a very bad way (family genes) and each time it takes longer and longer to really lose the cough and congestion. Last weekend the latest cold making the rounds hit me and head sorely congested I spotted this on the grocery shelves and decided to give it a shot. While it isn't the greatest tasting tea ever, my head did clear up enough so that I passed on the cold medicine for the night, and the cold had pretty much cleared up the next morning, and virtually no chest congestion at all."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I've been using this product for about 50 years now and love it! Love the price on Amazon just as much as I can't get it locally for less than $3.50 a box (8 oz.) I'm stocking up!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I purchased this for my wife, who is pregnant. She has been using it successfully to alleviate lower back pain. She is very happy with it. It works nicely in a chair or in bed. The large size makes positioning it easy. Some reviews complain about it not getting hot enough, but my wife was happy with the temperature."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Both my wife and I and several of our friends have found this to be an amazing med. My wife gets car sick very easily. We recently took a trip through the mountains. She took the Marezine and not only did she not get sick, but she was able to play games and read email on her iPhone. Something that was totally out the question in the past. I also found it quite effective on a boat excursion in Hawaii and in car rides. I also took it before going to a Six Flags theme park in the summer and made it through the crazy ride fine. We have experienced no adverse side effects."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,4.0,"This is delicious, classic Scottish-style porridge, but it took me a few tries to get it right. The microwave method simply doesn't work - you end up with a layer of hardened oats and exploding liquid on top. What is best to do is to use a pan. Boil the water as the package directs (though unless you want it salty, I'd use only a dash of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp.). When you add the porridge, add it into the simmering water bit by bit, whisking throughly during and after. Then simmer as normal with the lid on. This method solved all my problems with the porridge. It made it fluffy, light and truly edible. No more scraping burnt porridge off the bottom of the pan or rushing to break up gluey lumps. Now, I make a batch of this and simply heat it up with a little milk and cinnamon every morning."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,1.0,This is the most disgusting drink I have ever tried! Don't buy unless you know what it is!

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"These cups are awesome. The tops are such a soft plastic that my daughter can easily grab her snacks. I have only had this brand, but have some friends with other brands, and ouch! The tops are such a hard plastic and once they saw mine, purchased this brand. I like all the colors and graphics - although I have scrubbed some of the designs off, so now I try to wash them a little softer ;) Super product!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,3.0,"We've been using this brush for about two months. It is used exclusively for cleaning baby bottles/nipples and milk pump accessories (horns/valves, etc). It is a decent brush, but does not seem to hold up, and we'll need to replace it soon.Having the suction cup bottom is handy, as it allows us to leave it standing next to the sink without worried about it getting contaminated. It seems to work well on the bottles we use (Nuk & Medela 5 oz and straight wall 80cc). The bristles tend to fill the bottles well, and clean them thoroughly. When used on the non-straight-wall bottles, you tend to get sprayed as the bristles flick back to their normal position when pulling the brush out of the bottle. Annoying, but probably going to happen with any bristle-type brush. The smaller brush is handy for getting the inside of the Nuk/Medela nipples, which are too small to fit my fingers into for cleaning.The major downside is that the bristles are already compacting on the larger brush, so it is getting more difficult to use in cleaning the pump horns, and doesn't get the corners of the normal bottles as well as it used to. We'll have to replace it soon, and don't expect the next to last much longer than this one.NOTE"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,I highly recommend this popcorn if you don't like picking hulls out of your teeth! Both the kettle corn and plain are very good.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"My toddler loves these crackers and I do too! They are the best snack now that I am pregnant again in my first trimester. They are only 120 calories per bag and are just the right salty, cheesy, cracker combo. They are a little salty, but not too bad (15%). My son likes them so much that he immediately learned to say 'crackers' after I bought them.I subscribed and got the discounted price, but when I don't need them right away, I can adjust the shipment so I am not drowning in crackers, which is nice! Yummy!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea has the most fragrant, soothing flavor...when it is fresh. But BEWARE, as the label warns, it has a short shelf life and must be stored in a glass jar in the freezer or refrigerator.Make the mistake of not heeding this warning and your tea will spoil very quickly."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Well, it can get a bit pricey but I don't pump like Arnold so I don't need that much-- just a frothy serving once a day is fine with me. I mix it with soy or rice or almond milk -- since I am sometime allergic to cow's milk.The company says that Musce Milk is similar to Mother's milk -- we all I suppose retain a primitive memory of the days of our suckling infanthood, and that said, the nutrients in Muscle Milk are IMHO combined to nourish our bodies, and our musculature just like those nutrients compounded by Mother Nature for us to grow and develop on, way back when.Muscle Milk tastes great - I sometimes add coffee or blend it with fruit, to add a little variety.Definitely worth the price. And once the huge container is emptied, punch some holes around the bottom and use it for a planter (I'm serious)."

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,I'm very pleased. The previous one I had was similar and lasted about 2 years before the plastic got cloudy and a bit cracked. I'm sure this one will not last any longer; that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It keeps the pills separate and organized and lets me know my remaining supply at a glance.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,What can i say. this is a long term investment in my health. Call me back in 30 years... to see if I'm still alive.It tastes awful. But I hope it works. They should add more DHA power to it. that's all.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This mix is amazing! All of my friends who have tasted it, think it is just as tasty as any regular pancake. And the chocolate chip recipe on the bag is to die for. My friends love it and always request that I make them for events. You can use this mix just as you would use bisquick, it is very versatile. It is a must have staple for any gluten free kitchen."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"These are fantastic! I wish I would have bought them years ago, it would have saved a lot of sheets! I have purchased the disposable kind, and they never work. By the time my husband wakes up the disposable pad is a twisted mess. These blue pads stay in place and absorb.They wash wonderfully too. My husband has a lot of health issues, and I didn't think this pad would ever be clean, but it came out of the washer like new.I would recommend buying two, so you can have one to use, while the other is in the laundry. I am going to buy another for the couch too."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I have used this Skillet Toss with lots of different add-ins for a variety of dishes---sausage bits ,mushroom/onions, olives and extra cheese.You might want to try it with other forms of pasta, too. Works well.Good choice for a hearty meal that doesn't really seem that ""last minute""."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I was having trouble winding down at night, so I shopped around and found this Yogi Bedtime tea. I loved it right off the bat because it smelled so wonderful. I was surprised by the licorice flavor because it wasn't overpowering at all. It was ever so mild in the back of my throat. Overall, the flavor was delicate and smooth. Although this didn't help me fall asleep, it was still a good tea that helped me relax and calm down after a long day."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Maybe it is the little drizzle of icing they put on the top, but this one, along with the Gingerbread (another season bar) are both too sweet. I do like the taste however! If they could just cut down a tad on the sugary taste, I think it would taste better. These bars have a great texture and consistency - and a mild pumpkin spice flavor. Had they been less sweet, they'd have received 5 stars. Compared to other favorites, such as the oatmeal and walnut, these are just too sweet. So, if the regular clif bars are not sweet enough for you, these are pretty close to a chewy cookie. They are also seasonal - so get some while you can :-)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I've used a few other protein powders which didn't restrict carbs/sugars and this bad boy (rich chocolate) from Dymatize still tastes great if not better than Optimized Nutrition products. It's sweetened with Stevia (A+) NOT Splenda, Malitol, etc. Highly recommended if you're looking for an alternative to the overpriced Jay Robb. Try it for yourself at this price."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,I have tried several inserts you find in your local stores with no help. My family doctor recommended these and after trying one pair I am sold!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am a huge consumer of organic and natural products. As a man, I have found it hard to find a good natural deodorant that was strong enough for me. I have tried several different brands and nothing worked to my satisfaction, until I tried herbal magic.This is the only natural deodorant I have tried that keeps me smelling fresh all day long!It also has moisture absorbing abilities, something that I have not found in other natural deodorants."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,rice cakes,5.0,"Since I am on a wheat free diet, shopping for rice cakes has become a hobby. Lundberg Organic Brown Rice Cakes are the best ! Crunchy and full flavored. Found that the organic ones are even better than the regular ones, but all of the Lundberg rice cakes are at the top of my list."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,I thought it was really strong at first and didn't mix that well. After a few times I got used to the taste. It still could use improvement on the creaminess and cookie taste. Makes me not as sore a couple days after my workouts though. I think it works well.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"Love these bottles. I know they are safe and they are the only nipples my daughter will use. She is mostly breastfed, except a couple days a week when mommy is back at work. Getting her to take the bottle was a HUGE challenge but she ended up getting the hang of it, although she still prefers the breast to the bottle:) The only downside that I can think of is there are a lot of parts to wash/sterilize, but I also bought the microwave sterilizer and a dishwasher container so it makes it a little easier."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,These are small lentils - we enjoyed them. They cook up nice and taste good.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"One of the best gluten free product I've tried. These Pretzels taste like the real deal! They go very fast at my house, I have to keep them coming. I pack them everyday in my brown bag and snack at them through out my work day. I love how they go with coffee."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I've used prescription patches and these patches. These have worked far better for me -- especially because they fit better on my neck and don't fall off.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,1.0,"I somehow managed to drink one bottle (it was hot, I was desperate). It really tastes bad. I have all the rest sitting in my cabinet, never to be sipped by me. When I am dead, I'm sure they will be thrown away. I know, what do I mean by ""bad."" Well, I almost felt like I would get sick if I drank a whole bottle straight. Maybe it is good for you, but the taste is so raunchy that I would have to be on a desert island to drink it."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"I purchased the BD Digital Basal Thermometer in hopes to track my cycle more closely and add to the ease of mind when it comes to getting pregnant. So far so good. Easy to use, love the memory feature that allows you to turn it on after it being off and seeing the previous temp taken. However, my temperatures haven't been stable at all. Even day to day at times, even after taking it at the same time. I'm not sure if it's the thermometer or my own body. I am willing however to keep trying for a few more months to see if things even out. Overall a good purchase!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"I thought these were a great idea, and they smelled amazing, but...they were kind of lame. Sharp-tasting, and because they were so big, they didn't melt all the way through when I toasted them, so I had to kind of eat off the outer layer and re-toast the marshmallow a few times before I finished it. If I were to get them again, I would probably cut them into quarters, but that seems like a lot of work for a stupid holiday gift."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Provence Rooibos is my top favorite tea. Smooth, refreshing, aromatic -- recalls a walk in a flower garden after a rain (sorry to be poetic, but I don't know another way of describing it).

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,This is the 4th sound machine I've bought. Have them for different rooms and one for traveling. My original was bought in 1980 and finally gave out. this one is excellent.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,1) Price is reasonable. 2)The taste is not bad and was easy to consume with a little bit of water. 3)It takes time to see results but with consistency it will pay off. 4)I will purchase again but with alcohol.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I really like this tea. It has a mellow blueberry flavor that is sure to satisfy.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"If you've had this, then you already know. I can never find it in stores, so I was happy to find it still exists! Shipping is a little steep, but if you order a few at a time, you'll be set for a while."

health personal care,health care,foot care,3.0,"I have tons of insoles, and these are decent. I also have several Tuli heel cups which I think are excellent at cradling and supporting the heel. What I wish Tuli made were insoles that have their full heel cup built in so we could have arch support along with heel adjustment. When I saw the waffle heels on these insoles, I dared to hope that Tuli had combined the two, but alas, it was only a slight indent. Frankly I think the Spenco supports with firm arches are better, even without the heel cup.Tuli, if you are listening"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,You actually have to put these on your clothes instead of directly on your skin.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This stuff is amazing. Not only does it make decent pancakes, but you can use it as a wheat-flour substitute in many recipes and get better results than using most other gf flour substitutes. As long as you aren't baking dairy-free as well (this has dairy in it), use this instead of wheat flour. Good in muffin recipes, corn breads, banana breads, and makes a fine coating for fried chicken. Buy it in bulk and get free delivery, which saves a ton of money over buying the little tiny bags at the supermarket.Honestly the best, most useful food purchase I've made on the Internet."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I bought the EAS Myoplex Lite Nutrition Shake, chocolate cream flavor, because I'm a student and sometimes I'm in too much of a hurry to have a proper meal, especially for breakfast. This shake is great for that. I got the Blendtec blender bottle and I mix it with water and it gets nice and thick. The chocolate flavor is not too sweet and has a nice balance. The nutrition is enough to keep me going for a few hours, especially if I have a piece of fruit. This isn't the kind of shake you'd want to mix with anything else. I prefer it with water rather than milk."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm 59 years old and I started taking this about 5 years ago. I had tried all the glucosamine chondroitin products on the market, because I had severe arthritis in both of my thumb joints that was very painful. I also had trigger finger of my right ring finger that snapped painfully every time I used that hand. Within months both were cured and pain-free. I have taken it daily ever since. I only needed one a day and you can take as many as four a day. Two years ago I saw my brother who was considering a carpal tunnel operation. I recommende Arthriflex and he is pain-free and didn't need an operation after taking it several months. The stuff really works, so help me God. I have had to start buying it online, because the store I use to buy it from quit stocking it. I couldn't understand why, because I always bought them out of their supply. Please try it. I feel that it is the added chicken collagen that makes it better than any other product of its kind."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My four like most animal parade vitamins. These aren't bad, but as one reviewer said, they have a tart taste at the end. Some kids may like this. I love the fact that they have the seaweed chlorella in them. I have heard so much good about this superfood, but wasn't sure about an appropriate amount for kids. So this is my solution. The kids complained at first, but I gave them no choice and now they mostly like it. The one that doesn't, I tell to eat with her Vitamin C chewable and she doesn't complain at all anymore. It is so worth it! I love the Animal Parade line of Vitamins!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"I've been using The Keeper for about nine years - I'm here to buy a new one. I used tampons for at least 10 years before I learned about The Keeper.I'll be honest - the first couple months were a little rocky. I'm not used to getting that up close and personal with myself, especially during the times The Keeper was made for. But now I have no idea how I got along without it!I travel a lot for work and now I no longer have to allocate precious suitcase space for tampons or gamble that I can get some wherever I'm going or just hope I won't need them before I get back. I throw my Keeper in the suitcase every time - it takes up no space and I'm covered.And I'll try not to be gross, but we all know what happens when you take out a tampon too late (yuck!) or too soon (OW! and then OW! when you put its replacement in). Those problems are a distant, unpleasant memory for me, as are my old fears of Toxic Shock Syndrome.One of the best, most unexpected benefits is that using The Keeper actually takes a day, sometimes two, off my period! I assume it must be because there's no barrier (absorbent though it may be) to slow the flow. That's almost two weeks a year!Of course the savings in money and trash are obvious.So yes, there's a bit of a learning curve but you can do it and it's totally worth it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Just received this table and was impressed with the quality overall. I'm a big guy, 270lb, and this table holds me well with no squeaking, creaking or shaking. It's very solid and stable. I liked everything about it except the cover. It feels a little stiff rather than soft an supple. It's OK with some nice sheets or a cover on it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I tried it on myself and my girlfriend who always have sore muscles on the shoulders and the back. This thing didn't really help loosen the knot or anything like that. The rod looks flimsy, could have be done much better."

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"After having used the contraceptive pill for several years, I noticed a severe lack of cervical mucus once I stopped using it. Since my husband and I are soon planning on trying to conceive, I decided to do a little research on natural products that would maximize our chances of conceiving. I came accross FertileCM- I started using it while on the second day of my menstrual period. I am a few days away from my predicted ovulation date and can already tell a huge difference! My cervical mucus in now pre-pill quality and quantity ( and better!!). Not sure if it increased my libido, as the product claims it does. No side effects. The tablets are a little large in size ( for me at least), which caused minor discomfort upon swallowing them. Other than that, highly recommend!!"
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"I love this pill case! The pink is a great color, the shape is different than usual pill cases, and the magnets are handy to put on the fridge, so I won't forget to take my pills. It's a little smaller than I was expecting, but it's actually the perfect size..not too big, not too small."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This product made me so sick I thought I was going to die! Had severe watery diarrhea and violent vomiting!! It was terrible. I have taken other brands of glucosamine-chrondroitin and had no problems so it's clearly not those two ingredients. Some people are sensitive/allergic to something in Move Free's formula. If you're not one of them, it might work for you. If you are, beware you're in for about a 12 hour period of severe misery beginning several hours after you take it."

health personal care,health care,thermometers,2.0,"I figured out the problem with this thermometer. It's not about how you use it, it's about on who it's used. If I use it on my younger daughter (age 5), it's fairly accurate; measuring mostly 98.6. If I use it on myself (age not divulged), it's always at least a degree too cool (97.4). If I use it on my older daughter (age 7), it's almost always about a degree too high (99.4). These results are almost without fail, and can be expected if I take all our temperatures one after another, in varying orders or at different times of the day. As a result, because it's so expensive, we still use it, but I take the reading and subtract/add according to the regular readings I get. I'm surprised that this hasn't been mentioned before."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I started having some kind of gut problem, Doctors still dont know what, after 2 months and a bunch of tests, meanwhile, they immediately put me on anti-inflammatories for the gut, they were helping a little but after two weeks, I introduced Primal Defense and then later added some acidophilus type probiotics, this action, seemed to make an immediate and noticeable difference in my gut, lessoning of the bloating and firmed up my very loose stools and slowed down the number of times I was headed for the bathroom..... it might be that the introduction of Primal Defense (PD), is fixing things, well enough that its is causing all my doctors blood tests results, to be inconclusive for Crohn's or IB, I pray but I just dont know for sure, its probably too soon, to crack the Champaign......but because of the immediate reaction I experienced in my gut (after two days of double dosing PD), I do feel this product made a difference in the short run anyway. (I have been taking about 5-6 capsules on an empty stomach, each day, for about a month now) I would really like to have the doctors tell me what happened to my gut at the age of 60 with no prior problems but either way, I have to work on getting off of the anti-inflammatories.... but I will be keeping a bottle of Primal Defense, filled, in my pantry until I am cured of gut problems or find something that works better!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"This product has gone up in price about 25% from July 2010 to November2010. As much as I like the quality, I will have to resort to Walmart because in my opinion there is no justification for such a price hike. It is just greed of the producer and total disregard of the consumer."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"While aquarists debate and discuss which brand is the best, labs and universities continue to select Instant Ocean for their studies. Instant Ocean is one of the largest makers of marine salt in the world. They know what they are doing. On the other end of the spectrum you have true hand-made marine salt. I have made marine salt in a lab. I used 100% super purity chemicals and salts. It was a lengthy process and very expensive. We used the salts for years and also compared the tanks to Instant Ocean salts. There was no difference in the tanks. The lab no longer makes marine salt. It was easier to buy Instant Ocean."

I turned it on and put it at 15 minutes, since its still morning time. I have to say that I feel more awake already and feel in a pretty good mood strangely enough! I don't know if its just the novelty of it but I'll make another review in 30 days to verify if it indeed works."

It got me through with hardly a complaint with no other supplements or HRT. It didn't work as well for everyone I know who tried it but they all felt some degree of relief. It's absolutely worth trying.

In fact I only noticed it was missing when I tried to fill the pot ""upto to the top of the logo"" as instructed in the leaflet.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,I have been doing lots of research on this little bottle for quite a while and without even knowing what i was really purchasing i decided to buy it. I have been patient to get this in the mail and it only took 3 days to get delivered. I was so exited and as i opened the bottle and dabbed a small amount on my wrist I became so in love with it. It smells like fruity and sweet but yet soft... its just an irresistible smell. I will definitely buy this product over and over again. I am so exited to start wearing this due to my husband coming back home from a 6 month deployment next week. :)

grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,1.0,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me. The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However, when I went to eat another bag I opened it and it had a very strong smell of rancid oil that dominated any salt and vinegar smell or flavor. I then opened 2 more bags and they had the exact same issue. Chips in these bags were essentially non-edible or at least not inanyway pleasant to eat. Rancid oil can't be a good thing to consume. Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired. This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out. That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips. So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future."

I'm not a huge fan of large grain tapioca in my puddings-- I prefer it smaller-- and this fits the bill perfectly. Not only is it a nice size, it is far superior tasting to other store shelf tapiocas available. Love this stuff!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Think your kids won't eat bran? Well, think again! Jiffy bran muffins are my kids absolute favorite and we're in a crisis because I can no longer find them at my local supermarkets. They are very easy to bake, smell great and make nice little 'lunch box stuffers'. I add cinnamon and an all-bran cereal to the mix (along with a little extra milk) to extend the mix and make them even more nutritious. They're great from the oven warm with a pat of butter, with your favorite marmalade or NAKED! Try them for the whole family, instead of cookies or pastries. Now, if I can only get my paws on them again! Wind In Hare"

I aim to eat (5) 300 calorie meals daily to control my weight and fat levels (not an easy task at all) and the Clif Builder's Bar is a part of my daily regimen! The taste is a perfect blend of chocolate and mint and the local Trader Joe's near me is always sold out of this flavor!! As a result, I now buy on monthly subscription so I am guaranteed the product, and the price on Amazon is the best by far anywhere on the planet!If you are seeking high protein meal replacement with excellent taste, this is your product!Good luck getting those ripped abs!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,This splashmat is very light-weight but of good quality to protect your floor. We have carpet in our dining area and so far nothing has penetrated. The colors and design are fun. It is easy to shake off and fold away for the next meal. I have washed it in the washing machine when needed and it has retained its shape and colors well. I definitely recommend this product. I just wish it covered a little bit larger area. My 14-month old's food occasionally ends up beyond its reach.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,5.0,"I put my daughter on this formula when she was about 6 weeks old. I was breastfeeding and finding that she had SUCH a sensitive tummy that pretty much anything I ate bothered her. I now breastfeed about 1/4 of the time and give her mostly this alimentum and it made a HUGE difference! No more rashes or reflux problems. It IS expensive which is why buying it here is awesome ... good price and delivered quickly to your door. Some have said that it doesn't mix well but I went and bought some of the 89 cent gerber bottles and mix in there and then pour it into her bottle and that helps. I also found that room temp water helps it mix easier. And while it definitely smells worse than other formulas, I tasted a bit on my finger and felt it tasted about the same."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Taste is excellent and it dissolves really well in milk or water.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I use 2,000 mg/day of B-5 to treat a skin condition. Along with Adovia sulfur soap, this treatment works very well, and the condition has largely subside. There isn't much more I can really say. The FDA regulates these kinds of products and requires that manufacturers meet reasonable quality standards, so any comments I might make on such matters is beside the point. The dosage is very convenient for my purposes (only two big tablets a day), and the pricing is very competitive. I get so much of this in a bottle that it seems to last forever (not really, but I know I don't have to get more very often). Hope this helps.As a side note, I've noticed that Amazon carries a pretty good range of such supplements (and also OTC medications) in a generic form. I used to go to the local CVS or RiteAid for such things, but the products on Amazon are a much better deal. And with Amazon Prime, the delivery service brings these to my front door in two days or less. I feel like I'm being waited on hand and foot, and saving money at the same time. Good for you, Amazon."

They are expensive in my local health food store so I was happy to find them here at such a great price. The auto-ship is perfect for the cookie monsters in my house. I only wish Amazon would find a better way to ship them. They do often come a little banged up for my liking.Try them! If you like Nutter Butters I think you will like these. You should at least like the fact that they are made with ingredients you can actually pronounce!"

It mixes very easy, it has MANY flavors to choose from, and the vanilla flavor(s) mix very well with fruit, etc. It has a great mix of many of the vitamins, and nutrients that you have to take with ""other"" brand protein powders.All this, and add to it the low Amazon price + subscribe and save feature, and you have near perfection!

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"A friend purchased this product for me to try a few years ago. It works as promised. I don't--WON'T-follow instructions to the letter (2X/day? Organic apples, bananas, blueberries? Purified water?) And I'm not a die-hard health nut, so I don't mind adding in soy (milk), or dairy (kefir), or nuts (almond butter).Still, it's a lot of nutrition for the price (&lt;$1/meal); a bargain even if you factor in the added fruit. And an ""ultimate"" bargain if you factor in the supplements provided (vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements) that you'd need to buy separately. Probably should check these ingredients, though, to make sure you can tolerate them.There's no getting around the greens-flavored taste of this powder, but it's no worse than other superfood beverages. The product's website has some good recipes and suggestions. One I've used is similar to what's on the canister (minus the ""organic""), except I substitute vanilla soymilk for the water (flavor/thickness). I include 1/2 cup frozen raspberry/blueberry mix that changes the color from green to purplish and sweetens the flavor. (I know fresh is better, but--trust me--cold is what helps makes this concoction palatable.)After three days of drinking this for breakfast, I felt more energized. It's filling as a light meal would be (3-4 hours as opposed to the advertised 3-6 hours). Didn't really experience the ""detox"" side-effects that others have mentioned (at least nothing I wouldn't experience from a high-fiber meal), but I also chased it with a bottle of water.As other reviewers mentioned, this is a bit of a ""stone soup fable"" misnomer. If you add 1/2-cup berries, 1/2 apple, and a banana (along w/cup of soymilk), this will be a pretty filling, higher-calorie (but nutritionally dense) meal.It's completely organic, vegan, kosher, free of glutens, soy, yeast, salt, dairy, egg, and cholesterol. The protein (16 g) is from vegan sources (quinoa/millet, amaranth, brown rice, spirulina).Says it's unsweetened, but other astute reviewers have pointed out there's stevia (a natural alternative calorie-free sweetener). Had to run out to check the canister myself.If you can get past the flavor and find a recipe that works for you, I definitely recommend Ultimate Meal!"

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I have been in chronic pain for going on 4 years, due to 5 disc herniations in my neck. I have repeatedly seen the SPI advertised in catalogs and online, and it always got my attention by the claims that sounded bogus. I am a chiropractic student and am well aware of how the cranio-sacral pump works, but never had it worked on. I had a friend apply pressure with his fingers on my still points, and it helped my pain greatly. I decided at that point that it was time to buy the thing. I got it in the mail, and immediately tried it because i was in pain. WOW! this thing is so amazing...it relaxes the cervical muscles so well. However, it is just a temporary fix, and doesn't replace actually getting rid of the problem, something that chiropractic works wonders for, and so much more."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"I would say the best thing that I've found about this heating pad is the customer service. The first one I purchased a few years ago worked the longest, they replaced it with no problem when I kept getting the F1 or F2 code on it. Unplugging it and plugging it back in worked at first.I've received about 4 other ones to replace other ones with the same code, this last one only lasted a month, so I'm losing faith in them, and asked if they had a more durable one that I could order. Will see what they say. The last one started arcing where the plug goes into the pad, and they had me send that one back. I'm a little leary of getting another one of the same kind this time, even if offered.The replacements did come in a timely manner, within about 5 days, but noone can tell me why I keep getting the same code. I loved the fit, the feeling of it, and it worked perfectly with my chronic kidney stone and kidney pain. It just makes me sad that they don't work longer. Going to try a different one this time around I think."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"For many years this amazing invention has been a lifesaver for me. When my neck, or any other area, starts tocause me problems, I grab my neckease. put it into the microwave, and within minutes I'm on the way to feelingmuch better. I don't remember how many years I've had it, so that in itself tells that it's been quite a few.Even if my neck is not misbehaving, sometimes it's just comforting to have the warmth of it on dreary winterdays. A wonderful product, I highly recommend it.Grammy"

Even our daughter (who can eat gluten products) prefers this mix over those with gluten. Its very versatile in that you can make bisquits, banana breads etc. from it as well and there are lots of great recipes on the back."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love these liners!I bought them for breast milk storage because bottles take up so much freezer space and the ziplock breast milk storage bags in the market are too expensive (if you consider the per piece cost)!I usually pump in 2-4oz increments because I don't want to have to thaw a huge amount of milk only to find out that the baby only wants 2oz of it. Hence, I needed a lot of bags and since storage bags with ziplocks are costly, I decided that this is the best choice.I also found out that they're pretty strong! You can reuse them if you want to. Personally, I don't because it's such a hassle to wash, sterilize, and dry them.Finally, I have Avent bottles so I couldn't use this as liners but I could just imagine how convenient it would be if my bottles were the playtex nursers! Too bad my baby's used to the Avent nipples."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I twisted my back recently (ouch!) and this was a lifesaver. Everyone should have this in their drawer.The pain relief act much like Ben-Gay and Tiger-balm, except this one is a patch AND the pungent pepperminty fragrance is not as pervasive.As a patch, this item also has an advantange of not sticking to your clothes, which is the biggest problem I have with Ben-Gay and Tiger-balm.SalonPas takes about 20 minutes to hit its peak effectiveness, and when it does, the cooling pain-killing sensation is unlike any other pain relieving balm or patch.It loses its peak effectiveness after about 1.5 hours and its overall effectivenss after about 7 hours of so, but it still does its job for upto 10 hours.When I was in bed for almost a week with a twisted back, advil and SalonPas was all I needed to recover with minimal pain and discomfort.If you are looking for a great Ben-gay or tiger-balm alternative that won't stick to your clothes, then this is a great option.My only issue with this particular SalonPas was that it was too small (3 patches could fit in one hand). Luckily, amazon also sells the much larger SalonPas patches which is what I recommend for back-pain sufferers."

health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"First a tip to those who are having leaks with babies younger than a year old, because really you shouldn't be leaking yet at that age -- always use a special nighttime diaper and go up a diaper size for your night diapers when you start getting leaks, even if your baby is still using the smaller size day diaper. That always did the trick for us. That is, up until about 19 months old when we got up to size 5 and then 6 in nighttime diapers (Huggies) and they just weren't big around at the waist in front to contain the urine for a boy who sleeps on his stomach a lot. I tried using a maxi pad across the top inside the diaper and that helped a little but I still got leaks. I determined we needed simply extra absorbency inside the diaper so I got these Tranquility mini booster pad liners. I was desperate because we were having bad leaks every single night. Oh my gosh, what a relief. They worked from the first night onward. No leaks 4 nights in a row so far. For my boy, I don't put these across the top horizontally, I put them vertically inside the diaper but place them further up in front for a stomach-sleeping boy. The edge of the liner should be at the edge of the top front waist part, or just below that. Other tips"

grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,cheese,5.0,"Nothing like white goat cheese, it's sweet and with a tiny hint of bitter. Being a norwegian-american family we eat it every day if we can get hold of it. I was surprised to see it listed as gourmet, its an everyday food over there. Its sliced using a cheese slicer, a knife or wire cutter will cut too thick. bjorklund makes a good one. Most commonly served on buttered rolls or bread. I like it on a sandwich with a layer of good jam under. Its good on toast and buttered waffles where the heat causes the slices to sweat and melt slightly, changing the texture, and making it delicious."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I purchased this specific product having already tried it out at physical therapy (in the 9"" x 24"" size). It can be placed in the freezer for cold use; it stays flexible, unlike many of the smaller square cooling products that end up like an ice cube brick (those are best used for keeping food cold in styrofoam containers). The elasto-gel attaches (for me at the knees) with velcro straps (while you are lying down, you can't conveniently walk around with it on your knee). At physical therapy, they put a triangular pillow (at home a regular one will do fine) for added comfort.I bought two of these (one for each knee). I also tried the product in its warm configuration (sticking it in the microwave) with the thought I would use it on my back--it was like handling spaghetti--not helpful--you might as well use a heating pad for warmth even though those darned things mean an electrical plug limits placement. Save the elastro-gel for cooling. If someone has a suggestion for warm use that's easier than my effort, please advise in a comment.Overall"

The bar has gotten smaller over the years, but the package has stayed the same size. Just kind of annoying. It makes me feel like the company wants the customer to believe the bar in larger. Also, several other companies are lowering the sugar content without compromising taste. I believe Clif could do this as well."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Why I love this chai:+ You control the sweetness and sweetener.+ It's organic.+ Good and spicy.+ Great alternative to coffee (or cocoa).How I make it:I use a one literBormioli Rocco Glass Storage Pitcher 34-oz., available on Amazon (also highly recommended ).+ Heat 3-4 c. water (2/3 pitcher- I use electric kettle to heat).+ Pour hot water over two teabags in a glass pitcher or teapot. Steep the teabags in hot water 3-5 minutes (I then dunk the bags a few more times trying to get the most flavor out :).+ Heat large mug of milk (approx. 2 c. in microwave, 1-2 min, while tea steeps).+ Add heated milk (to fill pitcher) and sweetener to taste.It's soooooo good! A great start to the day and a treat any time. I introduced family to this over Thanksgiving, and they loved it too. I told my niece, who was hesitant to try it, to think of it as a spicy vanilla cocoa. That's a pretty good description."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"My medical provider's reproductive health (aka infertility) department recommends using the Clearblue Easy brand for pregnancy and ovulation tests. The first time I purchased pregnancy tests in the hospital's pharmacy, I got the standardClearblue Easy Pregnancy Test +/- Results, 3-Count""line or no line"" tests, but like many other people, I was confused by the results. Because they have a control line that shows up no matter what your results are, I was excited at first, then disappointed to find out that it shows up every time. Oops!Well, all future confusion can now be avoided! I had to make sure I was not pregnant to start a certain medication and before going in for bloodwork at the lab (and possibly a surprise result), I used one of the Clearblue Easy digital pregnancy tests! It took less than 2 minutes to result after being ""activated"" and while I waited an hourglass icon displayed on the screen. Then, once resulted, it was clear that I was ""Not Pregnant."" No confusion, no comparing the instructions to the test stick. Straight forward and to the point, there's the result!Clearblue Easy's digital tests are a $1-2 dollars more each, but if you find yourself testing and re-testing with the standard test, you might as well spend a few extra dollars for a one-time result! Now that I have tried this product, I'll only buy this kind.I'm going to upload a photo of the product!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"I like this rice pasta better than wheat. It has a nice chewy quality, it feels substantial against any sauce. I don't care for rice, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that Tinkyada Brown Rice Spirals go really well with Indian and Chinese cuisines. And it's made with Brown Rice, could it be better? It's surprised me totally how good this rice pasta tastes! And for the gluten sensitive it's really wonderful."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I bought this tea over a year ago, when the vanilla chai latte's were becoming fashionable at Starbucks. I was at a Starbuck's inside of my local Kroger and asked for a Vanilla Chai Latte. She said, oh you mean a Chai Tea (bag) with a shot of vanilla & steamed milk. I looked at her kind of strange. She said, great, I'll get it for you right away. She rang it up and it was half of the price that I normally pay. Well, she put a Chai Tea bag in my cup, put a shot of vanilla on top of it and poured water up to 3/4 of the cup and topped it off with steamed milk. She told me to give it a few minutes, a stir and I should be ready to go. To my surprise, with a tsp of sugar, it tasted exactly like its more expensive counterpart. I did the rest of my shopping and before I checked out, I went back to the young lady and said, thank you for showing me another way to make my favorite drink, can I buy those tea bags in here? She said that the tea bags that Starbucks use, are kind of pricey, but that she tried the one by Celestial Seasonings ""Honey Vanilla Chai,"" and it was the closest to our beloved drink. Well, that was the beginning of the love affair with me and this tea. I usually steep it with hot water and top it with either half&half or just milk with 1 tsp of sugar (I've also tried a tsp of honey which is equally as good). I had not drank any of it in a while and went to the pantry to make me a cup the other day... well, my husband has been in my last package and left 1 tea bag (you know men) and we have looked all over the place and cannot find it locally anymore. Thanks Amazon for making this available to me... and what a deal, especially knowing that I have two drinkers in this house instead of one. Thanks again!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've tried a number of protein powders and all of them were way too sweet. Most used an alternative sweetner such as Stevia, Sucralose, etc. Sugar is sweet enough but those artificial sweetners are 100 times sweeter and make me gag after awhile. So i finally decided to try an unsweetened one and this turns out to be excellant. Plus it states BGH Free. It costs more than the ones I have purchased in the past but I do not use protein powder every day, even when weight training, so decided to go with it. If you find it not flavorful enough due to no sugar, just use over ripe bananas and/or vanilla yogurt and that will be all the sweet you need. I also add dark chocolate baking cocoa, milk or almond milk, and a dash of maple syrup if my bananas were not ripe enough. And yes, this powder mixes perfectly. NO clumps. I use a cheap blender. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever aside from wishing the price would come down a bit."

Within about 20 minutes of taking 2-3 capsules, the physical symptoms of anxiety (tight chest, heart pounding, etc.)fade away. Co-workers went from making fun of me for keeping this in my desk to asking me to order them some too, once they tried it. I don't experience any sedation effects from this, but one person who tried mine thought the Valerian was too relaxing, so if you know you're sensitive to Valerian, be aware it's in this product. This is a product I've ordered several times on Amazon, as the price is usually several dollars less than I can find it locally. Highest recommendation."

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I bought one of these three years ago and a second one a few months ago. One is in our bedroom and other in our daughter's, they both work great.Read the instructions. They explain that you must add salt to the water, the exact amount will depend on your water, but you'll figure it out after a few uses. I add a little shy of 1/4 teaspoon and the humidifier runs quietly from when we go to bed until morning. If I'm heavy handed with the salt then it gurgles a little and it runs out of water before we wake but it's not a big deal. If I was scant on the salt then it puts out less steam.I only have two complaints. One is there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off. Second, there is still an inch or so of water in the reservoir when the water is too low for it to emit steam. The unit works best if you dump this out and start fresh every night. As other reviewers have noted (and as mentioned in the instructions), there are black mineral flecks in the remaining water. I just dump it in the toilet and refill the reservoir (and add salt). It seems all the affordable humidifiers have some convenience flaw. This humidifier is so affordable, these two complaints are so minor I obviously bought a second one.You can't tell from the picture, but you can rotate the blue part to any direction (it houses all the inner workings and vents the steam). It's a super simple design that works. If you find the blue part ""floats,"" then you've over-filled it past the mark on the reservoir.Our apartment is cold and drafty. These humidifiers definitely make the bedrooms feel warmer. It doesn't so much change the air temperature as make the air more comfortable.If you want a fancy humidifier, this isn't it. If you want an inexpensive one that works, consider this one."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have played around with this and made alot of different colors and shades. Although the only color I had problems with was black, I could not reach the true black color I got purple. Other than that I think all the colors are easy to use and you dont need alot to reach the shade your looking for. If some gets on your counter, it might stain but I used windex with ammonia in it and it came right up. The black did stain my plastic bowl purple but other than that this is a great product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product. The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,3.0,"I purchased this product for years in a grocery store that no longer carries it, so I'm very familiar with it. The box was exactly as shown and correct, and the granola was great as always. However, the fruit packs are packaged separately in the box and out of the first 3 boxes I've used, the fruit pack was NOT date almond, but raisin, not what I wanted. I think the manufacturer is to blame, not Amazon since they can't open every box. I can live with the raisin because I do like the granola, but there are a lot of raisin granolas on the grocery shelves."

This is an exclamation mark in the herbal tea market and I have introduced many a friend and family member to the complex flavors and balance that Bengal Spice offers.No matter the season, this blend carries its own weight, on ice in the summer, warm in the winter, it dares to be disliked. The simple packaging lends to the good-feeling of this treat and always makes me wonder why I ever buy the cheap stuff. Enjoy, this is truly a nectar of the gods, you won't be disappointed."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Pleased with purchase. This is my favorite flavor of the Power Bar line, so it's cost effective to buy by the box. Shipping was quick, would recommend this vendor again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have tried many Balance Bar flavors, and Mocha Chip is one of my favorites. It has a great chocolatey taste which satisfies my sweet tooth while still being healthier than a chocolate bar. Keeps me full, too.Amazon shipped it quickly, and the item arrived fresh and undamaged."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"Love this coffee. It is very tasty. I just wish it made a bigger cup of coffee with one pod. I can get a pretty tasty 6-8 ozs with one. Any bigger and the coffee just taste watery.The first box I receieved was the wrong coffee, Amazon sent me the right coffee very quickly, with out any hassle. Very good customer service."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,"Have'a chips are the best my family ahs ever had. My two children prefer them over all other chips to iclude Doritos and cheetos. The best part about that is that there are no extras one the chips. Just lime, soy sauce and a little salt. Delicious!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I abosolutely LOVE this eye pillow. I purchased the sage green satin/velet one a few months ago, and just purchased another for a friend for Christmas! Above and beyond the quality of the pillow, it even comes with a wonderful pretty box in which you can store it. I can't say enough good things about this eye pillow. The pillow has a wonderful scent, and what is great about it, is that it has a zipper where you can actually either add more filling (I added some lavender seeds that I had for extra fragrence, although it had plenty to begin with!) and you can also remove filling and wash the fabric. The satin side is my favorite, nice and cool on the eyes, while the velvet side is warmer and more cozy. The pillow has plenty of weight to it, so it sits nicely on your face and is big enough to block out the light completely. Sometimes when I fall asleep with it on, it does fall off when I turn, but I usually enjoy just having it on my pillow for the wonderful scent it gives off! Do yourself a favor, and buy this eye pillow!"
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk substitutes,5.0,"I have been drinking Rice Dream for at least 15 years. For those of us who don't consume dairy products, this product is the best. Also the small 8 ounce boxes are hard to find in the grocery store and if you do find them they are usually very pricey. Great price here at Amazon and very fast shipping."
health personal care,health care,allergy,2.0,"I tried this product because a friend highly recommended it for sore throats. I used it once and could tell it would be helpful. BUT after using it I became extremely dizzy - this lasted about 10 hours, diminishing as time went on. I also felt nauseous and very hot and my face became flushed and heated. This was after just one spritz! I looked up the ingredients and found that PEG-40 (hydrogenated) castor oil, when in vapor or finely-misted, causes dizziness and nausea (as well as eye irritation). It is rated as moderately to highly hazardous by the Environmental Working Group. So this could be a good product but I would recommend avoiding it unless the PEG-40 castor oil is taken out. I really did feel extremely sick and wish I hadn't tried it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,I purchased this for a trek on Kilimanjaro. I found the taste to be repulsive. I was disappointed in the product. I don't believe it delivered on what it claimed it could do.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I purchased these Cashews as a Christmas gift. When I went to wrap them (5 days later), I noticed they were a month beyond the freshness expiration. I took them back to the store for an exchange (a 30 mile round trip to the mall and a wasted hour of my time). The clerk went through the shelf stock and at least 90% were out of date. She finally found one that was still fresh and exchanged the cashews. I didn't hang around to see if the out of date stock went back on the shelf, but I think it's inexcusable to sell old merchandise and I'm seeing it more and more at retail shops.This company used to be more quality conscious, but after this experience, I cannot recommend them."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,I use a mask every night as our room sees sun very early. This mask is by far the best I have ever used from both a comfort and light exclusion viewpoint. The indentations for your eyes means there is no contact and you can open your eyes and not even touch the mask with your eyelashes. The elastic is well done and well placed for comfort and does not touch my ears.

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"Love these strips- We were going to start trying in a few months, and I have irregular cycles, so I wanted to see when I ovulated. I got my first ""true"" positive on CD 17 (lines matched), we had sex on CD 20, thinking it might be too late but who knows, and I got pregnant! Guess I didn't need 40, but oh well, they were cheap! Also, the pregnancy test worked just as well as my early detection brand name test did...I had both on hand, and they were both positive at about 10 dpo. Baby is due August 4th! Just fyi, you'll need a little dixie cup or something to hold the urine- its not a ""mid stream"" test. Follow the directions!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,4.0,"I got these for convenience, and because it has no MSG. I found after following the directions the noodles weren't done enough for my taste. I added 1/4 cup of water, 2 T of olive oil and a tablespoon of tahini. I then cooked it on high in my 600-watt microwave for 2 more minutes, all the water absorbed, and it was just right. I think next time I won't use quite all the sauce as it seemed a little overpowering.I thought it made a nice full serving for lunch or a quick snack. With the amendments, this is a product I will buy again. I like the fact that the packaging is all biodegradable."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"We kicked chemicals about two years ago, and since the microwave popcorn is so full of toxic junk, it went out the door with the rest of the other stuff. As other reviewers stated, the kernels are smaller but they pop up to the same size as other popcorn. I use a Pop Lite air popper and I've never had an issue. Very few unpopped kernels and the half-popped ones are edible. I melt some of my homemade sweetcream butter made with raw heavy cream (it's indescribably delicious) and I sprinkle some mild Himalayan pink salt over it. Once that's all tossed together, it's the best popcorn I've ever had. When we go to the movies my kids beg me to smuggle in a bag of this stuff instead of buying the gross over-oiled, heavily salted, fake-buttered movie theater popcorn. I wish I'd been using this popcorn for all the years I used the microwave stuff. Ah well, lesson (eventually) learned."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"Ive had the vanilla, chocolate mint, and double chocolate. this one taste the worst of the three. Protein is probably good for you but this taste really bad. Ive had the costco brand chocolate protien shake and that taste better than this."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"I bought these for my baby when she was 9 months old because she loved to feed herself. Cheerios were too small & easily fell out so we put cheesy bunnies in these cups. At first, she didn't like sticking her hand through the opening but soon figured out that if she pushes the sides down, the opening becomes bigger -- of course, this also means more snacks come spilling out... I definitely don't use these in the car b/c that's just a massive spillage waiting to happen. My major complaint with these are the lids. They got loose after a couple of month and eventually got to a point where they were barely closing. My baby also figured out how to chew on the lid to pop them open very quickly. So I made the switch to Snack Catchers by Munchkin and am so much happier!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Delicious stuff. No Joke. i actually like this tea..i'm not exactly a tea drinker, but i drink it at least one thing of tea a day..mainly cause of the benifits long and short term. I'm not as lazy as i used to be, n i just feel 100% more ALIVE lol..yea i'm kinda being overdramatic, but i can't get enough. i learned a lot about this stuff from my health class in college. the blend of GREEN and WHITE tea is AMAZING FOR YOUR HEALTH!! if u googled the benifits of green and/or white tea u'd definitely wanna get some of this stuff for urself! ;P"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This is the best heating pad I've ever found. It heats up very quickly, under a minute. The heat is distributed evenly and this size is plenty big.I had one before and it did stop working. Calling/writing their customer support yielded no response so don't expect to get great customer service from TheraTherm but it was good enough that I purchased a second one. I believe the first one lasted 2-3 years and was well worth the money, I used it very frequently, packed it on trips, etc.Pros:Heats up quickly, digital thermostat, large sizeCons:Does go past the level you have set and then cools offControls do not retain settings through power loss"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"We buy several flavors of McDougall's soups for winter outdoor activities. These are absolutely the greatest. They taste great, easy to carry in a backpack, no meat or dairy (vegan) and are ready in about 5 min after adding hot water.Perfect for skiing!!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,1.0,There was no way I could get the list of the ingredients on this product before I bought it so took my chances.When it arrived I was really disappointed to see Whey on the list of ingredients because I am a vegan and I don't do dairy. So the stuff sits on my desk waiting for someone to come along and take it off my hands. What a waste of money. Show your ingredients on your amazon listing for heavens sake.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"No-xplode is great for a pre workout drink. I have been using it off and on for years now. I workout in the evening and i have to drink it in the afternoon otherwise it keeps me up too late. It doesn't make me jittery or wired feeling, but it seems to keep me from falling asleep. As far as workout goes though i can workout longer and slows down the lactic acid burn."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Most betaine / HCL will either come in a gel capsule, and not smell, or be coated in something to mask the smell. whatever the coating is with this product, there is no masking the smell. The smell is horrible, stays on your hands, and lingers for minutes.These definitely get the job done, but as a regular betaine user, I have put these in one of our vehicles for 'just in case' use when we are out and about. I cannot stand the smell on a regular use basis."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"Working as a paramedic and dealing with patients in less than stellar conditions I have come to appreciate the ease and ""relative"" accuracy of a temporal thermometer. No it is not as accurate as a rectal temp, but if you use them enough you get used to the variation versus rectal. Most people are only using it to get a good idea, not an exact number, and this gives you just that. Compared to the tympanic - this is light years ahead and much more consistent. Before purchasing I read a review from a ""Med Student"" who blasted it. Obviously he hasn't spent any time in a hospital where they are using them on nearly every patient that comes in the door. If it comes up with a reading that is febrile or hypothermic - then they do a rectal/core temperature. Whether you are at home or in the back of my ambulance - this is a great product for the price."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"Ricola's Honey Herb cough drops are the only product I turn to, now, when I get a sore throat. I've tried other products--such as halls--and while they helped my sore throat, I just couldn't bear the taste. This product, on the other hand, is truly delicious without being overly sweet. The fresh taste of the mint is mellowed nicely by the honey.So, if you are tired of other products' tastes but still want all of the throat soothing power, I recommend Ricola's Honey Herb cough drops."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"Hexane is a cheap solvent, by product of gasoline refining which you will find in soy isolate-concentrate-protein. Soy has only 5 amino acids as Unflavored Whey Protein Isolate has all 9 amino acids. I purchased one bag of this and after further research will stick to Whey Isolate. I consume plenty of none GM, organic soy milk to prepare my organic coffees. If you want to get all nine amino acids without resorting to any animal product then the only one out there is a quinoa which I consume often. I consume soy milk every single day and I am happy with the organic soy milk without any additives so there is no reason for me to consume an incomplete protein product with hexane. Unflavored Whey Protein Isolate is the best priced product out there when it comes to pure protein and nothing else can match for every gram of protein that I get for every single penny that I spend on this protein. No additives, no sweeteners, no chemicals... only pure protein. Whey protein either concentrate or isolate, is the by-product of cheese industry. Years ago the processors were dumping this goodness in the ocean which required them to find an alternative. Whey is the complete protein when making cheese. I consume isolate not concentrate before and after my heavy workouts since in average, human body can not absorb more than 30gr of protein at a time. Unflavored Protein Isolate mixes easily with my organic soy milk without any electrical mixer and tastes just fine. Unflavored Protein Isolate is absorbed in the body within first hour in comparison to Protein Concentrate which takes few hours. Majority of the brands add additives, coloring, sweeteners and chemicals. That is the reason why many producers sell Protein Concentrate not Isolate and majority sell flavored not unflavored. I consume organic yoghurt at night after my workouts so protein is consumed by the body during sleep in few hours. I mix the isolate with un-hulled organic sesame seed, flax seed, cocoa and soy milk. I can not grind sesame seed in the grinder since it is so oily and ruins the grinder and for that flax seed is the best balancer. I grind only for one week at a time and keep it in a sealed glass container in freezer. I consume seeds due to the high mineral content which is a necessity for my healthy diet. Education is the best tool of all. I Read the ingredients and insure that any ingredient that I consume is needed by my body before consumption. There are many different approaches out there when it comes to a diet. Any unwanted ingredient is damaging to my liver even water since it means more work for my liver. The trick is to find the right balance so I can do the sports that I love and to enjoy those sports.I have real researched and experiment many different routs to get protein since I do not consume chicken or beef, only small fish. In regard to protein, I used to purchase 5 lb container but now I purchase 10 lb bags and my experience has proven to me;1. AMOUNT"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This variety of Celestial Seasonings is my very first choice for a (Keurig) K-Cup tea. Just spicy enough to be flavorful without being overpowering. And the orange flavor is very tasty!
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I don't always use this because I nurse in many different places, but this has been used many times on both my children. I keep it in my daughter's room currently since that is where I nurse her the most. Eases my arms and makes the baby very comfortable."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have used this product for 15 years and it is outstanding. The mystery to me is why people continue to buy the usual anti-perspirants and deodorants that only last a day. For me, Lavilin lasts 4-7 days. Imagine going off for a long weekend and not having to worry about stinking pits if you don't get a shower every day. Plus I have never had any rash or irritation from Lavilin. I have sensitive skin, and had problems for years before I switched to Lavilin. While the price may seem a little high, you need to factor in that you will use so little, a container lasts about a year."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I find this product very useful. I definitely know when I have run out of it, well my body just doesn't feel or act the same. It helps keep things regular, cuts down on gasiness. Just a great overall product to use daily."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,3.0,"Got this to go along with the Maxi-Matic 4oz machine. It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged. I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty. Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love this product because it not only helps boost my HDL cholesterol, but it also helps keep eczema at bay for my very sensitive skin. Despite what one may have heard about cod liver oil, the taste is very light and not at all distasteful."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Has anyone noticed this item has stopped working? I believe this is ever since they've added the ""Cellulase"" enzyme. I did some research online and Cellulase is not a naturally occurring enzyme in the body. It digests/breaks down fiber, actually lowering the fiber content of the fiber it's taken with. Clearly some people are less sensitive to this, but for those of us who have taken the supplement for a while and noticed a change, it's very frustrating."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Bob's tapioca is great! Fresh and at a great price. One problem was that Amazon said this was free shipping. Not so. Something to do with the checkout process, something they won't have to worry about. Twas my last order with them."

It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best.

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I was bit by a spider about 5 days ago- I started to get worried because the affected area looked like it was beginning to get worse. I've cleaned it daily with antiseptic wash, used hydro-cortisone cream, and took pain killers to help it along- all to no avail. The area was still feverish to the touch, hard, aching, and swollen. Last night I put some Prids on it and all night long, the area was burning and stinging. By morning, I had some disgusting fluids coming out of the area and now all the swelling is gone! The area is no longer hot to the touch or painful. I'm amazed by this little tin of all natural goodness & plan to always keep it in the medicine cabinet."

I like the variety of instruments the band employs(violin,banjo,steel guitar & sitar etc) are some of the instruments used in the cigarettes & carrot juice collection.Even though I only heard my second CVB track when I bought this collection in late 2010, It does'nt really matter as unique, lively & colorful music such as this loses nothing over time.Don't know if they have ever toured Australia,but it would definitely be on my list."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"From the beginning it felt like it was getting hotter than it should, even on the lowest setting. The controller would get hot, too. We should have stopped using it and taken it back, but we didn't. About the 2nd or 3rd day of use, it actually got so hot it melted itself, the pillow cases, pillows, blankets, sheets, mattress cover and part of the mattress before my girlfriend could get it unplugged. Thank God all those items are made of flame-retardant materials. The house could have burned down and she could have been hurt or killed."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

This has little bumps that fit in just the right place along the occipital area of my neck, and the pressure in the right place relieves pain within 10 minutes. It works better if I lie on the floor, makes it more stable. I have used it lying in bed, but the soft mattress doesn't provide as much support as the floor. I have had mine for several years and I bought this one for my niece who has also had a neck fusion. I highly recommend it."

It did not stay in place well, and needed to be constantly tugged back in to position to keep my cleavage covered. Once I managed that, my sides and back would be exposed. I was uncomfortable using it even at home around our older children - I certainly wouldn't take it out in public.

My friend said that Primal Defense Ultra really worked for her. It kept her regular and feeling great. I do not put a lot of stock in these types of things and at first I just ignored her advice. I guess I complained to her about my problem again,because she told me I really should try this Primal Defense Ultra. So I did and it worked fabulous on me. I do not have constipation any more,I am regular, and feeling great. It took about 2 days for it to start effecting me. My friend said it took a week for her to start feeling the good results."

I wouldn't recommend this flavor but I would recommend the product (I thought it would taste more like veggie than dip... my mistake). My 5 year old eats them better than the babies. The whole family likes the taste of the cheese ones, they taste like cheese puffs. I will stick with the cheese next time.Good finger food, but watch your baby if they don't chew well.

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,2.0,"I thought this product would work better but my 22 month old just takes the juice box out of it defeating the whole purpose of it. Also, it is a bit on the large size so it works only with the really big juice boxes. I only buy the 4 ounce juice boxes and this container is too big for it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I don't really know how to correctly rate this product. It arrived when they said it would. However, my husband has only been taking them for a month and has not been tested again, so we don't know if his count has gone up.Also, we have not had a ""chance"" to get pregnant since he's been taking them, so I can't review this item correctly yet. I do know that my husband has felt healthier since taking them. He usually gets colds very easily, but recently was able to fight one off and I got it. It usually works the opposite away around!After two more months I will get back on this website and review this product again."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"Have you been to the edge of eternity? Well I have, and it is Sedona Suite.I love this album. From the soothing synthesizer to the feeling of resentment and muted joy comparable to what I get when I look at wedding notices in the local paper, this album delivers more than UPS on a substitute federal holiday that isn't observed by private industry. As we near the 20th anniversary of this album's release, I can comfortably say no other album has captured the beauty of Yavapai and Coconino counties as this wonderful track set--so, so completely.Wikipedia calls Tom Barabas ""This article may not meet the notability requirements for music,"" but I think Sedona Suite is the most notable piece of easy listening jam I've had since I put that orange marmalade in my ear last Christmas.My favorite track has to be Suite Memories. It reminds me of my ""suite"" memory--the time I went with my youth pastor to a 4H fair in Branson, MO where in a somewhat inappropriate way I learned how to bribe a desk clerk and reroute an IP address.Is this making sense?Look, life is a mystery, and so is beauty"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Irwin Natural's ""Ginkgo Smart"" has many healthful ingredients, including a fish oil base, but contains Vinpocetine, which is a periwinkle extract that might induce side effects such as reduced immune function and depleted catecholamine levels leading to depression (see wikipedia's Vinpocetine article).For a standardized extract containing both the 24% Ginkgo Flavonglycosides and the 6% Terpene Lactones, along with other brain nutrients, one might investigate Karuna's ""MemoRegen"", or Source Natural's ""Ginkgo-24"", or Allergy Research's ""Complex-M w/ Ginkgo"", or Life Extension's ""Super Booster"".GINKGO REVIEWED...THE BAD"
health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"About the Pain - Like anything that can cause discomfort, each person's individual pain threshold will determine how something like this affects them. I probably fall some where in the middle, so the pain was definitely intense, but didn't last too long, and would have been worth it if it had done anything...About the Relief - Unfortunately, the relief was non-existent for me. Admittedly, I have chronic sinus issues, but this product did nothing at all for me. If it helped at all, it would only provide relief for a minute or two. Most often, not even that. I have tried it off and on for a month or so and have finally given up that it would ever give me any relief under any condition, even when i'm just slightly stuffy."

At restaurants the tray allowed us to feed her without having to worry about crud, germ infested tabletops. For travel it folded small and was great to leave in the car for grandma's house. We then started to use it as a booster seat at home. Of all baby items i have purchased this is the one that we used until the bitter end. This is my first pick going forward for anyone whom is pregnant."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"We have used 10 pounds of this flour. Cakes, brownies, muffins, breading mix, all worked well. Served all the above to guests and none could tell it was gluten free. Bread still comes out denser than regular wheat flour, but changes to the recipes and baking are getting us closer.This is the 5th flour we have tried, and will be sticking with this one from now on."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I usually don't have the time to review products but i had to set out time to put in this review. i bought this product based on other peoples review and i'm glad i did. i have been using it for a week and all the scaly dryness on my face is all gone. for some reason it did not work to well on my scalp probably because i used it in combination with something else but it worked great on my skin. i don't my the smell, i'm just happy about the results. you just saved me hundreds of dollars that i would have spent seeing a dermatologist."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I received my order in a timely manner. The quality of this product is excellent. I would strongly suggest purchasing this product and I plan to purchase more.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,I went against the poor reviews when I ordered this product for two reasons
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"product does not really glow in the dark. It did for a while, but they should probably be under lighted conditions for at least a day before use."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Having tried many different ways to make wholesome shakes, I landed up on the Ultimate Meal. After seeing it at Whole Foods, I was curious and bought the smaller container at first.The green makes it interesting and a little bland at first .. and then you improvise with different fruits and such. Before you know it, you are hooked, not because of it's taste but because of what it does for your body. I have one in the morning and I am stuffed till about noon. Going on a slow roll weight loss plan, this is a great addition to my diet.I have grown to like it a lot .. with a banana, apple, pears, honey dew or whatever other fruit I can lay my hands on. I have been recommending this to many of my friends who are 'growing' to like it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I tried this out because I was having trouble with a dry mouth. It worked. It has an odd flavor but not obnoxious, kind of citrus. I would buy it again."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I bought these for my eighteen month old since we use chopsticks a couple times a week and he was always reaching for ours. He loves them, such a great find! They are a well designed and will continue to grow with him as his skills improve. He has shown no signs of frustration when attempting to eat with them even though they are more difficult than using a spoon or fork. He is so happy to have his very own set of chopsticks. I highly recommend these over any other design."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,The instructions are horrible. The product is okay. It feels nice but the ends are a bit harsh on the scalp. May not be used very long before uncomfortable enough to stop. Scalp stings for awhile after use.
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,3.0,"I have a g-tube so all my meds have to be crushed to fit through the tubing. I have literally worn out pill crushers. I got this one thinking it would be easier on my hands to use since I take 40 pills a day. The top half is easy to grip but the bottom half hurts my hands to hold. The sharp edges/ridges on the bottom really cut into my hand. Why didn't the top design and materials get repeated on the bottom? Also, the internal action of the crusher doesn't crush the pills completely. The several times I have tried I have ended up pouring the pieces into my old worn out crusher to finish the job. I can't believe there isn't a crusher out there that works, is durable and is easy to grip. This one almost got it half right."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,2.0,"I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase."

I just opened a new bottle no fizzy. Wonder if that does mean they are dead..."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I received this for Christmas and I love it!! I have used some other bottle warmers at friends' houses but I like this one the best so far. Originally I wanted the avent IQ, but since you have to close the top, only my avent bottles would fit in that warmer. I have avent, Dr. browns, and playtex ventaire both standard and wide! So I needed a versatile warmer and this one is just that! All my bottles fit. The only thing I don't like about this product is filling the water cups and dumping them in, the avent fills for you... I noticed there is a version of this bottle warmer without the cooler that fills for you. But as far as a gift goes, I am very happy with this one. I just fill both cups and leave them hooked on the warmer to use later. You do have to read the chart and make sure you are putting in the right amount of water according to the bottle and volume of milk you are warming. Its not very difficult to figure out since the chart is also printed right on the side of the warmer. I really wish I had this during those middle of the night feedings when my baby was still sleeping in my room!! I don't really need the cooler now that my baby is 6 months old. But its still great to have for next baby! :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Among a large selection of vitamins, this was the most economical and was a true value based on other websites."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My nutritionist recommended this for me to take 2 before every meal and I don't go anywhere without it! I am very senstive to many foods including dairy, soy, wheat and corn--these are often hidden in many foods and we eat them unknowingly especially when we eat at restaurants--I feel so much better with these and they certainly help !!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,This is the best lube I have ever used. a little goes further than any other i've come across. clean up also takes less time and effort. to top it off its slickest too. so in every aspect this lube out performs any that i have used. slightly more odor than some of the other odorless ones i've used but you dont smell a thing after clean up unlike a few other odorless. i am overly sensitive to smells though so i it's likely you wont smell a thing.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We go through a ton of bottles a day with the twins. We use glass and plastic doc brown bottles. Because it's shape is round you have to balance the glass bottles evenly on each side. The top is perfect for all the parts to the doc brown bottles. We've been using this for almost 4 months (so yes, we are in the big glass bottles) and it's still holding up great. We originally had some flimsy rack my husband picked up one night on the way home which was horrible. Love the way the water drains off so your bottles aren't sitting in water and ick. Definitely a fan of this!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Maybe a one-star rating isn't fair for a product I never tried, but I couldn't get this thing back in its plastic wrapper fast enough lest the perfumed, ""aromatherapy"" odor overwhelm my home. I imagine that in the middle ages they must have doused themselves with this sort of stuff to conceal body odor and onion breath. The emergency maneuver I performed to stuff the thing back in its bag, the bag in the box and the box in the mail could easily have made my back even worse, but it would have been in a good cause. I think I've made myself clear.If you don't have any sense of smell--who knows?--this thing, whose size and shape is a great idea, might actually work."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,It would be so helpful to know the nutritional content and what is considered a typical serving size. Does anyone know where to get this info?
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This kit forms an outstanding foundation to your lightweight emergency survival pack. The contents are high quality and thoughtfully prepared, and the whole thing is silly-inexpensive for what you get. Indeed, anyone would be hard-pressed to assemble a comparable kit for the price. Given the cost, size, and quality of this mini-survival kit, there really isn't any reason you shouldn't have one of these on your person every time you lace up your hiking boots. You don't need to be a survivalist to recognize the value of preparedness, and this kit is a great way to start if you are even remotely likely to be stuck in the woods, lost on the trail, injured, or otherwise in need of a rescue in the backcountry.The kit contains items that can provide for your rescue (signal mirror, whistle), food (through snares and/or fishing), heat, shelter, and more, and it all comes in a reasonably waterproof bag that will fit in your shirt pocket. Chances are, you will never need it. If you do, it is likely to make you much more comfortable at a minimum, and may very well save your life. Any student of outdoor survival or disaster preparedness should have one of these. I have two"

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,1.0,"I was looking for something quick and healthy-but after seeing that each cookie has 22 grams of sugar, I was appalled that it was called ""healthy""! We aren't supposed to have more than 15 grams of sugar for a whole day, and this had 22 grams per cookie! Ugh! Pureed prune, evaporated cane juice, and more, made it very Unhealthy. Healthy would be stevia (which also lowers your blood pressure) and xylitol as they have a ""zero"" count for sugar but taste sweet. Sucralose is Splenda and is really bad for your body as it contains chlorine, and can damage your organs and reproductive functions. If stevia or xylitol was used, you'd definitely have another customer. :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"This product arrived 24 packs in a box. Two packs had leaks which caused a big mess upon opening. The damaged packs were identified and discarded. The clean up required gallons of water as the sticky gel surrounding most of the packs had to be washed thoroughly. I cannot imagine how the damaged packs could have been opened enroute, so the shipment must have left the dealer broken. Lesson learned, never buy bulk through the mail. It is too tempting for a unscrupulous dealer to unload damaged goods. So I saved nothing over retail cost by buying from this source. BTW"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"I stumbled across this chip when a friend of mine gave me a bag along with some other items for a holiday gift. After going through the bag, I had to find more. It's not easy to find a really tasty and relatively healthy snack such as these chips! They don't have too much fat so calorically, they aren't too bad, as far as chips go.I really like the taste and I bought a case of them...will gladly buy more when I run out. Try these...you'll like them!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"Odor is overwhelming. Might be a good product, but didn't get past the smell. You wouldn't want to be around people after application."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These bars are delicious, nutritious (as far as processed food goes, anyway), and reasonably priced here on Amazon (especially if you use the ""subscribe & save"" option)."
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,hated these. no support for my arches or heels at all. save your money. I guess maybe it is a bonus how small they are so they will fit in small shoes. But i need real support and these just didnt do anything. I found them uncomfortable too. Dont recommend them.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,4.0,"This is a wonderful item. However, if you search carefully, you'll see a similar product for less money. I ordered both items and they were the exact same thing --- except one was $12.95 and the other was $9.70. Both were just what I needed/wanted. They protect and launder beautifully."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,Been wearing this for about 3 weeks now for 12 hours a day. It is still sticky but alot of lint from my clothes is on it and wont wash out. I am pretty sure my huge scar on my right side from skin removal surgery is getting lighter. It is a 2 year old scar that had the stitches burst open after surgery. So it was very wide and dark and long. I regret not taking a picture for before to compare to the 3 month mark they recommend. Also if i get another for my other surgery scars I will also buy the cream to help speed things up.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"If you're like me, you are tired of the long list of ingredients in creams that you can't pronounce. I just wanted something pure and natural yet effective. I really like this, my skin soaks it up. It's a great moisturizer."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,These bars are very good. I eat one for breakfast every morning. I have tried all the slim fast bars and most of the special k bars and this is the only one that doesn't have a yucky aftertaste.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,I am very pleased with this product. I only wish that I had known about it and purchased it earlier.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I'm grateful for DIM because it really does take away my hot flashes which helps me to get a better nights sleep. But note that it most likely won't work overnight I suspect for most people. You have to give it a few days to a few weeks to kick in. For me DIM takes about a week and a half to start working again if I stop taking it for a while. Overall good product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I just finished taking this along with the Blessed Thistle and it did nothing for me. All 100 pills, nothing. I guess everyting doesn't work for everybody. It's okthough, because I will stop nursing my daughter when she's six months anyways. In about a month. I did like the fact that I smelled like maple syrup. Weird, but true"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I bought these softgels as a supplement, and was specifically excited about the ZMA in it because I wanted to improve my muscle recovery time. After 2 weeks of taking 2 a day, I noticed no difference in how i felt or in my soreness. However, whenever I took it, a few hours later I would have a bad taste in my mouth. I stopped taking them because there was no point. I'm giving them 2 stars because they are what they claim to be and delivery of them was prompt, but they didn't do anything noticeable for me."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"These bars are yummy. With the mango and pineapple bars, you can't taste the fruit, but you can definitely taste the almond flavor in these bars. Be advised that there are no visiable almonds, only almond flavoring. This bar is chewy with sweetened dry shredded coconut with almond flavoring. Also don't put these in the refrigerator as they will get super hard."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"The product is for more than just bowel movements, it is relatively gentle, and gives you more energy and a clearer head, as well as better digestion and less discomfort if you've had your fill of bad holiday food and alcohol.I take it once or twice a year to clear the pipes and my system of pollutants and toxins from food, alcohol etc.., I try to eat relatively clean and organic, but also have guilty pleasures that I try to moderate (french fries or pizza, beer, once or twice a week). I exercise regularly and sweat a lot when I do, to clean my system out as well.So, the effects of this product aren't uncomfortable or drastic for me, once the herbs build-up in my system, they start to work over time, and I've never really noticed any adverse side effects.ONLY take these successively for no more than 30 days, for others 2 weeks is plenty, 2 in the AM, 2 in the PM.IF you have been eating fast food, not exercising, smoke or drink, etc.., for a long time and have never done a cleanse before, or haven't in a long, long time, yes, you may experience side effects such as temporary acne or constant bowel movements, etc..., I think that is expected and something you might be best getting through, then changing some lifestyle habits if you're concerned."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"I ordered the canister of strawberry-banana after trying it in a sample pack (the sample was very good, strong distinct strawberry and banana flavors) but what came was very bland, almost no flavor at all. very disappointing."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"It's OK but we only use it for water because it leaks more than a bottle. It's also quite heavy for my 11 month old to handle, even nearly empty. Also the plastic parts cannot be entirely removed. If you want to use it like a cup, there's a plastic ring around the edge. I recommend the Safe Sippy over this, by far. The Safe Sippy isn't insulated, but frankly my baby doesn't care about that."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,5.0,"Transformed my life! I won the junior UFC nano weight division title after drinking 5 gallons of Tuscan whole milk (though nearly did get disqualified because of the weight gain, a quick wet burp before the weigh in took care of that).Emboldened after the fight, with a Tuscan 1 gallon milk jug in hand, I headed out to the Vegas clubs and bumped (and burped) into Megan Fox. I'd like to think that I have massive python biceps and I tucked her up against my chest (sort of like those romance novel covers)...but really my scrawny arms barely blocked the martini glass she hurled in my direction. Then her twin beefy body guards grabbed my shoulders with their pinkies (ouch!) and much to my surprise instead of being pummeled flat into the ground (nodding towards the Tuscan milk jug) they casually spun me around and slipped me into Megan's embrace.Needless to say my stomach did a flip flop and up chucked a Tuscan cheese ball that landed dead center in her cleavage. Instead of the anticipated crotchgrabandtwist move she plucked the aforementioned cheese ball from her decolletage and plopped into her mouth. Her eyes (they're pretty big to begin with) exploded with delight, she grabbed me by the collars, wedging the Tuscan milk jug between us and proceeded to lambada me to her limo.Well, needless to say a private ""party"" ensued at her secluded Vegas residence. Thank goodness for Tuscan milk - it kept the mojo going on. Now two years later, I'm still going strong. Yeah, I'm locked up in Megan's Vegas condo, have to do the whole milkman thing, but hey - I'm not complaining - I get to hold her milk jugs every morning. Thanks Tuscan Whole Milk!"

As a result, I have been dealing with the pain of plantar fasciitis that is minor in one foot, but it has me limping, at times, with the other. Anyone with PF knows the tenderness experienced with those first morning steps, particularly after a hard workout the previous day. It is not pleasant!After reading the recommendations for the Tuli's heel cups, I immediately ordered a pair. I have given them an adequate therapeutic trial, moving them between several pair of my favorite athletic shoes. So far, I have not found a single pair of my shoes, that fit properly when adding these heel cups. The heel cups raise my heel in the foot-bed, to the point that the shoe hits too low on the heel. The result"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,I thought that this would be an amazing product. I had tried one at a party that was non motorized and I wish I would've saved my money from this purchase. The motor is too strong and it feels like a jack hammer on top of your head and the 'arms' are so stiff quite honestly- it just plain hurts. I now will be spending extra $$ to get the plain old fashioned $2 non motorized version.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,baby formula,2.0,"The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less. Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can. Each can was different. The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price. The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,"My husband LOVES this lemony marmalade!! He used to be able to find it in stores, but they don't seem to carry it anymore so I'm thrilled to be able to find it online. A few jars of Silver Shred are one of his favorite Christmas presents every year."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have used this product for a couple year now and love it. In fact, instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with my coffee in the morning and enjoy it more then the mocha's I was getting at well-known coffee places. I used to by this product at a couple stores who longer carry it, which was really frustrating. Being able to buy it online is great!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,This product is an awesome help for those suffering from IBS... it really made a difference along with eating the foods that I know are good for me...and avoiding the bad. I used to have tremendous pains and this product almost eliminated that.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I love smooth moves, it works for me overnight without the harness of a laxative. I drink it after dinner with a night time snack and it works great for me."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I really like this lotion primarily because it does not contain peppermint like most foot rub/creams. It has a very nice scent, not overpowering. I use this as a foot rub treat after running. I wear socks overnight after using this lotion and my feet are nice, soft and refreshed in the morning."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I gave this as a gift and they have been completely in love with this thing. They have had no problems with it. So I can't complain.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I've been drinking Lyons tea ever since my trip to Ireland in 2006! It is Ireland's everyday tea and I love the flavor! I also like the fact that you don't have to steep this tea and it tastes amazing! I've bought this as a gift for many of my friends here in the States and they all love it! The pyramid bags are a definite plus for that special flavor that only the Irish can bring!!! Eat your hearts out England!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"These are ok B12's. A little slow to dissolve, but not bad, especially for the price. Has a mild taste, which I like."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've bought this brand of tea before and all of them have been good quality.

This bilberry tea has a mild, pleasant flavor...kind of like a mild blueberry flavor. Bilberry is known to be very good for the eyes, which is why I drink it...plus it is a good taste too. :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"The cookie dough flavor is okay, but not the best. The texture is a little too gooey. I have only eaten a few of these bars and I am already sick of them. I got them the same time as I got some Clif bar White Chocolate Macadamia, and those are by far superior to the balance bar.Hopefully the other flavors are better than this, but I think for now I will stick with Clif bars."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"i have been enjoying these delicious and healthy Barry's Bakery French Twists for a number of years.I was able to, once upon a time, purchase this product in Walgreen's, until they suddenly stopped stocking/selling them.

My favorite flavors are the original and the raspberry.Enjoy a few Barry's Bakery French Twists, when you need/want a light snack that is sweetly satisfying.And,,,,,,,they are great for those who, like me, enjoy dunking their edibles in some tea or coffee, even hot cocoa.something yummy, healthy, and without the guilt..."

It's a bizarre nub of a bar - I actually LAUGHED when I shook it out of the package, it was so ridiculously small. As for the taste... it's chocolatey, not totally unpleasant...but DRY...like the Sahara desert dry...like there's not enough milk in the world to wash it down dry...like I'd tell you how dry it is but my mouth is too gummy and I may be trying to swallow it until 2099 so I can't talk. If you have allergies and can't have gluten (like me) you'd be better off eating a piece of chalk and a spoonful of cocoa than this. Skip it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I take one a day and NEVER get sick. Amazing because I have ALWAYS caught everything that came along and when I catch a cold, it is a one month ordeal where I cough continuously. I had whooping cough a few years ago, before I discovered elderberry, and coughed for five months and developed pleurisy which is extremely painful. I told a friend my problem with my immune system and she said I needed elderberry capsules so I started taking one per day. After a year or so, I told her that was the best advice I had ever received and I take one a day without failure. She said, No, you are only supposed to take them when you feel a cold coming on. But this works for me so I continue with one a day...I may be on Medicare, but I do not want to be sick."

But since I was using this on a carpet, I wasnt worried about the noise. I built it in minutes the casters were already on the base, which is strange because it probably was a returned item. Then I noticed it did not raise up or down and I was kicking myself for buying this piece of junk. I have 6 earthlites at work with no issues, I think I will pay the extra money and get a decentchair I can actually use."

health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,This is the only product so far I have tried that actually decreased my hot flashes. I was not able to get much sleep because at night they were worse. Remifemin worked after just a couple weeks. It decreased my hot flashes significantly. Also with Amazons subsription it is cheaper than Walmarts prices. I did not try the Nightime one because this one worked so well. Great product and great price.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,These definately have a nasty smell when you open the bottle and are giant (probably double the size of my multi-vit) but I have watched my son and fiance get sick multiple times this winter and they haven't passed it onto me like it usually happens. So I defintaley think it has boosted my immune power which is why I got them. Worth adding too your herbal regimen especially during cold and flu season
baby products,feeding,food,4.0,"Some people find cutting/chopping fruits & veggies to be therapeutic, even fun! But not me - I hate that laborious, time-consuming part of cooking. I use the Quick Chef several times a week and it saves me lots of time, besides avoiding the burning tears from raw onions. Just throw in some chunks of onion, bell pepper, celery, etc., and within seconds of turning the handle you can cut everything to whatever size you need, even finely-diced. The booklet tells you basically nothing (just a few recipes), so you'll need to experiment a little. It probably wouldn't work well for potatoes or raw squash, but it's ideal for softer or watery foods...i.e., onions, bell peppers, celery, tomatoes, hard-cooked eggs, cabbage, avocado, parsley and more. I'm sure I'll continue to find more uses for it.Cleaning this thing is a breeze if you rinse it immediately after use - it's effortless. I've never had to put it in the dishwasher. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have ridges inside the bowl. If the four vertical ridges were on the outside instead of the inside, you could wipe it clean with a spatula much more easily. I would also have made the handle (turning crank) a different color from the lid, as a visual reminder to remove it before taking the lid off. The handle, which sits loosely on the top, has bounced on the kitchen floor a couple times, but hasn't cracked. I think the whole unit is well-made for the most part, and the blades are extremely sharp. Plus, it's a bonus to have a kitchen appliance that requires no electricity!The price is steep, but if you shop around (like here on Amazon), you'll find much lower prices than full retail. For a knife-challenged and time-challenged cook like me, the Quick Chef is a godsend!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Like most multi level marketing companys the first thing they need is a quality product. I'm not sure they found one with this product. Unfortunately I fell for the hype surrounding this product. I was feeling a lot better after struggling with candida for eight years. I was taking Candi Gone, probiotics and enzymes as well as a strict candida diet. I added the Fivelac and in three days I started feeling dizzy to the point I thought I was going to pass out. When I called the company the person I was given to talk to (who sounded like a teenage girl) wasn't very helpfull. She said to go from one packet a day to half or go every other day. I think if you have a product that can make someone pass out you'd recommend them to stop taking it! They should at least have some warnings about possible side affects. This product may actually help some but I think that some of the testamonials about this product are made up which is a common practice with a multi level marketing company.I agree with another review ""you can get quality probiotics a lot cheaper at the health food store."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"Ok if you like very mild coffee, please dont bother. But if you like a cup that is going to jump start your braincells in the morning, try it. Next week Amazon is going to send me the 5th batch of this (I subscribe) and just in time too. I use my Rancilio to make 2 double's before I go to the office in the morning and it is very good.

I don't have time and it didn't work after all that work. plus it's scary because it says it will dissolve but it's not as fast as you think.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"Because this got such good reviews, I decided to try it as a substitute for my favorite Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, which has disappeared from my local grocery store. This is some of the worst chai I've ever tasted. It had a very strong artificial vanilla flavor, and none of the after bite that good black teas should have. It was so bad that I could not force myself to finish the box. I do like their classic Constant Comment, but I cannot recommend this Vanilla Chai."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I've purchased most of the MCormick Recipe Inspiration packs at the grocery store and have foound most of them to be very good, especially this Quesadilla Casserole and the Asian Sesame Salmon. The recipe card is included, so after you make it once, you need only have the spices on hand to make it again. This casserole is a favorite with the men in my family. Sometimes certain of the packs aren't available at the store. It would be nice if Amazon would carry these in bulk and with Prime shipping. I was told by a relative who works at McCormick that these recipe inspirations are experimental and so I don't know if they'll be around forever or not. I personally wish they would keep bringing out new recipes."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I have been searching for a couple months for the ""perfect"" cleanse. I've never done one before so I wasn't sure what to look for. I very nearly bought one of the more expensive brands here on amazon, but then found this cleanse at Trader Joes and decided to give it a try since it was only 10 bucks. I decided to take half the dosage. I took 3 pills in the morning and 3 at night, so 6 per day. I thought 12 per day, as recommended, seemed a little extreme to start with. I took the first 3 on a sat night and within a 1/2 hour I had to ""go."" Same thing happened Sunday morning, but the rest of Sunday was uneventful. Monday however, included at leat 6 trips to the bathroom. For the next 5 or 6 days I was ""going"" between 3-5 times every day, and as disgusting as this sounds, what was coming out actually looked old, like it had been in there for quite a while. I was so thankful to have it out and no longer in there. By the time I finished the 10 day treatment, I was amazed at the results. I felt so much cleaner and lighter. I no longer had that heavy, bloated feeling I've had for as long as I can remember. I am not overweight and have always been considered ""skinny,"" but I always feel bloated. I don't think I ever remember a time my stomach was flat. It is now!!! A few people even asked if I had lost weight. I am definitely doing another cleanse before summer and bikini season starts :) I highly recommend this!"

No more diarrhea or gas issues with my IBS cat, I highly recommed this product over the forti flora packets."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,I bought the foot spa for my GF for Xmas. She seems to really be enjoying it.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"My dad used to make creme caramel from scratch and it was a huge hit. I tried this and the taste and texture are surprisingly similar, definitely a good enough substitute for the real thing. The color is a little more custard-y yellow than blonde as I remember my father's version, but that's no big deal. Would be 5 stars if they doubled the amount of caramel sauce included in each box - it's tasty, but there could be more of it!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems. Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing. My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated. For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result. I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep. I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle!I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help. I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable. I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Amazon Prime benefits.To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes. Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit. When I tried my first cup, I hated it. It tasted like musty, minty licorice. I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it. Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay. My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it! I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it!The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes. When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference. I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst. And the next morning? I woke up practically engorged!I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful. Nursing is peaceful once again!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Although the medical industry has a habit of misinterpreting how vitamin c should be taken, I found out that my allergies, colds and overall health has improved dramatically. My wife's allergies have almost disappear completely, and colds are a thing of the past. We don't believe in dumb HN1 flu shots because of the harmful chemicals they place in those shots are much more dangerous to your health than the food you eat at the supermarket (processed foods). Like our great scientist, Linus Pauling, once said"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I have used these bottles with 6 kids of my own now and several that I have watched over the years. I have always thought they were great and the kids loved them too. When my youngest was born in July 2010 we expected another smooth run but after starting out in the NICU with a feeding tube and difficulty keeping food doen due to severe reflux these bottles have proven their worth a thousand times over. The baby gets bestmilk and even occasionally formula in these bottles and both must b thickened with rice cereal for her to keep it down. Withh these bottles we don't have to worry about if she is getting to much air because we can she she isn't getting any. We use the latex Natural Latch nipples in slow flow and don't have any trouble with the ticker liquids clogging up or not coming out easily. And she has no trouble switching between bottle and breast which is a real plus.I highly recomend using these bottle if you breast feed or if your baby has reflux or other tummy troubles.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,oils,4.0,"I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.What to do??I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes ""okay"" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"This coffee tastes very good prepared as espresso, latte or cappuccino; either using the ristretto attachment or the regular length (we didn't like it as lungo... gets weak, but it is a matter of taste, of course).It has a medium roast amber-dark color when brewed and aroma that is very pleasant.It is almost sweet to the taste without extreme accents of bitterness.For people that prefers medium roast over bold toasted. This is a good choice coffee.Brewing using an Illy Francis Francis X1."

Most of the time, the massage therapist could not go deep enough into the ""sweet"" spot. Now, I use this product every day and I can pin point the specific area and press as hard as I want. It is a great design. I study the meridian points and this product has the ability to do 2-3 pressure points at one time. It surely does help blood circulation and the knots on my back are getting smaller. The only limitation of this product is it ""gives"" a little when I press really hard (Sorry, I like deep tissue massage). Overall it is a great product, I spend more time with it than with my husband!!"

I normally marinade for hours and make wings almost nightly for the protein.Long story short, I used this sauce and the first thing I noticed was the rancid smell coming from my oven. I kept trying to tell myself it would taste good, I ended up eating as much as I could of a breast and had to throw away the rest and I also threw away the bottle of Texas Pete's. I was absolutely amazed that a hot sauce could taste so bad when cooked, absolutely the worst sauce I've ever had; stick with Franks Red Hot and Anchor Bar and you'll never be disappointed. If you want more heat at cayenne pepper :)"

This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal."

I was unable to move it for a few minutes and even after that it was stiff. I decided to see a chiropracter. After about 10 visits where she did pressure points my hand was better. Unable to afford regular visits, I was looking for something to help me that I could use myself. The Body Back Buddy is it. I find that if I use it once or twice a day, my fingers loosen up. It is amazing. Who would know that the muscles in my neck and shoulders control my hands and fingers. I will keep using this."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I got this tea to treat my depression and it worked wonderfully! I had one bag a day in the morning and sometimes had another in the evening. I was more productive and I felt happier. I did notice that I became more sensitive to light which is a side effect of using St. Johns' wort, so I'd recommend wearing sun glasses in bright lights and wear protective clothing if you plan be out in the sun for a long period of time.Edit"

These were an instant hit with him as not only are they great tasting but healthy and safe for babies as they melt away in the mouth.

I recently got some Gerber Graduate coupons and combined it with sales and got some great deals.

It is a whole grain-like product, so it has fiber and is very nutritious with a delicious taste. Gluten free, buckwheat, being a plant food, is low in cholesterol and saturated fat. Of course, buckwheat has no trans fats at all. It is also low in sodium. Mineral nutrition includes copper, magnesium, and manganese.

At 24 grams of protein per serving, it's hard to rival as a quick, low-calorie protein source. I've had a few other protein shakes before that were barely palatable, but this shake tastes great and I actually look forward to it. I prepare it with milk and a few ice cubes in the blender. My two teenagers love it and usually have at least one shake/day. Sign up for the auto-ship option-it's a great deal! I laughed when the 5-lb container arrived"

grocery gourmet food,baby food,dinners,4.0,"My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store. The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!"

It's a bit bulky to carry around, and not super easy to set up, but it is OK and it does keep her clean. Before she turned one year old I wasn't comfortable using disinfecting wipes on places she'd touch. Now she's over 1 year I'm finding myself using this less and less, and start to just disinfect the highchair and tabletop with wipes when we go out. So it's a bit shortlived but that's expected with baby products. The color isn't as bright as shown on the picture - the blue is not as vibrant. Overall, this is an OK purchase, and I think it's worth it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,i have weekly migraines and thought this would nip it in the bud. it sounded good but didn't work for me. i have now tried it 5 times...each time at the very first sign of a migraine and it has not helped.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I ordered and received 3 boxes of Think Thin bars,the Chocolate mudslide bars I got were not fresh. The others were good.Maybe because people don't order them as often as other bars - it got old.Since then I have stopped ordering those Chocolate mudslide bars."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Nice dense bread. Great taste. EASY! We use this for sandwiches- buy it by the case. Highly recommend this product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"Until the last jug of this product arrived, I agreed with all of the five star reviews -- but then the company changed the formulation. Here's an e-mail I wrote to the company and their boilerplate response:""BLEH! I've been happily using your Double Rich Chocolate Gold Standard 100% Whey for years but the last jug I bought is awful! At first, I thought there was a mistake in the manufacturing process, and then I noticed that you more than doubled the amount of sodium in the product -- up 117%. Why? Not only is the flavor bad, but many manufacturers are actually reducing the sodium content of products for health reasons. As you must be aware, Americans consume way too much sodium. Surely it's not in your interest to promote hypertension among your customers. I'll be checking out other products the next time I buy.""""Thank you for choosing ON. Yes, you might have noticed changes in sodium and cholesterol levels on the facts panels of Gold Standard 100% Whey. At this time, the formula has not changed, and macronutrient levels of carbs, protein and fats remain exactly the same. Only levels of sodium and cholesterol have changed - and only because we approved new premium raw ingredient suppliers. Optimum has always made a point of accurately reporting the nutrient profile of all protein powders on facts panels. It's part of our uncompromising commitment to superior quality. Making sure that our valued customers are aware of even these small changes is very important to us.Best Regards!Rebecca JohnsenConsumer Affairs RepOptimum Nutrition/American Bodybuilding""The company failed to address the point of concern. The American Heart Association recommends that Americans consume no more than 1500 mg of sodium daily to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease"
health personal care,health care,allergy,1.0,"I love the neti pot and bought this item to store my salt in the bathroom. I paid extra thinking I was getting a container and a scoop. However I only received the jar of salt NO SCOOP. Order was placed through Amazon Prime, other vendors may provide the scoop."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,I bought this as an alternative to Vaseline for my long runs. The Vaseline always seemed to wear out after 10 miles or so. So far this Skin Lube has lasted 18+ with no signs of wearing out.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,3.0,"This coffee produces an extremely mild brew. What you can taste is pretty good, but so faint; it's one step above hot water. Given the price, we won't be ordering again."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,2.0,"The oats don't taste like they are cooked enough, even with milk (or heating with berries.... & then adding milk) this is a tough cereal to choke down. There are slivers of almond in here, but not a lot."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,I don't want people to be fooled by these positive reviews obviously fake. I have used these they simply stink.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,I was disappointed in this product. I bought the non-motorized version and it was good. So I thought this battery operated version would blow me out of the water. Not the case. Just get the non-motorized version (3 for 3.99). You'll get a lot more bangs for your bucks.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Not as sweet as their regular whey but I guess that's the point. I always use in my post-workout shake and it blends very well with no clumps. I really wanted a whey with no ""ose"" in the ingredients and Optimum works for price and quality. Very recommended and zero problems with my order!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"Thid is excellent and easy to make instant soup. I live down the street from a Korean restaurant and their soup is very similar but I like this better with the Udon noodles. Not the cheapest instant soup but very good. The only complaint is the coupons on boxes are expired, the soup is fine till 2013. I hope Annie fixes that problem as a dollar off coupon is good if it isn't expired."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I bought this initially because I have read many wonderful, wonderful things about Life Extension's quality, both in terms of the amounts of vitamins and also in terms of the actual bioavailability of the nutrients. I had been taking a supermarket multi as well as D and B vitamins.When I got this supplement and looked at the amounts my jaw dropped. This multi- not only puts my old multi- to shame (which I expected) but also has 2000 IU of D built right in so I no longer need the additional D vitamin I had been taking to get 2000 IU for my immune system (I work at a desk not to mention I live in Michigan...). It also contains MORE B6 and B12 (a LOT more) than the B vitamin I had been taking. Wow!This leads me to my last nice surprise"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,We were introduced to the Passion Tea at Starbucks and love it. I love making it into iced Passion Tea and iced Passion Tea Lemonaide. It is so refreshing. Just add lemon juice and sweetener after the tea is made.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"At first, I loved this machine. I slept great listening to the waves. However, right before I would receive a text or call on my cell phone, the sleep machine would make a weird noise. After a few months, the machine suddenly quit working for no reason at all. It was never dropped or damaged. I unscrewed the back of it. There aren't any loose wires; it just will not work."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"This mask feels GREAT on my face, and I use it often at home when I'm having trouble sleeping. However, I really wish they'd redesign the strap. It's two velcro bands that connect in the middle, which makes it more akward to sleep my back due to the thickness of the two straps + velcro combined in the back. It also makes it more diffult to make minor tension adjustments, and loud when I open up the strap to make adjustments (which annoys my wife). It would be better with a simple flat tensioning device in the back, or one on either side near the temple."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Great cooling pack. The 7.5"" x 11"" is a perfect size for my knee. It is very easy to form into perfect shape. This pack does NOT get too cold but it is perfect temperature when putting directly on the skin. I keep it in a ziploc bag when putting it into the freezer to prevent damage from it (thanks to recommendations from Amazon reviewers). I always cool my knee after working out and that prevents inflamation from happening and keeps my arthritis under control. Great cooling pack. I bought one for my mother as well for her knee."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These were recommended to me by the gentleman at our local health foods store. I've been taking them for the past 1.5 years, as my daughter is now 6 months old. Neither during nor after pregnancy have I experienced any sickness in relation to them and have found them to be easy to take.To the reviewer who commented about having to take 5 per day - one-a-day vitamins are not all that helpful because your body can only take in what it is currently lacking. Thus, most of your vitamin will be wasted. Furthermore, these vitamins are generally synthetic, so they can squeeze more ""stuff"" into the vitamin, but your body doesn't absorb synthetics as well as natural vitamins. The reason you have to take 5 of these is because these are not synthetic - they are in fact natural (plant-derived) vitamins. If it's helpful, I take 3 with breakfast and 2 with dinner. This way, my body is able to take what it needs throughout the day."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Took two a day for a few weeks...no noticeable positive effect. I am rating it a two stars though just because upon a cold turkey discontinuing of use, I have had some breakouts, acne. So clearly it does something...just not what I hoped.I have learned lately that I have Hashimoto's. There has been so much written about the need for ioding for thyroid function, BUT, If you have Hashimoto's watch out for ANY form of iodine. Iodine will trigger the immune system into destroying the thyroid."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"We have been going to a local restaurant that serve this on Thursday. Everyone we tried just didn't taste right or had very little broccoli. I picked this up one day at our local store. Was a little suspect on just adding boiling water to this. What a big surprise. Very good soup! I added some frozen chopped broccoli, simmer. Let me tell you we do not make the special trip anymore for Cheddar Broccoli soup. You'll be surprise how well it taste."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I am an endurance athlete who does long distance events. Powerbars are a staple of my pre and post-workout fueling regime. They are calorie dense (250 per bar) and combine protein and carbs (40 g. carbs, 8g protein) which the current research says is most optimal for performance. You are feel ""full"" during your training without discomfort or cramps. Plus, I just like the way they taste, but they all taste similar. Avoid the berry varieties and fruit flavors:) The downside of the bars is that they are not for ""on the run""--they are rather chewy and need to be well digested. They also get hard in the cold, so do not bring with you on runs in the winter:)Dieters, beware"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"Unfortunately I couldn't live without these. Well I could use a catheter, but that is not a good option. By using this product I can mantain an active life without everyone knowing I have bladder problems."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,Ordered these Elmo straw cups for my daughters 2nd bday party on 2/13/11 but recieved the sippy cups tops instead of the straws... I am so disappointed though my daughter is excited that Elmo is on the cup! Review is not for Take & Toss (as we love their cups) but the seller because they don't seem to pay attention to what is being ordered!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"As earlier posted, Lavazza products are some of the foremost Italian coffees. It's delicious to those of us who appreciate quality coffee."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Would recommend this to anyone interested in a low carb cycle yet meet their protein requirements. Could taste better. Been using this for a year now.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I use these 2 times a day to be small snacks to keep up a 5 time a day small meal habit. These taste great and are easy to store and keep my metabolism up. I also use the originals sometimes as After work out drinks. The high Protein count makes them really good for Men. someone mentioned that you should use the originals instead for more of the protein but i just see it as a way of eating more of the foods i love to get the real protein like steaks, turkey etc."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My homeopath recommended I use Nattokinase along with a 1/2 dose of my Plavix after I experienced two heart attacks. I don't have any scientific evidence (lab results)yet of it's effectivess, but when I do, I'll publish my results. However, I have had no more heart symptoms since starting this product. Would love to hear from others with more experience with this product too!"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,I had never used Watkins ointment but had a friend who has raved about it for years. For dry and chapped lips I normally use Neosporin lip treatment or Carmex but lately neither item worked. Just recently my lips became so chapped and dry that they actually hurt and I had some serious dryness around my mouth. My friend suggested I get some Watkins. I went online to order it from Amazon but knew that would take at least 2 days since I was out of town. I found out this was sold at Cracker Barrel restaurants. I bought it and applied it before I went to bed and by morning I could tell the difference. My lips cleared up within 2 days. I also applied this ointment to a cut and it definitely soothes the soreness. I have 2 large tins for my home and office and a small tin for my purse. I am definitely a believer in this product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,This is some great tasting protein that mixes very well. I use it with water or milk and it always tastes good. Has BCAA (Branch Chain Amino Acids) added in unlike some other proteins. Very happy overall and am on my 5th bottle. I find Double Chocolate too be the best flavor. Hated the Vanilla Ice Cream. Plain vanilla and strawberry flavors were pretty decent too.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,good taste... good quality... fresh... great price... easy to get out of the packet... i am very happy with the purchase of this product over and over again. it tastes great in my iced tea and in many other uses. good quality product. i use alot of it.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I ordered these as a last attempt to be able to continue nursing my third son, who is 6 months old. I have two other boys and just suffered through the pain! I wish i would have known about these 5 years ago! Good protection, good fit, stay in place well, and baby didn't seem to be affected by them at all! Great buy!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,I love these. I was recently diagnosed with plantar faciitis and had to get orthotics from the foot doctor at a cost of over $40. These are made by the same company and cheap enough that I ordered a couple pair so I can put them in my slippers and sneakers and not have to bother with changing one pair back and forth. My feet feel great and I will probably be able to forgo surgery now.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I had been taking Trigosamine , purchased from a different source, for several months before I ordered from you. I was very happy with it after about six weeks and continue to be. I ordered from you because of your reputation and lower cost."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,I think the popcorn tastes great. I reminds me when we didn't have microwaves and had to pop it on the stove. A definite plus is that it has fewer hulls than other brands.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have used Wellness Formula for years, I love this stuff. Keeps me from getting sick. I only take one when I start to feel under the weather or I am around someone who is sick."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I can get this product in bulk from Wegman's for just a dollar more per lbs, but since this vendor has less expensive bulk Gluten and other vegan type products, it worth buying from here."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This is a renewal order. We purchased these tablets last year and they're effective in helping joint soreness, and are reasonably priced. This company's service is fast and priced right. We will order from them again."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,1.0,I have been using this for about 120 days now and I have not seen any apparent effects. Maybe I don't understand.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I bought this to help the healing process of a rotator cuff tear. Since I don't sit down much, I wear it when I go to bed.. it's nice that it is timed to turn off after 20 minutes. The pad is comfortable, the heat just right. Now my wife and I fight over it... so I'll have to get another one."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I had a minor knee injury, decided to try this gel. Yes, it absorbs well and it is not greasy, but it just does not do anything. Moreover I was taking arnica pills (little white balls) at the same time to have more effect and looks like it also did not do anything.Kind of disappointed.... wasted time and money"
health personal care,health care,allergy,4.0,"works great, keeps my sinus problems at bay....definitely keeps me from getting sinus infections when seasonal allergies hit. Although, it seems they changed the amount of pepper in this formula and it's higher in menthol.Great Product, I highly recommend this to anyone with sinus / allergy problems."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"We have used these for years. Now, our grown children are addicted. They work flawlessly and forever. The Amazon seller shipped right away. We have dual speed and single speed, and the single speed works very well since the sound ""volume"" is adjustable on both models. Save the $10 extra for dual speed."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,Couldn't write an honest review. Took them a month to send me the wrong stuff. Would recommend finding a better seller.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,oils,1.0,"Hidden Valley needs to remove this from their products. MSG is the 2nd ingredient in this, which means it contains a lot. MSG is poison and causes cancer. I will never buy another one of their products as long as they keep using this."

Now my wife and I fight over it... so I'll have to get another one."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,1.0,"Two of the four pill counting trays arrived cracked and unusable. Upon contacting the seller, I received the run-around and an extremely poor response. While the seller did end up replacing the two damaged trays, it took weeks and it took NUMEROUS phone calls and emails to get this taken care of. I am beyond disappointed in the poor customer service. The product is not well made either and prob ably won't last as it is made of a type of plastic that cracks easily. In addition, the seller refuses to add packing material so I'm sure many products get damaged during shipping. Some simple packing peanuts or whatever would have prevented the problem in the first place. I would never purchase this item again and I would NEVER purchase from this seller again!!!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,1.0,"I eat one of these a day and I love them. I decided to order off of Amazon because of free shipping. The entire box is totally stale!!!! I know what fresh ones taste like and these are discolored and gross. I can't eat them, what a waste of money. Boo."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is the product we use when my elderly mom complains of constipation. It works all the time. We used to use slippery elm but it did not give consistent results. We also used some ""natural"" product that the doctor recommended but it didn't work well either. It is good to start off w/ one capsule gradually because using 3 at once can cause an unexpected accident especially for an elderly person."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,Shipper sent this to me promptly. It was well packaged and very fresh. This is great tasting tea with a nice minty flavor. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"By heightening the arch and giving additional padding to the heel, it has taken alot of pressure off the spur and I am returning to my exercise programs."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"I'm sad to say that this is not wort the $20 I paid. I expected a booster much more sturdy, and usable. This high chair tray is so difficult to put on, it takes both hands and a push with your hips to get it on there. The plastic is flimsy, but I guess thats what you get in a folding chair, right? So I won't let that factor influence my opinion. Good thing the safari animals are cute, or else I'd go back to my huge,ugly, yet practical Graco high chair. Maybe worth $10 new, otherwise I wouldn't buy it used."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,2.0,"Decent quality roasted seaweed snack compare to what you can get from Asian Markets and Trader Joe's. I didn't realize that they're 0.2oz size bags when I ordered. Even with the 15% subscription discount, which bring it down to $0.67 per bag, it's still cost 50%+ more then Trader Joe's (they sell a 0.4oz bag for $0.99). With that said, it actually cost $4.19 more to buy at quantity. My conclusion"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,We were looking for the old-fashioned heating pad without the annoying automatic shutoff feature. This is it! Works great and comes from the reliable Sunbeam manufacturer.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"The collar delivers, but it is too big for people with small necks like me. If your neck is 15"" or smaller, don't buy."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"In movie theaters in Hawaii, they don't only offer regular popcorn at the concession stand, but you will also find Hurricane Popcorn as an option.Hurricane Popcorn is essentially made up of popcorn, rice crackers, furikake/nori mix and of course lot's of butter! Born in Hawaii, I have grown up on Hurricane Popcorn and to the unique tastes of food and snacks.What you get in each individual Hurricane Popcorn package"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have been using this tea for a few years now, and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed. It begins to take effect the next morning. I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well, she now orders it online."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"As another reviewer indicated, this is a great product - probably equivalent or nearly so to the gold standard - Life Extension's product. However, I find this curcumin to be more tolerable to my stomach than the Life Extensions product. Definitely take the capsule on a full stomach. Besides the multitude of benefits from curcumin, I use it as part of a hair loss program."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,4.0,"A friend, who grew up in El Salvador, made some hot chocolate one night. We all wanted know what ingredients he'd used - we loved the drink! This was not the Quik of childhood.I pop a piece into a large mug of skim milk - into the microwave for a bit/'til heated through. Mix w/ a small egg whisk and enjoy."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,1.0,You never get the same reading twice it keeps on going up and up and eventually it will show that your kid/ baby has fever which I already know by kissing the forehead and seeing the crankiness. But in the first 2-3 measurements show that he doesn't have fever. So you can not rely on this. If he is doesn't have a fever it will go up and eventually it will go down but it varies by 2-3 degrees each time you take a measurement. Absolute piece of junk!
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I was so upset and disappointed to find out that Breathe Right had discontinued their Snore Relief spray. It's the ONLY thing that stops my husband's snoring. It saved my marriage (and sanity) and I don't know how I'm going to ever get any sleep again without it. When I could no longer find it at the store, I was thrilled to find it available through a clearing warehouse via Amazon, so we bought a year's worth. But when it runs out, I don't know what I'm going to do. The only similar spray available is a homeopathic one that (A) doesn't work and (B) my husband says tastes awful. I just want Breathe Right to start making it again!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"My husband had a heart attack several years ago in his forties. He has been off and on statin drugs - they are effective at keeping his cholestrol levels in an acceptable place, but the side effects are a problem. I read about this Sytrinol product, it sounded good, so we've given it a try. Prior to Sytrinol with just fish oil his cholestrol levels were as follows"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"These are cheap, low calorie (though high sodium) snacks you can brew in your coffee mug. I keep a supply for each flavor under my desk for when I need a little something in the middle of the day. I wouldn't call them ""soup"" but they are hot and tasty! Also just great if you're sick (and then the salt helps a sore throat). I'm addicted to them now!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was very nervous about taking any supplement for something like this, as I have never done so before. So after researching ingredients of MANY supplements, I chose Breast Actives. I was sceptical, but so tired of being ""shown up"" by 13 year olds at the beach! Then my breasts shrank after loosing weight to exercise, making me more unhappy with their size. Even though my husband assured me he loves my breasts the way they are, I really wanted to do this for myself. So I went for it. SO glad I did! After 2 weeks I notice they were firmer. Now after 3 weeks, my bra is getting tight. Yesterday I bought my first non-padded, non-pushup bra and I actually look okay in it! My husband is over-seas and he even noticed on Skype (video chat online) that they were bigger when one day I wore a low-cut shirt to talk to him! I just ordered my second set of cream and supplement. I am actually looking forward to swimsuit season this year! I can't wait for my husband to get home! I'm sure he won't be disappointed that I took a supplement! ;-)"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I ordered this for my husband. He remembers using this when he played sports in High School. He rubs it on after a hot shower for muscle pain relief. It works great!
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,2.0,"When I received this item it was labeled ""Sea Salt."" In fact, the Sea Salt version of these chips is also described as ""lightly salted,"" so you might think the two were one and the same. However, these are listed as having 115g of sodium per serving, while the Sea Salt version has 135g of sodium per serving. If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I have been wearing these for years, and could not believe the price when I saw it. You will not find a better deal on these full size orthotics anywhere. FYI - these cured my plantar fasciaitis, er whatever!"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"I originally bought these pads in Sept of '09 from a company called Northshore. The quality WAS excellent.When I re-ordered them in Feb 2011, I used the same link from my account, assuming that I would be ordering the same product. But I received a cheap, thin, non-absorbant Chinese-made imitation from some other company. VERY DISAPPOINTING.Only buy from NorthShore is you want the real pads."
baby products,feeding,unknown,5.0,"I carry very low, so I thought it would help to get any extra support. I do feel a difference when I am on my feet for an extended period of time and am very glad I bought this product.I do think it runs a bit smaller than I had expected, but still fit in to the recommended size."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,i love muscle milk i give it 5 stars but it took forever to arrive which is not what i want with a grocery product.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I am not a breakfast eater, and not a particular fan of oatmeal. I decided to give this a try as it had a greater amount of protein than most cereals of this nature. It is very lightly sweet (not like Quaker's etc), and a teeney bit chewy texture, which I find I like. I sometimes cube a little apple and throw into the microwave first for 30 seconds, then add the cereal to it to cook. I really, really like this cereal so much so that I have it on 'Subscribe & Save', as it is the best value. Besides which, I don't have to go chasing it down in the grocery stores. Sometimes there, sometimes not. Prices are also much higher in the store, unless it is on sale."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I will never go back to a regular pie crust! This is better than most ""normal"" crusts.I've been making pie crusts since I was a kid. Lard is the best, but can't use that anymore.When we went GF, all hopes of good pie crust were dashed. Found some premade ones that tasted (and looked) like they were made out of sawdust and wood glue. They shattered just be looking at them, before baking. After baking, they tasted like dirty feet. Ewwww. I threw them away. At $5.00 each, that was tough.Then I saw this box at the store. Bought it with little hope. OMG IT IS SO GOOD!!!Very flaky, very tasty. I am still working on the best way to roll it out. I've only used it for deep dish meals, such as chicken pot pie, Greek pie, and fruit cobblers. I mash it in the bown or baking dish I'm cooking the food in and it works wonderfully.I also used it to make a modified Baklava. Rolled it thin, put it in the freezer for a couple of minutes, laid it in a Pyrex dish, brushed the top with butter, added some finely chopped roasted almonds, more thin pie crust, butter almonds, cinnamon.Cut in triangles before baking. After baking I poured honey over them. It was awesome. Folks I made it for thought it was better than Filo dough."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have used this product for years and was happy to find it on Amazon. Solgar makes the purest vitamins.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I've started weight training lately and noticed I've been lacking in protein intake. I don't really like milk and I didn't want to quit eating my oats for breakfast so I decided to throw it in my oatmeal (and I also add crushed Shredded Wheat to help thicken up the texture and for extra fiber)! I eat my oatmeal with water and I've gotta say it taste awesome :) It also tastes like hot cocoa if you shake it up with hot water. Highly recommend this product--it taste awesome and is worth every cent :)
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"If you're used to fruit loops or even cheerios in the morning, you're not going to be a fan of the cereal. It is naturally sweetened with raisins and dates. Ive incorporated it into my household and sent a few box to my parents. They're hooked on it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I was looking through my previous orders and came across this mess! I should have reviewed this already! This is a complete waste of time and MONEY! I dont understand why these people have positive misleading reviews about this stupid product! It is a scam! It does NOTHING!!! NOTHING AT ALL! You people who have GREAT things to say about this product are not being honest because if you did have any kind of growth, then it is not or will not be permanent! Just stop already and take this off of amazon! I dont understand people these days! Dont matter if you buy here or off the actual website, it is a phony product and EVERYONE needs to know that! Don't waste your money on this. Honestly, I took this for a LONG TIME and it did nothing for me. I am a healthy eater and everything you can imagine and this product still did nothing for me!

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"This was the first month I used these. I thought they wouldn't work because they were cheap and were kind of no-frills. I started testing a bit early, maybe around the 10th day and consistently found the line lighter than the other reference line. As the 14th/15th day passed, I still kept seeing those frustrating 2 lines clearly different in color.I thought it may be too subtle for me to notice the difference, and thought I may have missed this cycle.But I didn't realize I had later ovulation than usual, and sure enough around the 17th/18th day, there was no mistaking that the line was finally much darker than the reference line. There was no other interpretation.. So it works great IMO.It did work for us btw, after two attempts, we conceived fine and are now close to delivery"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"My boyfriend has/had this set (he broke his saucer as a child) and we got it as a christening gift for my nephew. I had to double check the Wedgwood sit because I thought there had been a mistake--the plate looks VERY different from the teacup and bowl and the cup does not have ""Now run along and don't get into mischief"" behind the handle OR the picture of Peter inside (the old cup has him running along on the inside). The older set (my boyfriend's) also has much darker colors even though it is more than 20 years old. I'm still going to gift it but might have preferred to get a two-piece set instead because the teacup and bowl match well and the plate looks so strange in comparison--almost like a machine painted it and was out of an essential color. Also, the packaging is kind of ratty looking so I'll be wrapping each piece in tissue. Still cute though. And, seriously, your average little boy will not know the difference."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I was glad to find an online source for this uniquely assertive honey when I moved as it was carried by an upscale local chain in Chicago. I have been using Airborne Thyme honey in cooking for over ten years now. I have found it adds a lovely sweet note to help balance out many savory dishes when used with the proper light touch. How light? I could taste its unique herbal notes when I used only one tablespoon to bring balance to the classic recipe for Buffalo wings of just hot sauce and butter. I love this honey in homemade barbecue, too, both in the finishing sauce and as part of a wet rub to create a nice bark on pork."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I'm a terrible chocolate craving fiend, and this stuff really helps me out. But this is like a lot of Walden Farms products. You are going to see reviews that say OH GOD IT'S SO TERRIBLE BOO HOO. But you inevitably find that these people stuck the stuff straight from a spoon into their face.Listen.IT IS A DIP. IT IS A DIP, A DIP A DIP A DIP. It is not designed to be eaten alone. It is made with cellulose gel, cocoa, and artificial sweetener... of course it has a ""weird"" taste if you just shove it plain into your mouth. It's just like if you shoved your mouth full of splenda!! (That is essentially what you're doing after all.) It's amazing on strawberries, apples, anything with a bit of tartness to it. It is not, however, good on bananas because yeah... it does have a slight acidity, and when you put it on a banana it's just like... what the hell. But seriously. Any kind of berries, just do it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I've been using this product faithfully for almost a month, (I have about 3 days of pills left), and though I haven't noticed a change in size yet, I've definitely noticed a change in shape and firmness. Breastfeeding my son left me as a 30A that was less than ""perky""! However, I can definitely tell they're firming up! (Plus my stretch marks from pregnancy have faded A LOT! That in itself is a miracle! I have ordered another months supply and plan on finishing that out to see what happens. Will update with results later.As for the product, a lot of people complain about the pills smelling horrible, but really they just smell and taste like fennel, which has a slight licorice taste to it. I was raised on fennel tea for my stomach so I actually LOVE it, but I can see how it might put other people off. The cream doesn't really have a scent, and though it's thick in texture I don't really think it's greasy like some lotions.Other side effects...I've noticed my breasts tend to become achy shortly after taking the pill or using the cream. It lasts about 30-60 minutes at times, but is never really a problem, more like a minor annoyance. The first week it made them tender to the touch, but that went away.I am giving this 3 stars simply because it's up in the air right now until I've had more time to make a better decision. All I suggest is that each person come to their own conclusion and not let other people's lack of success sway your decision. As you can tell by reading other reviews, it works for some, but not for ALL. You'll never know if you're one of the lucky ones until you try. If you take it one month at a time it's really not expensive at all, and that way if you aren't satisfied, you don't have multiple bottles of pills left over.Good luck!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This may be a great product but it tastes awful. I was looking for a pill-free calcium supplement. Yes, it takes like pina colada, but it also tastes like chalk. When I first tasted it, I thought it wasn't bad. The first week I took it just fine and wasn't bothered by it. By the second week I was wincing at the thought of taking it every night. By the third week I avoided it several nights in a row and when I did take it had to choke it down. Last night I took it and felt nauseous, not because I think there's anything wrong with the product but my taste buds have had enough of that chalky taste. Today I'm throwing the rest out and ordered some calcium chocolate chews to try instead. It's too bad, if they could get rid of the chalky taste I'm sure I could continue taking it. Also I find that liquid supplements tend to cause a sticky mess in the fridge, unless you wipe off the bottle every time."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My experience with all Drs Best products I have tried is that they are always one of the best quality supplements you can buy at a very reasonable price. In the past I have used their resveratrol, krill oil, 5 HTP, and now the Glucosamine, (GC). If you're someone that takes or has tried a variety of supplements in the past, then you well know that the quality, especially in the actual dosage delivered can vary greatly. The one thing I have always been able to count on with Drs Best is a good solid concentrated dosage of whatever the supplement may be. Whatever the label advertises is exactly what you get. No promising a high milligram count only to read the label to find out it is either no where near that, or isn't broken down and explained to you at all. This GC is no different. It delivers exactly what it promises. 750 mg of Glucosamine, 600 of Chondrioton, and 500 mg of MSN. You can't do any better than these three ingredients together for joint pain and bone health. Personally they have worked wonders for me with the arthritis in my knees. I went from having to use an arthritis rub and heating pad every night to no pain at all, and a lot more flexibility in both knees. I will never be without it again...One thing that should be noted about this particular Drs Best brand. This bottle contains all three ingredients in a standard regular dose, not a double or triple strength dosage that is available in lots of other brands. Some people that have advance or very painful arthritis may need the extra strength variety. In my opinion its best to try the lower dosage first only because you may be just spending extra money for the potent dose without needing it. The price and quantity of this Drs best GC is an excellent value, and as quality a supplement of all three ingredients you can buy. Highly recommended, as is all the Drs Best supplements I have used are..."

health personal care,health care,unknown,2.0,"Swimming:I took up swimming in the pool as exercise for my back and someone suggested these silicone ear plugs to prevent water going into your ears in the swimming pool.These ear plugs do not prevent water going into your ear.The ear plugs that work well for swimming are these Aqua Sphere conical swimmers ear plugsNoise:My significant other snores, so I've become an expert on ear plugs.I have tried quite a few of them and Mack's earokugs is among them. Below is a summary of my experiences with different ear plugs. I hope you will find it useful. Other the noise protection, the important factors for me if the plugs stay in your ear, and if they are breathable (some of them made my ear canals hot and sweaty, that makes them itch, and itching wakes me up).* Mack's pillow soft earplugs (sillicone), 22 decibels. These earplugs did not work for me at all. They did not provide enough sound protection, my ear canal got hot and sweaty and itchy (and needing to itch wakes me up), and they also tend to fall out.* Hearos ear plugs,ultimate softness, 32 decibels. Hearos have a good size, not too long not too short. They are slightly shorter than Flent Quiet time, so they don't stick out of my ear, and this means they don't catch the pillow and don't get pulled out. They are also slightly softer, and provide a little less protection. Overall they are comfortable, but I find that my ears get hot and sweather using them.* Hearos ear plugs, Xtreme protection Series, 33 decibels. Hearos are slightly shorter than Flent Quiet time, so they don't stick out of my ear, and thus stay in better. They are firmer than Hearos ultimate softness so they provide more noise protection. Overall they are comfortable, but I find that my ears get hot and sweather using them.* Flents Quiet Contour, molded foam, 33 decibels.This is my favorite ear plug. It gives me the best noise protection, it stays in the ear very well, it is comfortable, my ear canal does not get hot and itchy. I find the most comfortable.* Flent Quiet Time, comfort foam, 33 decibels. I like these earplugs less thant Quiet Contour because it does not seem to stay in my ear as well. The ends of the foam seem to stick out and catch on the pillow when I turn, catching the end on the pillow pulls them out of my year. I got it to stay in the ear better by trimming about 3/8th of an inch. Because they tend to fall out, I don't get as good of a sleep in them. However, when they are in the sound protection is good. (see attached photo of the full size ear plug, and the one that is trimmed to be shorter)For me Flents Contour ear plugs win on all counts - noise protection, comfort, staying, breathability."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"I am absolutely amazed and thrilled to have located these snacks!!! I've been on the Medifast diet plan for 3+ months now and the plan entails keeping carbs low and protein a bit higher. Unfortunately, Medifast food is very expensive.I happened across a mention of these in one of the medifast discussion threads and decided to give them a try. I WILL NEVER buy medifast parmesan cheese puffs for more than $2 per serving again!! These are so much better - and while they have slightly less fiber - they have fewer carbs as well - and nearly equivalent protein. Less sodium too.Best of all - they have a light, non greasy texture, suberb crunch and a good cheese flavor.Just ordered 2 more boxes so my kids can have some as well!Woohoo!!! Yay Kay's!!!

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I lost a filling just before the weekend and knew I would have to wait till the following Monday to call the dentist. Saturday morning I woke up in a lot of pain. I was taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 1500 mg of Tylenol every 8 hours and 4 hours, respectively. At first it kept things under control... until I tried to eat and drink. It didn't matter how careful I was, once the pain started there was no going back. My whole jaw on that side, my cheekbone, my ear...it was too much. I called the number for the 24 hr nurse on my health card for any advice. The upshot was that I should try the dentemp (and get a script from my primary in case of infection). My husband picked up the dentemp and I went on-line to read the reviews. I was quite disheartened and if I had seen these beforehand I probably wouldn't have used it.When I got the dentemp I made a small ball of it between my fingers (think silly putty) and stuck it in the hole, pressed and then bit down. Within two minutes the pain was GONE! I could feel where it had hurt and was grateful. In a little while I couldn't even feel that little remnant of pain. Thre was no numbness in any of the surrounding areas, the pain simply did not exist!I was able to eat and drink all the things I normally eat and drink over the rest of the weekend, albeit, carefully. When I finally got to the dentist on Monday, I was still very comfortable (as though I had no issues at all!) When she saw the hole in my tooth, she exclaimed on the level of pain this must have produced. I don't think I would have managed with my sanity intact if it weren't for dentemp."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"After a year of mostly on, but sometimes off, trying to conceive, I was frustrated with all the methods I had already tried. I read portions of Natural Family Planning books, did the Basal Thermometer, Ovulation Predictor Kits, etc. And there always seemed to be a reason why these methods failed to work for me. I'm not a morning person so remembering to take my temperature every morning when I'm still half asleep and tending to snooze (the alarm) ten times before getting out of bed was not working. The NFP methods did not give me clear results. I tried charting but I wanted something more concrete. I wanted to really KNOW whether or not I was ovulating.One would therefore believe that the OPKs would do the trick. But they were just not for me. I tried the sticks with the two lines. I swear I never got my second line darker than the first, but it often looked to be the same color. Maybe I just don't have the sensitivity of perception on this one, but reading the lines was exasperating and still not giving me the concrete answer I was looking for...yes...no?Next, I went strictly digital, but the digital kits are much more expensive and often sold in smaller bundles. I have a varied cycle, 26 - 34 days on average. The first time I did the weekly kit I got a smiley face - a positive sign. I wasn't able to conceive and so we tested with the digital OPK the next month and I did not get an ovulation indicator this time around. Did this mean I didn't ovulate this month, or that I planned the timing poorly based on my varied cycle?Taking two digital kits in one month seemed cost prohibitive, so I really wanted something that would essentially do the same thing - be a digital yes/no result over the entire month. For that reason, the ClearBlue Easy Fertility Monitor was the natural choice for me, and as mentioned, something I wish I would have done to begin with. It would have actually saved me a bunch of money I spent on all the other stuff I tried...Being a nerd, I read the instruction book twice the day it arrived (which happened to be day 4 of my cycle) so I was able to start the kit the next morning (being that it gives you the first 5 days to set the monitor). By then I was very familiar with the ins and outs of the monitor and told my husband that I was optimistic we'd conceive within 3 months.Month 1, as the instruction book explains, may lead to a lot of high fertility days and possibly no peak day as the monitor gets to know you. I was a little discouraged with this result for myself...as I found myself in the high range for 10 days or so, while never reaching peak fertility. I was also on business travel half of this time, so our efforts were a bit interrupted. Needless to say I didn't conceive. But I was optimistic about the next two months.Month 2, was completely the opposite. I received NO high fertility days and jumped straight to peak on Day 17 of my cycle. Elated to see an ovulation sign, we attempted conception once again that day and the next, and crossed our fingers for good results. And that was it...On Day 35 of my cycle when my period had not arrived, I took a pregnancy test, and it went immediately to pregnant!We are so excited and currently 18 weeks along in this pregnancy. Prior to this result, I was really getting a little paranoid that maybe I didn't ovulate often, or regularly, and my doctor was talking to me about clomid and other fertility options. I'm just elated I held out, found this tool, and something that could give me the decisive answer I needed in my varying cycles.I recommend this product for women like me, who've had limited success with other methods, and have very irregular cycles. I also recommend reading the directions ahead of time. I felt the product was easy to use, but I read a TON of reviews, and while most were positive, many of the negative comments seemed to stem partly from ignorance on the product. For example, some reviewers complained about the ""lines"" on the stick not reading the same as the digital message, but the instructions clearly state these sticks are not meant to be read as typical OPKs. Obviously nothing can guarantee a pregnancy - but for me - this was the easiest/best way for me to interpret my monthly cycle.I would recommend this product to my friends, and plan to use it again for future pregnancies. I could not be more pleased with the results!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,unknown,5.0,"Being a fan of loose leaf teas, particularly green, these t-sac filters are my preferred choice. I like the fact that I'm not dealing with metal as is the case with most diffusers. Also, there's really no clean up as you simply throw the filter out when you're done using. These are also great if you are sharing your teas or having people try your teas out. Simply put the tea in the filter and voila. The argument can be made that a diffuser is more cost efficient as you don't need to buy more diffusers as is the case with these filters. However, again, there's no cleaning, I'm not tied to a particular cup/diffuser, and I can share. If the concern is that the filter does not allow the leaf to fully expand, simply buy a larger filter size 2,3,etc. The flavor of the teas really come through."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,The hole at the top of the bag for the connector causes quite a bit of difficulty when you are trying to pour milk into or out of the bags. I've accidently spilled milk a few times which is very frustrating considering it is like liquid gold. Perhaps if Medela made this new style like the old where you could rip off the top and thus remove the portion where the holes are after you've pumped that would solve the problem? Overall I am hoping I can find a few boxes of the old style with the tape available somewhere.

After more than a month of use its odor has lessened, but nothing else has improved. Instead of a rectangular shape as I expected, it has a hump in the middle of it, presumedly for greater coverage of your back, but in truth it just adds to the weight of the thing. Moreover, it has individual packets of the filling held on with velcro, which creates cool areas in the whole. In mine, one of the packets, which has two divisions, has filling in only one of them, further adding to the imbalance of the whole and showing a certain lack of quality control by the maker.Furthermore,the packets are made of very light weight cotton, and are sure to wear through rather quickly. The cover is plush and rich looking, but the velcro closing used to hold the wrap in place is more annoying than helpful. The sticky velcro side catches on everything and picks up fleece and threads from my robes and gowns; every time I move it, I have to unsnare that side.Moist Heat Therapy Warming Neck Wrap - 174-101-10The glue used to adhere the velcro yellowed after the first two heatings, making it un-returnable according to the manufacturer's instructions. I don't use it as I intended, around my neck, but it does work for my back at night, so it's not completely a bust. Buyer beware."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,I am a chief of an emergency squad and had been looking to do a ems jump bag for a member.

health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"As adults giving a skinny 4 year old insulin injections 4 - 8 times a day, we LOVE this product. There is no way for BD to get the needles short enough to get the insulin out of the vial (I called and asked) AND into the almost non-existant fat deposits on our son. The inject-ease covers the syringe to reduce visual stress, 'shortens' and stabilizes the needle so Mr. Squirmy doesn't re-poke himself and we don't get his muscle. Thank God and Ambimed, Inc.!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Texas Pete is a mild sauce that goes with a lot of foods. I love the stuff. But then I'm a Louisiana native and I have yet to meet a pepper I don't like. Texas Pete has nothing to do with Texas, as has been pointed out previously, so don't expect it to be spicy like the foods you tasted in San Antonio or along the border. It sorta fits in the same category as the various Louisiana hot sauces although it is produced in North Carolina. It's a vinegar-based sauce, not very hot but lightly spiced with tasty peppers.I admit to liking lots of different hot sauces. I keep a wide variety in the fridge and use them often. Texas Pete is one of the milder sauces that goes well when you want just a little spice for taste but don't want too much heat. Unless you're a masochist who has to have blisters on your tongue, you may enjoy it's lighter taste."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"In response to other reviews I added a couple of tablespoons of agave nectar to the mix to give the yeast some extra sugar to use. The bread turned out wonderful and I like it. Maybe not exactly the same as wheat bread but much better than most I have tried.For someone who still has yeast not getting the bread to rise, it may be your water. Try a batch with bottled water & see if this makes a difference."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"There were perks being born in the late eighties and growing up in the '90s. You missed the '70s completely, you weren't born in the '90s, Doug and Rugrats were on Nickelodeon, and your mom bought you a box of Dunkaroos every time you went to the grocery store with her. You behaved all through out the store. How else were you going to get them? That sly gal was trying to bribe you into not behaving like a demented devil child, but hell was it working. Usually kids got a cookie for behaving well in a grocery store, but you don't get a thing of frosting to dunk your cookie in. A mere grocery store cookie was small potatoes. You knew what was good. And when the trip was finally over, you got yourself some Dunkaroos. But then...Although I haven't been able to find Dunkroos in store for at least a decade, Amazon (of course) saves the day again. Thank you Amazon for feeding my nostalgic soul the roos it needed to feel like a kid again."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty. I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate. I tried it several times and just could not drink it. I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste. Not mine. I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow! So, for now, I will have to try something else. Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,2.0,"I bought this to use for my child. I had wanted to try the ear type thermometer for a while. The first two reading seemed to be correct but after that it was horrible. The readings were all over the place on multiple uses, and were not reliable at all. It is also hard to tell if the probe is positioned in the childs ear correctly. The batteries did not last long either. I do not like or trust this thermometer and am must happier and confident with the plain old stick thermometer. I do NOT recommend this product."

I started looking around to find a more affordable source of the tea and thought Amazon would be just the place.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I'm not a die-hard Atkins meal person, but I am one of those people who does better on lower carb meals. I am not on a diet kick or anything crazy, but I do like to have something like this around for days/nights when work is so crazy/busy I don't make it to the cafeteria or whatever. Last night for example I looked at the clock and realized my meal choices had just gotten reduced to either a vending machine or the Atkins bars that had just arrived in the mail.I like the Atkins in general because I don't like the carbs in the more usual offerings. I mean 30 grams of sugars???? Aack. I'd rather go with the higher protein/fiber and much lower carb offerings. In fact the one I had last night (chocolate chip cookie) filled me up and I kept on plugging without any uncontrollable urge to eat some of the home-made German chocolate cake someone had put out. Or chips. Or popcorn. You get the idea.Just be warned--try a single bar or two before you buy heavily...the sugar alcohols they use can cause some 'gastrointestinal distress' of varying orders of magnitude.Also, try the flavors...my four star here is for the chocolate decadence...frankly I didn't like that one and by itself it would have been a 2.5. However, the aforementioned cookie one actually was pretty tasty! So, overall 4 stars...and I'm not sure 5 stars is achievable in this sort of product.Overall recommended, but with the caveat of try flavors individually first, and assess your own 'response'. I'm very happy to have these as a snack or emergency meal replacement option when I'm just too busy otherwise!JTG"

I actually use at least 3 at time now. I have Osteoporosis, Ostio-arthritis and had back surgery. I have recommended these to my children, friends and everyone that the subject comes up with. After having therapy about 15 or so years ago, the therapist recommended I get these. He told me where to buy them. Then I could no longer find them anywhere. I panicked. Then I started checking on the computer. I now buy four at a time. I make a cover out small hand towels and they work just great and cozy. I highly recommend the Duro-Med pack for the relief of muscle and bone treatment. My 13 yr old dog has arthritis and she loves to lay of it. I'm glad I can get them through Amazon, it is so easy."

I have noticed that a slightly longer steeping time is probably a good idea; we'll usually give it about 6-8 minutes before we serve it.If you enjoy a tea break this tea is an excellent choice!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,We have used Colavita olive oil now for many years and have always found it to be an excellent oil for use in cooking and on salads. It has an nice flavor and is far superior to other oils we have tried in the past. I am looking at a partially used bottle as I write this review; I will also add we have a new unopened bottle in the pantry in reserve.Colavita Olive Oil is made in Italy by the Colavita family who has shipped this product to the USA for nearly 30 years according to the label. The label provides additional important information about this olive oil in that it is extra virgin and first cold pressed.I have read in a number of publications that these qualities are important when one is selecting an olive oil. My wife is our nutritional expert and always specifies this brand of olive oil only.As a husband and consumer of salads and various other assorted foods which benefit from olive oil I can testify that it has a great flavor as far as olive oils go.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I really like this flavor of the wonderful Jell-O sugar free instant puddings, the dieters delight. It really doesn't taste muchlike chocolate, but has its own distinct flavor. If you are looking for a chocolate fix, this won't do it. But it's a nice treatserved with fresh or frozen berries. We sometimes add extra milk and make a sort of milk shake with it. It's a flavor our localstores often don't stock, so we order it by the 24-pack so it's always on hand."

All I have to say is get the Natural instead of Chocolate. You can mix that one with juices or other drinks."

I was not a happy camper. so...after some research and reading I found that one could use progesterone creme to help with all the above. Now I dont tan as well and I actually will get red some but I limit my exposure to shorter times out in the sun.( Ilike and need the vitamin D3 our bodies uses to heal and stay healthy.)I wear this twice a day for 3 weeks then a week off. (I do use high grade pure fish oil from Metagenics) and some black cohosh to help with the above.) I did try however not using the creme to see if it made a difference on my skin...WOW! was I surprised. I became a piece of sandpaper, itchy, scaly, dry, my hair was noticebly different. I felt off balance....so after a couple months off the progesterone creme I went back on it.WHAT A DIFFERENCE, ITS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY....I LOVE THIS STUFF, AND BOY DOES IT WORK FOR ME!!!!I cant rate this highly enough. Im sure everyone is different but I dont want to run out of it thats for sure!I cant take sythetic hormones, so, Natural was the only way for me....not that I want to take harch chemicals that induce cancers and effect my body.so...hope this helps someone out there...Its worth a try!Love it!"

At work everyone seemed more friendly when i wore it, especially those working near me. I found that some men react more to it than others. one of my friends, when he goes to give me a hug and he smells it he backs away saying, ""You're wearing that stuff again!"" because it affects him extremely. While with my boyfriend, there isn't much affect other than he loves the scent. If it's goal is to get guys to be more sexual, or passionate, I can't see it making a difference in him. :POverall, GREAT product. It's a small bottle but it last for a long time!

Anyways, as far as the product goes...I do not like the sucralose flavor in it at all. After I drink it it's ALL I can taster. Even after I brush my teeth, I can STILL freakin' taste it. Gross. I would totally keep buying this product if it didn't have artificial sweetener in it. Your body doesn't even break the stuff down. If you don't mind the taste of sucralose than you will probably love this product because it has a nice chocolate taste and is VERY CREAMY."

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,Sure there is no cure for the common cold but this stuff work near miracles. I had a hacking cough for 2 days prior to someone recommending Mucinex DM. This stuff works wonderful and has a permanent place in my medicine cabinet. The cough went away within one hour and lasted just over 12 hours. The price was a bit much but considering how much I was paying for items that didn't work it is well worth every penny. I have purchased well over 100 items on Amazon. This is my first and most likely last review. Great stuff.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I threw the entire bottle away. These pills are over an inch long and made of very hard plastic, they are impossible to swallow without choking and gagging. One dosage is 6 pills, are the makers of this product out of their minds? When I ordered these, there was no specific dosage information in the description of this product, that's false advertising. Had I known I'd be taking 6 at once, I never would have ordered these. There should have been a picture and size of pill listed so you could know what you were in for and not be in shock when you opened the bottle. I ordered 90 pills believing this was a 3 month supply, which obviously wasn't the case. I am very disappointed with this product and Amazon allowing it to be sold without all of the vital information listed in the posting. BUYER BEWARE"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I usually don't buy chocolate-flavored protein bars because 1) I tend to eat them for breakfast, so I prefer more fruit-type flavors, and 2) I find that the chocolate bars tend to be more artificial tasting. However, I saw one of these bars on sale, and because I absolutely love mocha, I decided to give it a try.Taste-wise, this bar is excellent. It is rich, chocolate-y, and has a very good, distinct mocha flavor too. It was pleasantly chewy without having the overly nougat-like consistency that some protein bars have. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this bar, and from a flavor perspective, I would not hesitate to buy it again.The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile. At 200 calories, it is about what you would expect from a protein bar; I was fine with that. But both the fat content (7 grams, including 3.5 grams saturated) and the sugar content (17 grams, or over 3 teaspoons) were a little on the high side to me. Some bars include fiber; this one has &lt;1 gram. It does have 15 grams of protein, which was a big plus.So, in the end, I probably will buy this bar again, but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular, healthy part of my diet."

It is easy to assemble and clean after use. Each bottle comes with a top that can be used after pumping to secure and keep the milk fresh for use. Now that I have had my son I purchased this again and still feel that it is the best pump! I have tried some others, but I have found that the extra layer in the pump helps minimize nipple tenderness when starting the pumping process for new mothers. Those that offer only the cone shape with no insert hurt and stretched farther than it should be (for me anyway :D ).I love the Avent Manual Breast Pump, and won't use anything else!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I purchased Extra Virgin Coconut Oil from information I had read online and from personal friends who told be about the benefits of using Coconut Oil. I have had positive results from using this product and would recommend it to my friends. I've used it to cook with and still want to try some other possibilities with this oil. Its got a very pleasant and appealing taste. I love it!!!
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,I really like the Homedics sound spa machine. It has several sounds and you can turn it up pretty loud. I used it to drown out noise in our baby's room. We are really happy with it!
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"Homeopathic remedy, literally does nothing. It contains zero arnica, which can be an actual medicine when present in the product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I love the flavor! I make it like a hot tea and use it every night. It is the only thing that helps me sleep!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"Ok , i'm exaggerating but the bars are too big , and very sweet , maybe next time i'm gonna pick a less sweet flavor"
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,I have sensitive skin and this works great on dry patches. This tube will last me a long time. A little goes a long way. I think it is too thick for an allover lotion. I believe this would be great on baby bottoms!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've been taking Quadra-Zyme Plus once a day for 2 years now and it's a great product. Naturally, the most convenient place to buy it is Amazon.com!I've never had digestive problems at all. My doctor told me everyone should take these enzymes because they help our bodies process the food we eat. I take it after the biggest meal of my day.Try it and enjoy a happy and healthy life!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is one of the best tasting protein bars I have found; however, it has 30 grams of sugar. If you're young and have a fast metabolism, I suppose it doesn't matter, though."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"Just like at the movie theater. A little salty if you add all of the ""butter salt"". I just wish it was more buttery tasting."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"I really like this high chair. THe only issue I have is that its a bit bulky and when it's folded, you cannot open it one handed (if you have baby in your arms, you have to set him or her down to open). Other than that I reccomend it!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"After noticing that all my local stores no longer are putting Folgers Latte on their shelves, which I can't understand why, it was the best, and my local wallmart was always running out. I was very frustrated. It was the only thing I would drink. not a coffee drinker at all. I started buying Folgers Capachino, good but not as good as the Latte. I hope they don't stop putting it on shelves. I don't know what I'll do. but I am glad to see the Latte is still available online thru amazon. I hope it will continue to be."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I drink a lot of tea . When I say a lot I dont mean quantity but a lot of variety and this tea is on my top picks.This one gets me going in the morning . The aroma , The flavour , the strength is perfect . It is a little pricier for me at 10 $ for 15 bags . So I am always on the lookout for this one on sale at Wholefoods and when I see them on sale usually $6 I snap them all up."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"This product helped me immediately. I will definitely have to buy more so that I can stop switching them from shoe to shoe. I still have problems in the mornings when I first get out of the bed, but that's probably because I haven't done anything except buy the heel seats. I should do the exercises. I'm a little lazy. :-). Be Blessed and definitely by the HTP Heal Seats!"
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. She loves being right at the table with the rest of the family. She does not slip or slide off the seat. It is very comfortable, roomy and makes her feel like a big girl. I would definately recommend this seat for moms/dads/grandparents!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,I ordered this tea to drink while pregnant because I have heard it helps with labor. I haven't gone into labor yet but it's good tea and nice to have a warm drink.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Towards the end of breastfeeding my son, I began taking 'Fenugreek' and 'Blessed Thistle'. It really brought my milk supply back, the only issue was that I smelled like Maple syrup. I didn't really have an issue - it was just strange."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This is a nice protein that mixes really easy. The taste was odd at first, but I got used to it. I use it for a before bed Low calorie supplement. It has the lowest level of the bad stuff such as cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury vs Muscle Milk and the EAS products. Thats the big selling point for me"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Towards the end of breastfeeding my son, I began taking 'Fenugreek' and 'Blessed Thistle'. It really brought my milk supply back. There was a noticeable difference if I skipped taking 'Blessed Thistle'."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"I got the medela free-style pump and these shields come with the pump. After using the pump a few times, I noticed that I had a blister on my areola! My son and I had not changed anything, so I did not think that it was our routine or set up, but I made an appointment with a lactation consultant just in case. When I showed her the blister, which had popped at this point, she said that it was definitely from the pump shields. She said she hated the softfits and had seen this in other moms as well who used these shields. She recommended switching to the hard plastic shields, which I did, and I have had a much more comfortable experience since. They may be more comfortable for some, but beware the blisters!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,1.0,"I tried this product for over two months and saw no reduction in hot flashes. What I found helps somewhat is taking Evening Primrose Oil capsules 3 times daily, along with a separate Black Cohosh supplements. Combined, those supplements cost about half as much as Remifemin and provide a good amount of relief from hot flashes. They are less frequent, less intense, shorter in duration and they don't wake me up at night anymore. If one supplement doesn't help you, try something else - everyone's body is different in how it responds to supplements."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,2.0,"For those who are sick of these shallow, sensory-driven reviews about the pure ecstasy that is Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, fret not.I won't be a hypocrite, and I can acknowledge that as you peer into every gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, it's nigh impossible to ignore the notes of history and culture that come wafting from its ribbed mouth. The shape of its vessel, the slight texture that begs its curves to be embraced... Such perfection can rarely be discovered in the mortal realm, much less delivered in 3-7 business days.I digress. I have never before reviewed a product from the Amazon, and I must choose my words carefully. Time is of the essence, and this will almost certainly be the last message I have the privilege to share with you.We've all been led to believe that, behind every good milk, there is a man. This is where the fairy tale has been blurred throughout time, with personal agendas and blasphemy. It is my duty to set things straight.That man is Thomas Edison.Suspend your disbelief. You've been led to believe that Edison invented the light bulb? I beg that you take this speculation with a grain of salt. He is an evil, manipulative individual, with ties to the most corrupt milk-running circle that has ever existed.You may notice that I referred to his qualities in the present tense. Ah, so you were also taught that he is no longer living? Please. Shut your textbooks and open your eyes. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, though now diluted with the nasty udder discharge from cattle, was once an elixir of immortality, developed by none other than Mr. Sparky the Light-Bulb-Face himself. It was all a cover, don't you see? Teachers and researchers love to focus on the 1,093 patents that Edison acquired (before he went into hiding, that is). They fail to mention, however, that most of these inventions were, in fact, instruments of torture. Their sole purpose was extracting information from the real inventors of the time. As they were beaten, stretched, and impaled, the inventors' tears were collected in a plastic jug, and were subsequently mixed with a supply of cow's milk, as his daily dose of creativity and calcium.I can hear his footsteps coming down the stairs. I must get to the point, or all of this will have been in vain.Our understandings of the origins of modern electricity are flawed, the product of countless bribes and hush money. The nutrition that fuels the white magic in your breakfast cereal is, in fact, the repressed and concentrated imagination and talent of countless inventors and scientists.Don't go to the police. He owns the police.Your only hope is the one man who escaped! He and he alone can tell you how to put an end to this! Find Nikola Te-"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,4.0,"Coconut water is IMO much better than sports drinks and as equally refreshing. It can be consumed any time without feeling guilty. Vita Coco is good, I just don't understand why it comes from the Phillipines but Born in Brazil?I know when I was in Brazil you could get cocunut water dirt cheap right out of the nut. The fruit grows everywhere, but it's not cheap like a banana. My recommendation would be to sell this by the gallon instead of small containers. I would be more inclined to purchase if the price was better. The quality still seems good, though. After all, it's all natural?"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"The stores in my area do not carry these cough drops, so I've been ordering them online for years. They are the only thing that quiets my persistent cough caused by mild asthma. And they taste pretty good -- a bonus, as far as I'm concerned."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"this is the best tasting spaghetti, I would highly reccomend it. I wish they would sell the seasoning mix seperatley so i could use it for other sauces."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Got these for my Airedale, per the vet's recommendation that he should take a dose of glucosamine/chondroitin, each day. These are a good value."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"I don't like BBQ sauce that much, but my husband loves it. Our diet doesn't allow us to have the caloric stuff anymore so I thought I'd try this one out. It does have a strong hickory smoked flavor and smell to me, but my husband said it was quite good and wants me to order it by the case. If he had written the review it would have gotten 5 stars."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"Graber olives are simply the best. They are also expensive and have limited availability . . . Hard to find. Are they worth the price and bother? You have to judge that for yourself. I think so. They are tree ripened and have a flavor that brings new sensations of the Earth, and the Olive tree itself. Buy a can of the jumbo's and see what you think."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This brush is perfect for Dr. Brown and other bottles. The nipple cleaner works great on our Dr. Brown nipples. But the brush doesn't hold up that well and I am already on my second one in 6 mos. Then again, I wash a lot of bottles and it is fairly cheap."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"My supply really lessens in the evening. A fussy, tired baby and a low supply are a bad combination. I drink two cups a day, one at noon and one in the afternoon and I no longer have a baby who is fighting for food in the evening! If I forget to drink my tea, I always regret it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"If you are looking for something comparable to the Chai at you-know-where, skip this tea. I bought some after reading the reviews, but felt they really missed the mark. This tea should be simply called ""Cinnamon Tea""--that is the ONLY flavor I taste, and not at all like Chai. Imagine melted Red Hots dissolved in water, and that is about what this tea tastes like. I love Celestial Seasonings tea usually, but this one is really overpowering with the cinnamon flavor, which should be better pointed out on the box. I am going to try their India Spice tea based on other reviews, and will hopefully find something more complex like what I am looking for (and will hopefully be a nice substitute for the expensive Chai from Starbuck's)."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Chocolate Raspberry Luna Bars are so good, it's hard to believe they're good for you! Rich and satisfying, sweet and moist, yet made of all healthy ingredients. Amazon Subscribe and Save is the way to go"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"These are amazing patches, but I only gave them 3 stars because the product detail is wrong. It says they are 3 x 2 x 2. In reality, they are only about half that size and have less medication. I have had great success from using the larger patches on my lower back."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,"I was expecting something akin to cheese-flavored rice cakes. These were much tastier! Crunchier too. However, I was also expecting each bag to be the size of a small bag of potato chips. Wrong. The bags are just a little larger than those of gummy fruit snacks. Each mini round is about the size of a nickel and there aren't all that many in a bag. I bought the Classic White Cheddar ones, which I found to be very yummy. I just wish there were more to enjoy for the price."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My daughter turned me on to this product and I sure am glad she did! I last used this to get rid of an infection my cat had in her eyes. Put it in Lucy's eyes one day (one drop in the morning & one drop in the evening) and it cleared up an infection that usually requires an expensive ointment purchased at the vet's office. Awesome stuff!
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I'm pregnant on the first try! The ovulation tests worked perfectly. I was worried that I was receiving an evaporation line on the pregnancy tests, but looks like it was just positive. It worked as early as my First Response Early Pregnancy test which I used because I didn't trust these tests. They were all positive. So, I definitely recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,I know of several restaurants that serve very good falafel but this is the first mix that get's close to that. It's delicious and easy to make.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,This is the second time I use this product because after using different brands through the years this is the one that gives me the best results in energy and strength without any side affects. of course everyone is different so the results may vary. I would recommend to get a 50 or a 100 tablets bottle and if it works for you then get the 360tablets one.
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"My mother has had this set of three glass storage jars for probably 25 years. A gift from one of her sons. A few years ago one of the lids was dropped, broken, and glued back together. Looked pretty bad. I hopped on Amazon looking for a replacement jar and was amazed to see these jars that are exactly the same as my mother's old jars. Now she has her set of three jars with a perfect replacement."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I'm so disappointed that this product is discontinued. I totally love it. It works so well and smells so good. When I use what I have left and have been able to find on the Internet, I always get compliments about how good I smell and I am asked what I am wearing. Then I tell them I'm wearing bug repellent, no one believes me. True story."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"This is the most amazing product! If you need a good nights sleep or a little nap, this is the product for you. It so relaxing to put on and keeps you in the dark so that you can get that must deserved rest. Everyone should have Bucky!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I love this deodorant, This is strictly what I use. I love the pine smell of it, and unlike most natural deodorants I have tried this works amazing. I work in construction...and very rarely does this fail me.. and on the rare occasion that it does just another spray or two keeps me smelling fresh."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,I purchased this product hoping it would be as good as the Therabead pad I was retiring. It's not. It doesn't get nearly as hot or last as long. My Therabead pad would hold significant heat for about 30 minutes and moderate heat for another 10 or so. I only get about 15 minutes of moderate heat from the Thermalon bag. I tried heating it longer than instructed eventhough the instructions advise against it. That might have given me an extra 5 minutes. I will likely purchase the Therabead to use in the future.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm only doing this review because amazon keeps sending me emails about it, and hitting the ""report as spam"" button won't make them go away!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I LOVE this product, mixed with 100% lactose free/fat free milk. My favorite flavor is ""chocloate milk"". Taste like a milk shake! In fact, think I have one right now. Hold on..... Ahhhhh. Tha was greeeeat. Be sure to buy a protein shaker as well, and shake it until it's well mixed and a little foamy. I use it to keep my weight down on a low cal/high workout diet. (I initially found my muscles took too long to recover and I had those aches and pains. Thought it was old age, then my son suggested Muscle Milk, & I found Muscle Milk Light.) Turns out, I was missig just what's in this stuff"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I have really stiff joints. I sit at a computer all day so when I do get up from my chair, my legs and shoulders just hurt. I just turned 50 so perhaps that has a lot to do with it. Blue Emu has helped a lot and the best part is that it's odor free so I can put some on at the office and not smell like my grandmother used to smell (may she continue to rest in peace). It's not a miracle worker for me as I have to constantly reapply through the day, but it really does work so I will keep it around."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"Well the hint is very subtle, for as yet I have not found much of any taste of ginger. Mostly is is orange. If you are looking for a real ginger taste, get something else. This is misleading labeling and advertising"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,These bottle liners were good quality plastic and helped minimize the amount of air my baby swallowed. I would highly recommend them.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"This whey protein product seems to work as advertised. I drink a shake in the afternoon, and it helps me control my cravings, so I eat less in the evenings. So far I'm sticking to one scoop in 8 ounces of soy milk. After a while I may increase it to 2 scoops. The only problem I find is it tends to clump up easily, so it won't dissolve. In the blender is the way to go."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"It works - but I'd save your money and go with the cheap models. This is basically a cheap model with a high price :) It's not comfortable, my daughter doesn't really like sitting in it. But it works for what we needed."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,Stays nice and slippery for a while. Great for spanking your monkey when it's been a very bad boy.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I highly recommend this water bottle. It is holding up well, is easy to fill and keeps your bed nice and warm well in to the night. I would recommend a cover as it can be very hot at first but you will be happy with its durability and your warm toes on a winter night."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,i have used this product for about a week it is true it does not cause those cramps that other kinds of laxatives or stool softeners cause.give it a try you will not be disappointed love it..
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"If you Google ""Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein"" it won't take you long to find out that this stuff is one of the best bang-for-your-buck protein powders on the market. So the real question is, ""How does it taste?"" The cake batter flavor is OUTSTANDING... seriously tastes like yellow cake and makes my morning smoothies even better. I've been told all the other flavors are great as well, but I can definitely co-sign for CAKE BATTER."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I've tried quite a few protein powders, most of them whey-based. This is my favorite for a few reasons"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,1.0,Really really bad.All the other bars are so good we were looking forward to trying these.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I was very skeptical when I seen the ads for this on TV, but my wife was having problems with her lower back after a recent fall and I've had lower back problems for many years so I thought I'd give it a shot. Much to my surprise it does seem to help, it certainly doesn't get rid of all the pain and it's not a permanent fix, but it does seem to relieve the pain for periods of time and we now share the Light Relief while watching TV in the evening.I think it was well worth a try!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Yesterday, I bought one pack of 24 Oz the exact same item at a local Whole Foods store at $6.99. I don't want to buy the pack of 4 at a higher unit price here."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,4.0,"Hi everyone. I am a review checker, but never have the time to actually write one for the products I purchase. I got this a couple months ago and am very pleased. It does beep like everyone says letting you know that it is ""working"" my DH sleeps right through it but I try to keep it quiet holding it while it is temping. I like the feature that it lights up & saves our temp just encase you forget to write it down.I haven't had any errors with the device itself just user errors...like actually remembering to get up and take my temp...or not to get out of bed and start my day w/o temping.I wish everyone the best of luck out there getting their BFP's!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,I'd like it to be a little more heavier and therefore more sturdy. So far I liked it and would recommend to others. I actually saw many restaurants use excactly the same highchair as this one.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I have tried SEVERAL bottle brushes since my son was born and this is THE BEST ONE!!!! I have had this one for about 4 months and since it is a strong plastic and not wire, it hasn't broken and the suction cup keeps it upright to eliminate germs and it has a nipple cleaner brush INSIDE! This thing is awesome!"
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"This thermometer gives a fast reading and seems to be accurate. The probe is small so it easily fits under the tongue. The electronics part is quite a bit heavier and sits out fromo the probe so there's a bit of a lever trying to pull down on the part outside of your mouth. So, I find that it's a bit difficult to keep it stationary while it takes the reading (I just hold it). It beeps when the temperature readiing is complete but I do find the beep to be too quiet so I have trouble hearing it. The thing is easy to clean since it it has a fully covered body (except for the probe tip but that seems fully bonded to the body); I would not suggest immersing the whole thing into water."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I was having a lot of problems with dust allergens as I was rearranging our living room furniture. I am allergic to dust and I get the whole stuffy nose, and itchy/watery eyes deal. I purchased this product after countless reviews and have come to realize its value in my own home. One treatment and I was hooked! No more stuffy nose or itchy/watery eyes. In fact, I haven't had a bad allergy episode in months!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Love these things....can't find these flavors in the stores. Amazon price only slightly higher than buying directly from the store, but well worth it since they (local groceries) seem to only carry 2 flavors at any given time."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I bought this product because its organic and contains dark chocolate chips. While quite tasty, I cannot recommend for use on the trail, because it would melt and make a big mess at high temperatures. It's a good bar to consume before playing tennis or some other sport. Has a higher sugar content than some other bars, but no artificial or fake ingredients."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These and the Whole Foods are my favorite whole vitamins, and I use whichever of them is available where I am shopping. Really like the capules...they are so much easier to swallow and no doubt about whether they dissolved and were absorbed."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I was hesitant to purchased these bags, reading so many reviews of them leaking. Yet we went ahead and put them on our registry, and I have used about 100 in the last 7 months (part time pumper). Most of the bag we have only had frozen for 1-3 weeks, and I thawed them on the counter or under running warm water with out any problems. Once the milk is thawed I typically transfer it to a bottle right away, but I have also pumped and dumped it into the bag for transport home and that has been fine too. I would recommend these bags as we have never had a leaker.I would caution that you need to take care when pouring from the bag to a bottle, it is something that takes 2 hands- and my partner has spilled some milk. I don't think that this issue is specific to these bags, just storage bags in general."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Your coffee will taste strong and bitter, but you can still add more water to dilute it to taste like a fresh brewed cup. So when the label of this 3.53 oz. jar says it makes 60 cups believe it. I'm used to whole bean organic coffee made fresh in my grind & brew coffee maker. Honestly if I were blindfolded and the stevia and milk were added, I doubt I'd be able to tell them apart. I'm really pleasantly surprised and grateful since I have 6 jars of this high quality freeze dried organic coffee that tastes GRRREAT! Also at my local organic store it's over 8 bucks a jar, so this is a deal. I bought it mainly for travel purposes and for when my area has hurricane season's electrical outages."

Other mixes we have tried tasted flat and sparce on flavor. Outside of being a little pricey, we think it's the best on the market."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"The oil smells lovely, but is not quite what I expected. I have a sandalwood sculpture as well as sandalwood incense and the oil doesn't smell like them. It may be that the oil is too concentrated and will smell more like sandalwood when used. At the moment it smells a great deal like pine."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,I really enjoy this soup. It is not salty and makes a very good lunch. Not homemade but good.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,No idea why such a great company will add annetto coloring into a health productand no idea why the list of ingredients is so difficult to find and readI bought this and recommend not to do like me :-)
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Was unable to find parts in Target, Wal mart or even Babies R Us. Found it on Amazon. Good price. BRAND NEW. Shipped fast with another product. Very very very happy. Recommend."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"I am in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and to have found these is just awesome to me! I was prescribed some tablets to take but they make me really drowsy, no good with a 3yo running around! Quick relief so far.. making life a little more bearable :) Pharmacist said they are safe during pregnancy so long as you take as directed. Music to my ears! Would recommend these to anyone in my boat!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I don't go in for herbal remedies. When I'm sick, I grab some Robitussin or Sudafed, and that's that. If this has any legitimate medicinal value, it's just a nice bonus. From my standpoint, this is just a Damned Good Tea!It's got an unlikely minty licorice taste to it, which has really grown on me. I haven't found this taste in any other tea. The aroma is wonderful, and it cools the nose like a subtle eucalyptus, though that's not present in the taste. While it makes a great hot tea, it really shines for iced tea. I use one bag per 18oz or so, rather than the one bag per 12oz I'd normally use for iced tea brewing, and this works quite well. In addition to the refreshing taste, that coolness in the nose and the throat makes a great hot weather refreshment."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"My product was shipped right and received right away. This is a great price compared to what I had previously paid at the Health Food Stores. You have to make sure you get the dosage right because if you take too much you will end up sleeping through your alarm.Overall, a great product/price"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,4.0,"I take these on long runs. I typically don't eat before I go. The blocks curb the hunger, boost, the energy, and most of all don't create the need for a potty break.It's sweet and chewy. If you're running in heat, they get gooey. You might need to take two bites of each bite since they take some time to chew up and they occupy alot of space in your mouth."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"This tea is rather foul tasting (and smelling). It tastes like what I imagine cologne tastes like. The smell is sickly sweet and nausea inducing. I love vanilla, I love chai, I love tea...but this was just awful."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,Bought this for my wife who needs something to block out the world before she can fall asleep--without disturbing me. This does the job perfectly. She uses it every night.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Make your own shakes with this. Almost tasteless. Add fructose crystals, sugar-free kool aide, a little salt, whey protein powder, etc...all great. Energy from this is perfect, consistent and steady, no spikes or let downs. Use it when exercising for over one hour. Great value vs. the gels. Mixes well if you start with room temp. or warm water, and then add ice. Otherwise can clump up."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"This is a terrific product. I can't imagine any lancet or lancet system being any easier to use or less painful. Accu-Chek products are excellent, fairly priced and are highly supported by Roche, the manufacturer. They offer excellent newsletters and advice through a toll free number. Their Accu-Chek 360 software is a great product as well."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,There are many types of honey mustard pretzel but the Snyder Honey Mustard pieces are the best most flavorful and satisfying to me others just don't compare and are lightly flavored in comparison. I LOVE them.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,5.0,The name is correct...it is a burst of lemon flavor. I like to put a big squirt of it in a mug of hot water and add a spoonful of honey. Makes a wonderful hot drink.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was surprised to see that I purchased these less than two weeks ago. They're GONE, all gone!I thought I would put them in granola, yoghurt, etc and I did ...once or twice... but I just ended up eating handful upon handful.I like to chew ;) And after a friend of mine asked me if I'd ever had ""Jolly Ranchers' jelly beans -- which I am sure are great -- I declared that these are nature's jelly beans!And boy nature done good.Thus I am here to purchase more and am subscribing for them monthly for now... at least until my addiction slows and I can make these last more than a couple weeks!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"Unless you're the type of guy who only needs a few minutes, you'd be better off with liquid silk or maximus. Astroglide starts to get sticky pretty quick. Really annoying for a marathon 30 minute++ session with your sweetie."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,5.0,"GABA Calm works well for me. I do not use it every day, but typically rely upon it to help me wind down after a fun-filled day of stress when I'm forced to drive in crazy traffic on one of the more dangerous highways in the Western U.S., be on time to appointments, work with and for people who are impossible to please and stop by a crowded grocery store before making the long commute home on the same dangerous highway (typically after dark, which makes for a more nerve-wracking experience). After a day like this, no matter how physically and emotionally exhausted I may feel, it takes at least three hours for me to ""wind down"" enough to even think about falling asleep. This is often less than optimal, particularly when I arrive home at 11 PM and am expected to be showered, wide awake and fully functional by 8 AM. After days like I've described, six hours or less of sleep is simply not enough recovery time. I'm ragged, weary and occasionally even surly all day.Using GABA Calm cuts my ""wind down time"" to half or a third of this average. Because it is made for sub-lingual use, it works quite rapidly. I've taken to carrying a few in a pill fob as ""back up"", so I can put one under my tongue about 30 minutes before arriving back at the farm and already be starting to ""chill"" as I park. One tablet effects me sufficiently that it seems best to be off the road before the full effect kicks in. The Peppermint is refreshing; tastes good. I like the sub-lingual delivery, although anyone using this often might find a bit of irritation under the tongue developing and may choose to move it between gums and cheek to avoid any soreness. With this delivery method, it is very difficult to formulate any pill (or extract or hard candy, for that matter) that can be used every single day, multiple times per day and avoid irritation inside one's mouth.GABA Calm also helps significantly reduce irritability (fast!) in a friend who has issues with moderate to severe chronic pain who's sometimes a bit temperamental and has difficulty getting a good night's rest. In my friend's case, a full-spectrum B-vitamin supplement plus vitamin D and Calcium are added to the mix. We've both noticed it improves feelings of well-being that seem to stick around the next day. GABA Calm works. It is a good value and a terrific product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Fair enough, many people dislike this tea because the dominant taste is fennel, but I'm not one of them. I love this tea and am delighted that I found it for such a great price here on Amazon. The appealing taste actually makes me look forward to fasting days. It also really works (suppressing appetite). It's like my fasting-day treat. Delicious."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had been eating pumpkin seeds for magnesium for a while, but there are times when I want to get the mineral without a bunch of added calories (like late at night before bed). This stuff is great for that. It doesn't upset my stomach like a magnesium pill sometimes can, and it tastes good, and has no sugar. Maybe it is just placebo effect, but it seems like my teeth are smoother after I swish it around in my mouth for a while. Also, it sometimes helps me relax. I certainly will continue to buy it regularly. I recommend it to my family but none of them listen to me; their loss!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I have used this Amino Vital product for several years now....always the best! It works the best taken during and after long endurance or high intensity workouts. I love using this product during marathons, century rides or simply hard training days. I NEVER use GU or any products like that...only Amino Vital!"
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,4.0,I like this product when used with a rotation of other psoriasis products. Doesnt irritate more. But have to use in combination with other products.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"The coconut oil product is fine, but the packaging made using this product an awful experience. The container isplastic & so cheaply made that the oil leaks after the seal is broken... to the point it makes a mess in the kitchen. The only answer is to put the contents into another container.I will not purchase it again for this reason.Instead, I am buying Nutiva brand (64 oz.) in a heavy plastic jar with a good quality screw top lid. Much better choice at only a few pennies more."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"We bought this for our five-month-old so he could sit with us at the table. He really likes being able to see what's going on. It's very comfortable for him and provides enough support so that he doesn't fall to the side since he can't fully sit up by himself just yet.It's great for us too when we need to do things in the kitchen such as wash dishes or prepare dinner (we just move the kitchen chair around that the high chair is mounted to). Only complaint is that the straps are quite stiff and a little awkward around the shoulder. A couple of times he has grabbed them and started sucking them, although there aren't many things he won't put in his mouth at this age.A bonus is that the arms are compatible with the activity bar/arch that we have, so if he gets bored watching mommy and daddy we can mount the arch on the chair and he can entertain himself.Overall great chair, recommend it."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,1.0,"Some friends mailed me a bag of diet jelly beans they had perched on a tour through the Jelly Belly plant in California. It was a marshmallow size bag with a warning label about the size of a small return address sticker with more printing on it. I'm in good health and thought it was a ""carbohydrate warning"" I didn't have my glasses with me.I ate about 30 beans then my wife and went to a meeting after about an hour in I was sick. My wife also was sick even thou she had eaten less than I."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,It works to help drown out the television and loud conversations of noisy neighbors so I can get to sleep with a quiet air type of humming. Not a harsh sound like a loud waterfall or annoying white noise from a television. A great value for the price. I was unnecessarily tormented for years. Now I get to sleep!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I am a classically-trained singer with Type I diabetes, and I recently finished up a year learning a little about singing in contemporary styles. Over-singing suddenly became a big problem. I used to use honey in hot water to sooth my irritated throat, but that spiked my blood sugar, which in turn dehydrated me and my vocal folds - and that was completely counterproductive.My voice teacher turned me on to Yogi Throat Comfort, and I haven't gone back. Granted, honey tastes better; this tea has a very strong licorice taste that is almost unpleasant. It isn't anything I would reach for if I wanted to enjoy a cup of tea. However, it soothes an irritated throat EVERY BIT as well as honey, and even though I've stopped studying contemporary styles and don't have to worry so much about over-singing anymore, I still turn to this tea at the first sign of a scratchy throat. I've had colds that dropped my speaking voice more than an octave or left me essentially unable to speak, and this tea is an important part of a regimen that enables me to keep singing anyway.Have one of those now, in fact, which is why I'm back here to order more. :)"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"The best on the market as far as i am concerned, and I have tried a lot of others. It is comfortable and VERY absorbent."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I purchased the neck and shoulder colpac, works great. stays cold for about 30 minutes. folds and smashes so i can cram it in my freezer. works for me."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have been in the health field for years and know brands and products. I also have smoked in the past and can tell you that within 30 minuets for me since my digestion is fast it starts to work by clearing excess mucus and swelling in my lungs and lympth nodes. It also has been studied for mentally ill people to help their brains detox. They did a study with 1 gram in morning and 1 gram at night for schizophrenics. I like this method of detox the best nice and clean and fast. As for the tinnitus there isnt anything that will help that I have it too best thing you can do is go with the flow and not fight the inevitable and your stress will go down. Learn to enjoy it. This brand is time release wich is unique. The only other brand I would suggest is solgar vegitarian.hope it helps you it has helped me alot. My mind is clearer too.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Never really gets hot, just stays a bit warm, not a good purchase for someone looking to remedy aches and pains. Past heating pads I've used were much more reliable at producing heat."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"These are old Avent containers. My box had a 2004 manufacture date. Avent didn't start producing the BPA-free containers until 2008. The new boxes say ""BPA-free"" on them and this one does not. Do not buy if you have concerns about using products with BPA."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"To make a long story short. I recently went back to Trinidad, the place I was born and have not returned to for over 15 years since I moved to Florida. Now, I had my fill of coconut water when I was in Trinidad, I mean, straight from the trees, roadside fresh cut coconuts, bottled, everything. I went back to my roots.Now, when I put that 100% VitaCoco to my head --- meh had ah flashback!!! Is ""Trinidad!"" meh bawl."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"I didn't notice much of a difference when I used this. I used it on a number of occassions (4 drops under the toungue) and it didn't really affect my nerves. Looking at the ingredients, it contains 27% alcohol along with all the other natural stuff so I wasn't sure how much of the herbs were working vs. the alcohol. I wouldn't disregard it as a possible solution, but for folks with true anxiety issues, I don't see this as a viable solution."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Had a horrible reaction to this pill! I saw spots all over, blood pressure went sky high, shakey, weak, felt awful1!! I will NEVER take this pill again!!!!!!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,2.0,"Thursday does not list the amount of oil mixed with the cream, it seems the amount is minuscule. Comparing the oil to the cream, I prefer the oil a whole lot better. The cream overall is OK, not great, and moisturizes the skin for a couple of minutes then goes away. As a test, for one week I applied only the cream. I found I had to apply it multiple times to gain the benefits equal to yet not as close as straight oil. The following week, I tried mixing the oil with body lotion but found the oil thinned the mixture to a water like WD-40 consistency. My best results has been to apply the oil first, waiting five minutes then applying body lotion.The antiseptic medicinal/herbal aroma is not as strong as the oil yet noticeably present. I apply it at night and surely would not go out in public with the either product on. Ever get a whiff of someone wearing hippie patchouli oil? El stink-o!I would not recommend this product as the co$t to value ratio is minute. Get the oil then apply body lotion after. Best bang for the buck$."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I like it and drink it once each night with my girlfriend. I gift this to my girlfriend's mom and my mom via UPS. :) this is great tea to share and gift.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,1.0,"Seriously, if you are going to try a cookie diet you have to use R&D; Diet Cookie. They are WAY cheaper and I think they work and taste better. I suggest you use them to lose your initial 10 to 30 lbs then change the program a little. Instead of the low 800 calories per day, eat a couple for breakfast and maybe even lunch then just make better food choices for the rest of the day. Also, have them for a late night snack. You will still lose weight but it will be a little slower but a lot easier.R&D; Cookie Diet Meal Replacement Cookies - 2 weeks Assorted FlavorsI also wanted to mention I tried all 3 (Hollywood, seigal, smart for life) at one time or another... all tasted OK but still left me a little hungry. I simply believe the R&D; Diet Cookies work better. More science behind them."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I drank this tea for the first time this morning. It was quite tasty! It had a hint of chocolate flavor (from the carob I'm sure). Didn't notice any dramatic results but I will keep drinking it to see how it turns out. I even added a bit of honey since I enjoy that in my tea/coffee. But you almost don't need to add any sweetener.UPDATE
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"After 11 months of trying for baby #2, I decided to buy the Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor. It had me start testing on day #6 (day #1 being 1st day of normal flow) and it showed low that day, then it showed high days 7 - 12 and peak on days 13 - 14! My husband and I did our thing on days 11, 13, & 14. Today is day 26 and I took a First Response early pregnancy test and it was positive!!! Glorious! Apparently our timing has just been all wrong this whole time....ever since the birth of our first child a year and a half ago (who I got pregnant with the 3rd month of ""just seeing what happens""), I have been having about 10 day periods (about 5 days of brown spotting followed by a regular period). I would count the first day of spotting as day #1 of my cycle, so we were actually trying too early in my cycle. I saw my doctor about my cycle & its relationship to me not getting pregnant a few months ago and he said to just give it time & track my temperature. Well, my temperature was all over the place and I couldn't tell a thing from it. Ironically, I went to see him again at the beginning of this cycle and he gave me a prescription for clomid that I would have started taking the beginning of my next cycle....but thanks to the fertility monitor I do not have to take any drugs! And this baby will be due right around Christmas :) Merry Christmas to me! I sincerely wish you all the best of luck and hopefully my story will give other women hope!! God bless!(P.S. I did some shopping around and Amazon by far had the lowest price for the fertility monitor and test sticks at the time)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Really deep sleep when I take these ZMA's especially on an empty stomach. It really helps me through a cutting phase of my diet when hunger is kicking in, I take 3 and it puts me in a deep sleep ready to wake up and go to work the next day. I also find and trust that most all Optimum Nutrition products have a perfect mix of value/quality for what you pay when compared to the other products out there."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Nothing special to review with this product. I have not noticed any difference since using it, good or bad."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,1.0,Did not get results any better than if I had used Miralax or Metamucil. I even get better from my fiber bars and they taste good!
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,The item I bought from Amazon was discribed accurate and sent in a timely mannor.I have purchased many items from Amazion and will do in the future.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,5.0,"Red Bull sugar free is the best. No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.I used to drink regular Red Bull but I found that my eyes would really hurt from all of the sugar and that there would be a pretty substantial crash a few hours after consumption. I typically drank one a day. I guess you can say that I may have a Red Bull addiction.Since switching to Red Bull Sugar Free, there is no crash and none of that funky eye pain mid-day; and since it is sugar free it's got less calories. That's my justification at least :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This totally helps me sleep. The taste and smell take some getting used to but that is possible. After all wine didn't taset good the first time I drank it but I like the way that makes me feel too. I now enjoy wine and Valerian Root Tea. If you have any trouble falling asleep I totally reccomend this product.
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,2.0,"I can't compare these pacifiers to others because they're the only kind we've given to our newborn daughter. She takes them and doesn't seem to have a problem with them. I have a few complaints though- they accumulate gunk where the pacifier attaches, water gets inside the pacifier part when we boil them, and they leave marks on my daughter's cheeks. And because they're so tight against her cheeks, her cheeks are red and moist after she spits it out. I'm going to switch to a different product before they give her a rash. Definitely do not get these pacifiers."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"Love this product. Great for attatching to any chair. It is secure, space-saving, and very eady to install. I would highly recommend this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"This product does NOT deserve ONE star. Like all placebo diet aids Hoodia is a waste of money and time. If you are NOT going to Africa and actually taking Hoodia directly from the Hoodia plant chances are you are either not getting PURE Hoodia and/or you are receiving the lowest quantity. Remember that the U.S. does not regulate many of the chemical and ""natural"" diet aids on the market today. If you read the fine print on these products it states that the product has NOT been approved by the FDA. Now whether that is a good or bad thing the fact of the matter is that one is better off spending their money on a medical doctor or nutritionist that can test and determine if or what type of medication is needed to provide safe and monitored weight loss. Years earlier, I was informed by a Science Professor that WHEY protein was once considered as a massive and disgusting run-off that ended up in the sewer. Because there was tons of this sludge someone came up with the idea to sell it as a muscle building, weight loss infusing body builders/athletes dream shake that sold and continues to be sold by the millions. Wow. Remember people, we live in a Marketers world. Every and anything can and will be sold. Hoodia yesterday, Acai today, and disgusting GMO fused WHEY in the past. It's all propaganda. Guaranteed we will be confronted again and again with the next superfruit from some exotic place that claims once again to provide miraculous results. Don't believe the Lies! Also those claiming to have gained maximum positive results from this product and the heart racing and dangerous side effects from the others should really be scrutinized and researched where and who exactly are behind those posts. Buyer Beware."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I try and get my kids to eat vegetables but they definitely don't get their daily required amount. I buy the Animal Parade probiotic vitamins for my kids and came across these. These are tasty little vitamins that my kids love taking. These are a great way to help fill in the missing veggies from their diet. Of course I know it would be better for them to actually eat all their veggies but since they don't, these are a great supplement. They are the size of a Flinstone's chewable and the kids ask for them daily."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I love this cup! The handles made it easy for my son to hold by himself. I couldn't get him to switch to any other sippy cup after the bottle. I had a bunch of cheap/free sippy cups but he wouldn't use any of them. Most of them required too much sucking or had a difficult mechanism. I had a little sticker shock at first. This cup is a lot more expensive than others but when you are trying to transition from bottle to cup and this one works, who cares! The opening at the top was also too small and he couldn't get enough milk but I just cut the hole a little bigger and it works great!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,3.0,"I was under the impression that this was the 'starter pack'. It was not. It was the capsules without the book or case. I could have paid less for just capsules. This description was completely inaccurate. On a plus side, it was shipped on time and the pills do work wonders as long as you eat properly."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"Terrible. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I've had a number of protein bars and I don't know what people who say these taste great are eating, because they are terrible. If you want a good protein bar, go with PURE Protein. You can get the peanut butter ones with 33g of protein and they taste fantastic, almost like a candy bar. DO NOT BUY THESE."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"These are one of the few breakfast bars that actually fill me up and get me ready for the day until lunch. The flavors are outstanding, and the consistency is that of a home made cookie. All in all, a great start to the day."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Pamela's Products Baking & Pancake Mix 4 lbI just love this product, one of the absolute best gluten-free mixes out on the market today. The fact that Amazon bundles three packs of a 4 lb. bag just makes it that much more worthwhile to buy it right here. I save so much more money buying it this way. Best buy!!"

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,This large size heating pad is very satisfying. The price is very reasonable. I only wish the cord that is attached to the pad itself was not so stiff. But I would recommend this heating pad and would purchase another if needed.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,THIS IS A GREAT DEAL!! ITS THE BEST CAPPUCCINO AROUND BUT HARD FOR ME 2 FIND!!! HERE U CAN GET A 6-PACK EVERY MONTH & ITS CHEAPER THAN THE STORE!! ~~~~~~~~~~~A+++++++++++++~~~~~~~~~~
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,I liked the style of this ring. I wish I had gotten it in a bigger size. I was wearing this ring every day - it now leaves a mark on my thumb (the finger that I wanted it for). Would not buy this again.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I bought the cookie N cream energy bar. I work out about 6 hours a day. This bar really help me get through my workouts but I definitely drink a lot just to get the bar in me. Without water, I CAN NOT get it in no matter how hard I try. The ""cookie"" just gets stuck in my throat. It doesn't taste like cookie but some black solid dots. Without water this bar taste like sugary mud. If you are someone who value energy over taste, then this bar is definitely a 5 star but to me, the taste and texture really dropped a star for me."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"So happy to have found these low carb snack packs. Tasty, crunchy, and guilt free. The individual serving packs are great for brown bag lunches as well as ensuring you only each one serving."

Great with a glass of cold milk or a hot cup of coffee. I thought these would last for months.REVIEW:1 - PACKAGING
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"These may work for some feet but they did not work for mine. The ""arch support"" was like the princess and the pea. A foam pad with a large rubber pea stuck underneath where the arch would be. Did not feel too bad in the morning just starting out but within an hour of standing I had to take them out. I had expected more comfort when I ordered these since I already have a 3/4 pair of SPENCO's that work very well. But they are made with a hard molded shell under the foam pad that contour nicely to my arch. These are made totally of the foam padding. Needless to say I will not be ordering arch supports online without an exact item number that I know is what I want. They come ample sized and had to be trimmed to fit in my shoe (women size 9.5)."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I LOVE the Peanut Butter Builder's bars. While Amazon is great for so many things, a trip to TJ's is too good to pass up. A little cup of coffee, a sample or two and into the cart with some fresh vegetables and whatever else is irresistible that day. Life doesn't get much better. If TJ's weren't local (perish the thought!), i'd order the bars from Amazon. With Amazon's sales volume, 2-day FedEx delivery and a sheltered place for the packages when they arrive, freshness hasn't been a problem."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I absolutely adore anything cherry. I bought this tea in the sampler fruit package of teas. I was curious how this would taste. My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea is Lemon Zinger. This is a close tie. I know everyone says ""you don't even need sugar"" but I use sugar.I have not seen this tea sold by the box in my local store. When I run out, I'll definitely buy it here.I also just can't say enough about the packaging!! It's so beautiful I don't want to throw it away!!Before I was introduced to Celestial seasonings I'd wrinkle my nose up at the idea of me drinking tea. These teas have converted me! Heck, I'm even planning on switching from using refined white sugar in my tea."
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,"The product came quite quickly, but when I used it the first time I realized that the container had a leak and puffs of the powder would shoot out when I put it down on the counter. I have had to put it in an airtight plastic bag in hopes that it doesn't get damaged from humidity."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"This high chair is really cute, and I LOVE the bar between their legs in the front, so you don't absolutely have to use the straps (if you don't have a climber, that is). But the material is not machine washable. Who on earth decided that a baby high chair would be a good ""dry clean only"" item? Really bad choice on that side. But that being said, I've had this chair for 3 years, and washed it in my machine on the gentle cycle. While the padding under the bum is all bunched up (we put a towel at the bottom now to make it comfortable), the rest has actually held up fine to the washings. We've also only hung it to dry. Overall, cute product that is a pain to clean."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,Just the right amount of spice (spicy!) the texture of the noodles was great and it was delicious. I wish they were cheaper but our entire family loves these. My only problem is the amount of carbs and salt but at least the fat was a huge amount lower than packaged noodle soups. (3g a bowl vs about 12g+ for many other brands). I'll buy these again. Great food storage item when you can get a deal on them. :)
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,I liked that the product is natural with lessharmful chemical fillers.But I didn't notice any added health benefitfrom taking the L-Lysine.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I liked this item very much. It's not perfect. Some people may be put off by the texture of the inside of the bar. But I wasn't. It reminded me of Halvah. There was a distinct smell and taste of strawberries as I ate the bar. It overpowered the dark chocolate by a bit. But, the mix of the dark chocolate and strawberries was good. I would recommend this product to those who like strawberries and a coarse texture."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"I ordered Boylan's Original Birch Beer, the 12 pack, from Amazon. And the seller did a decent job packaging the bottles. All the bottles arrived intact and safely, and within a good timeframe from when I placed the order. I was first introduced to birch beer when my sister and I dined at Schlafly Bottleworks in St. Louis. My sister and I tried Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer and ginger beer. This brand also has root beer. I liked the birch beer better than the ginger beer. My sister and I thought the taste of the Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer was excellent and amazing. It's similar to root beer or cream soda, but different, unique, and yummy! The problem is that it's very hard to find Lewis Osterweis & Sons' birch beer. You can drink bottles of it at Schlafly Bottleworks or buy some from their giftshop or try to find some bottles at some other places in St. Louis, but other than that, you're kind of out of luck. I went on Amazon, and out of the birch beer products offered, the Boylan brand stood out. I went on Boylan's website and read how these New Jersey-based birch beers have been their ""flagship"" products for more than 100 years. I like how the birch beer is made with natural cane sugar. I've been a fan of Boylan's other drinks, but I didn't try their birch beer until recently. It's a nice birch beer, and it's great to share these bottles with your friends and family. I give a big thumbs up to this product!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"The product is backed by the Great Dane Lady, but from my experience, there just wasn't enough improvement in my dog for me to purchase this again."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,"The price was great. However these are very bad for compatibility, and they are very leaky. Even on Evenflow bottles these leaked liked crazy. I ended up throwing these away after two weeks trying to find the right combo that didn't drench my kids neck. I tried evenflow, medela, gerber, and parents choice bottles. LEAKED In all of them. This is a great price for nipples, and you might think you should stockpile ( I did, I bought a dozen) but it's not worth it, you get what you pay for. My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples. Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS. In fact, we noticed no gas too, we switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce, 3 Pack (Colors Vary)as our main bottle. The nipple ring is tight and the nipple is stiff, the bottle design prevents nipple collapse and makes airflow work in the perfect combo so that he never got a gassy tummy again. Spend the money, buy the good stuff."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Wish this had worked for me, as Dr. Oz purports it to help low back pain and inflammation. But it felt like a devil's claw going through my digestive system for hours. Yike."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Great product! Lives up to the claims. I have used it on scratches, dry skin, my psoriasis, and my son's athletes foot. Fantastic results... and it decreased my son's foot odor...a total bonus!!! Also great for burns, after the burning process is over, haven't tried it on fresh burns yet......"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,"I buy a lot of coffee. I wouldn't consider myself a gourmet, but some members of my family are. I try different kinds of coffee, buying Illy as gifts for the kids because they love it.I've tried others that are cheaper, not as good as Illy, but certainly good.This coffee is more expensive than Illy and it is totally hum drum.We were so unimpressed that we resented having spent the money on something mediocre when we might have gotten something delicious.The one star does not mean the coffee tastes as bad as Maxwell House or Folgers, for example. But because it costs so much more than it is worth."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This supplement is the absolute best zinc available. I was unable to grow fingernails, as my protein absorption was weak until I started taking this supplement. Now I am trimming fingernails, and the protein absorption is enabling me to engage in a risky sport I thought I'd have to give up for lack of muscle strength.All zinc is hard on the stomach - makes you nauseous. This zinc is less likely to cause nausea than any I've tried. Don't take any zinc in the morning, and take this with the largest meal of the day."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"The first few months I got negatives (wasn't pregnant) and this month I first tested the day before my period was due (13 DPO) and got a positive (so it probably would have even showed faintly sooner than that). I also tested with the First Response and got a positive too to double check. Now it is 19 DPO and I have a dark line almost the same as the control.I do have to note that I took a few tests for fun at the same time to see the consistency of the line darkness and they did vary in intensity (one was super light). Not a big deal because if you get a line it's a positive, but could make a difference if you are testing super early.They work and the only reason to pay more for a name brand is if you want a pretty picture with it (hey I did it!)."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I know this product will not be right for everyone, but I have to say I absolutely love it. I have a recurring problem with my T2-T3 vertebrae becoming misaligned for practically no reason - I bend over and pick something up or reach for something at an odd angle and BANG! Instant pain. The only thing that has worked is a visit to my chiropractor (who I love) but at about $40 a visit, I try to limit how often I go.With this device, I simply lay it down and put the lumbar section (the higher end) right between my shoulder blades and pop! All better! YES I'm using it wrong, but because my issue is in an odd place, using it correctly doesn't work for me. This device is a life saver, I highly recommend it. Be super careful though, I can see how one could injure themselves with it easily. Just pay attention to your body and go slow. Rolling off onto my side slowly is the best way I have found to ""dismount"" the device when I use it as directed."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton. I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton. Until now. I am officially an Americolor convert. These colors are so amazingly vibrant! And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT. They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again. I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I learned about this product while searching for a way to get off of Prilosec OTC naturally. My family doctor told me I had acid reflux and put me on acid blockers (Prilosec, Protonix) for three years and every time I tried to get off of it, I felt the acid coming up in my throat and my stomach hurt. I knew my body was used to taking the acid blockers and I also knew what the acid blockers do - they stop your stomach from producing acid. So, when you try to get off of any of the acid blockers, what does your body do? It produces more acid and it makes you very uncomfortable.Well, Mastica is the answer. I took this for about two months along with Rhizinate and my symptoms of acid reflux went away! I also stopped drinking coffee and watched what I ate.This is a great product for a natural remedy for acid reflux and it actually helps heal the stomach lining. It's a natural product from the bark of a tree in Greece and has been used in Greece for thousands of years! I would recommend this to anyone suffering from acid reflux."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,This product arrived early and really does a good job on callus. I first learnedabout this product while having a pedicure
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This product was exactly as we expected and came in a timely manner. In fact, we received this product a day or so earlier than we had expected. It met our expectations. We would definitely recommend this seller to anyone....in fact, we can and will use them again for our needs. Thanks so much for this opportunity to review."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"arrived earlier then expected, and the price was the same price if I where to drive to the store including gas price to purchase the pills. Good seller"
health personal care,health care,women s health,2.0,"I tried this product after finishing up my last tub of the Source Naturals brand of progesterone cream. I was immediately turned off by the smell- it's not all that strong but the synthetic ""sweet wheat"" scent made me nauseous. I persisted and found that I just did not experience anywhere near the benefits/symptom relief that I did when using my usual. I'm glad I gave it a shot but will not repurchase."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"It really helps to have something to organize breast milk by date because my husband wont always search for the oldest first with 10-20 bags lying around in the freezer. Like other people have said, it wont hold the pre-frozen lansinoh bags though. I had to put them in kind of sideways. The box says you can use the top as well for storage so thats what i'm doing. Once I get through my older bags of milk, I will try putting new ones in the organizer to freeze rather than on the shelf and I'm sure they will fit fine then. I really like mine and actually bought another one for a friend. It could be better if it was like a cm wider."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We LOVE this chair. I was tired of the bulky high chair in our kitchen and this is the perfect solution. Our daughter loves to be a big girl in it and we know that our friends have one they bring camping and attach to picnic tables, we are looking forward to that this summer too. My only complaint is that under the handles that are on the surface it gets a little buildup from all the toddler spills and food. We would highly recommend this and are very happy with it overall."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"There wasn't enough scent in this whole bottle to make a baby smell good. This was a nicely labeled bottle, however the contents are worthless. A HUGE waste of hard earned money. A complete rip-off. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! arrrrggggg :("
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,This is the best breakfast if you want quick oatmeal. It's sweet and healthy - the apples are in small chunks and it fills me up all morning. I was buying this at Target but having it delivered from Amazon is so much easier. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product and offering free shipping!
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,I bought this as I was sick of loosing sippy cups and such on road trips for the price this was wonderful on our last road trip. I could wash it up a few times but if she threw it and lost it I was not out $8 on a sippy cup. I will be buying and using for all long road trips the only way to go. Bowls to packages snacks and even kid size spoons.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,I could not continue taking the product. 4 pills that large is to many to take and it upset my stomach. I threw the product away. I chose this product after reading the review on a large choice of bone supplements.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"This item was part of a multi item order. Would have been nice to know upon ordering, rather than when the order was received, that the item is on back order."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"This was the first flavor I attempted making lollipops with and I couldn't get it right. I burned the sugar, or I would add too much or too little oil. So I can't say whether it was the oil or me, but I didn't LOVE it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I order this flavor regularly. It is one of my favorites. If you like the other Senseo pods and flavored coffee, then you will like this one too. It is smooth, not a strong flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,3.0,"I've been a long time user of Hydroxycut products before, and I can honestly say you will get results. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, you may be at risk of serious side effects. The first time I took Hydroxycut I had lost 20 lbs in a month. But despite my quick weight loss I had headaches often, maybe twice a week. And my heart would ""flutter"" during times where I'm at rest. The longer I've used the product I kept dropping weight which is great, but I started developing hives around my neck and on my arms. To this day I am still using this product because it DOES work for me, and the side effects are manageable and not yet serious.If you are considering this product, do some research first and look up the risk factors."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,4.0,"I put myself on a wait list, didn't get notified but ended up finding the 1025g jar at the International Market on Park Ave. in Memphis TN. I'm not sure if it is worth waiting for or not but our friend is going to love us for finding it. I'm now curious but don't dare open the jar."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The ""NOW"" brand received good reviews from a consumer board I belong to. The product is what it say it is... without contaminates. Price was competitive and the company runs sale prices regularly. I am also using another product by this company. I would recommend it for quality and price."
baby products,feeding,food,4.0,"This product follows the supermarket philosophy of first-in, first-out, making it easy to use the older milk first. Milk is stored in the fridge or freezer in a space-efficient way, in storage bottles with universal thread. They work perfectly with the Medela Pump in Style. As with another reviewer, I filled the 10 bottles very quickly, needing more. Ameda makes a storage bottle that fits this rack perfectly, for about $8 for a pack of 4 bottles. The 4 oz. Avent bottles also fit on the rack, but do take up more space, as the diameter is larger. My one complaint is how easily the Mothers Mate (and Ameda, for that matter) lids and bottles crack or shatter if a frozen bottle falls onto the floor. On more than one occasion, while pumping, I'd notice dripping, which ended up coming from a small crack in the bottom of the bottle. Don't know if they hit the floor, or if the stress of the milk expanding upon freezing (and I don't overfill) caused it. In general, a good idea and product, and I would probably buy it again, even with the bottle/lid cracking issues."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I take these capsules daily. They provide energy without the jitters and they keep my weight down. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these capsules!
health personal care,health care,thermometer accessories,5.0,"Item is exactly what I wanted and expected. I decided after purchasing several other Probe, Ear and Temple Thermometers and them not work properly as well as not being accurate, it was time to spend the money and use exactly what they use at the Dr.'s office. Being in the Medical Field I checked out the reviews and purchased what seemed to be the best fit."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I have found that taking Biotin makes my nails grow two times as fast even when I cut my nails they grow back very fast. I also find that taking Biotin gives my skin that extra glow and I have smoother skin since taking the supplement. I have only been taking these pills for about two weeks so its way to soon to tell if they are actually promoting hair growth or if there just placebo pills. But since hair grows 1/2 inch per month I will continue to take Biotin for six months before writing another review. Hopefully this product helps promote hair growth since that was the main reason I perchased it to begin with.
health personal care,health care,foot care,3.0,"First impression is not great. I ordered these on-line and then before they came I happened to see the Dr. Scholl's Foot Mapping machine in a store. The machine recommended Dr. Scholl's Custom Fit Orthotic Inserts CF 440 because I have low arch and very high pressure. I went ahead and bought those and started wearing them, and I love them. These were not the cheap replacement in-soles, BTW, like I've tried before from the drug store. They were more expensive than the Powersteps.Then the Powerstep Originals came in the mail. After wearing them a while both my feet were hurting, although originally it was only my right foot that was bothering me.Maybe my feet would get used to them after a while. The directions do say to wear them only a few hours a day at first. However, the Dr. Scholl's orthotic inserts provided immediate relief without any need for a break-in period."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I started using Nerve Support Formula in January 2011. It started off great with customer service. They emailed me and even telephoned me asking for feedback and making adjustments to my dosage.At the end of the first month I had been taking NINE (9) capsules a day with no improvement. Their rep kept the information flowing about the amazing number of things that could be causing the capsules not to work. At the 30 day mark I was talked into two more bottles at nearly $50 each. I was finished with all three bottles well within the 90 days and had no productive results at all from the capsules. The emails kept coming in with even more reasons why it didn't work and trying me to buy more of the useless capsules.They called me again and I explained the situation again. I told them I would buy no more capsules because they did nothing but cost me money. When I asked about their well-advertised refund I was told I was not eligible because I was way past the 30 day limit. I thought it best to control my temper, so I told the rep I sort of expected that and that I was very disappointed. I also told them I would be making my situation clear, as I am now.After that I received about 6 more email messages. I replied to a couple and I finally think the message got through that I had had it.Don't waste your money.Steve Bouton"

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Ive been on over 30 cruises and always use this, its great and doesnt make you tired like medicines. Its hard to find in drug stores, glad i can get it on amazon"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,I like this whey protein. It mixes very well with both soy milk and water. The taste is just ok because there is no sugar added so the mix is not as sweet as the ON Double Rich Chocolate. It is a nice change to switch on and off between the two so you don't get board with the taste. Great prices from Amazon but it does fluctuate alot.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Best one if you are looking for pure St John Wort Tea, all the other St John tea have other items in them hence you effects like high blood pressure get this instead it is better then a regular anti depressant and works right away"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is the best assortment of flavored oils I have been able to find online. There are good reasons to buy flavored oils prepared by a reputable manufacturer than to make your own; if not filtered properly these kinds of oils can harbor botulism (particularly if you are infusing olive oil with garlic). Each bottle is 8.5 ounces, which will leave you wanting more. This suggests that the oils are best used in vinaigrettes, as a finishing oil (on pasta, fish, meat), or some other raw application rather than in cooking, which could absorb too much for too little flavor. Oddly, in the box the shipper did not include any advertising on their products or other paperwork that would enable the buyer to order more and in greater quantities - a missed opportunity!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've only tried this product with skim milk thus far, but its taste far exceeded my expectations -- it tastes exactly like chocolate milk to me. I was concerned I wouldn't like the taste due to the artificial sweetener (which sometimes has a strange aftertaste in foods), but I honestly can't tell the difference between this and a product that uses pure sugar. An awesome way to take care of that protein deficiency in my diet."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,Works great for my daughter since she was 5 months old whether at home or out. Easy for travelling too.Highly recommended!!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Superymes is a product I love and have taken for four years it is a perfect supplement for digestion and many other common maladies of the body.I am disappointed in the fact that (Amazon) increased the product price per bottle by 50% over the past 6 months. What kind of ridiculous increase is that?
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This product has helped me with my GI problems alot. I suffer from a spasmic stomach, and therefore get a lot of gas and gastric distress at times. This product has diminished much of my distress. I would definitely recommend it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I have used approximately 20 protein drinks over the years. Most were disappointing - either too sweet, caulky, gritty, watery, or just bad tasting. This is the best I've tried. I bought the chocolate and the flavor is light, but all other characteristics of the product are very good (I use a blender so I haven't evaluated the hand mixability). Note that if you wait a little after mixing the drink thickens so when blended with milk and ice gives a milkshake consistency."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"It's very calming and smells wonderful! Only problem is, because it's a spray, the smell disappears within seconds or minutes."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,Like most people I don't always have time to cook up something tasty and healthy so I kinda' cheat by having a few of these in my desk or bag. The numbers are really good and it doesn't taste like other protein-fiber-board bars that I have had in the past. I was genuinely surprised how good the chocolate almond tasted.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I bought this in a local drugstore when it went on sale (2 for 1). At 60 years old and starting to ride my bicycle again after a long lay off, I noticed the very positive effect after only a little over one week. I consider it an essential daily supplement now."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"I got it for the health benefits, which I won't be able to experience because this taste and smells like sweet ass. One of my coworkers enjoyed it so I'll be passing both boxes to him and will just continue to eat more fruits and vegetables. If you don't mind the taste, Bael Fruit has amazing health benefits. Unfortunately, the taste of sweet ass is not to my liking."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"I like the flavor of Vita Coco more than Zico, it seems more pure tasting.The benefits of coconut water are incredible-- especially as a hangover cure. This has been one of my favorite food/drink finds of the decade. I recommend to everyone."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"For the money this is the best protein out their. Taste wise it is above average for its low calorie standard. Do not expect a rich Muscle Milk type protein because this is not that. There is a reason MM is 200 calories more per serving. This does the job though, and has a decent taste."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I purchased the manual version of this 4 years ago. At first it was very comfortable but after about 6 months the foam padding became hard, indented and a lot less comfortable. A few weeks ago the legs started to pull apart, Human Touch are terrible, they have no fix and will not sell a new base, and once your warrant has expired you are out of luck. So we are clear I am the only person that sits in this chair and I weight 175IbsI never write reviews I just felt very strongly about this inferior product and company."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"I was so excited about these sprinkles for my cupcake decorating needs... that is until i tried a cupcake that i had LIGHTLY dusted with the glitter.It feels like tiny razors in your mouth and absolutely ruins the texture of your baked goods. Go natural, dump these ""edible"" flakes."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is one of the few B12 vitamins that advertises NOT to include many common allergen substances, including Corn...which is rather rare, as corn is not yet recognized as one of the big allergens (on most food items).

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I have tried nearly all of the Coffee Masters flavored coffees, and this flavor is my favorite by leaps and bounds. It smells and tastes like a cinnamon bun with a sprinkling of walnuts on top. There are three main flavors (vanilla, cinnamon and nuts) and none overpower the other."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"First, I haven't had to use the survival equipment, and hope I never do. That said, this product could easily save your life. The most important items in the kit are the whistle, fire starter and tinder, signal mirror and the survival brochure. These alone are worth more than the whole kit if bought separately. With this kit, a pocket knife, a flashlight, a first aid kit and an emergency blanket, you'll be ready for just about anything mother nature or circumstance can dish out on land (sorry, a life raft is not included).The package is very small. I can easily fit it into the back pocket of my Levi's. It nearly fits into my shirt pocket. In a pack, you won't know it's even there. But the pouch is big enough that you won't have any problem removing the contents. Just the right size for a slightly expensive stocking stuffer.When you send your kids off into the world, make sure they have one of these in their glove box. Yours too.Happy trails!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"It seems to be a great provider of Omega 3 fatty acids. I bought it on the recommendation of my primary physician at Kaiser Permanente Panorama City, California, and a cousin of mine, a semi-retired osteopathic physician who has run a wellnessprogram in Northern California also uses it."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"I loved this oil for a few weeks, but suddenly black mold has appeared in the bottom of the glass bottle I poured it into.It is possible that the bottle was not 100% clean, but it was new and never used before. I rinsed before I used it.I will try another brand next time."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,Im addicted to this on my rice. its great on anything bland and you wont have to add salt because it adds so much flavor. the taste isnt just hot but has a great depth and the sesame seeds add texture. cant have rice without it anymore.House - Shichimi Togarashi 0.63 Oz.
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"This product has pros and cons, but the overwhelming pro is that my baby, who hates sippy cups, happily drinks very well from the mega sipper.Pros:1. baby likes it2. I've heard that a straw is better for their mouths than a sippyCons:1. lots of parts2. need to run through the dishwasher to really get it clean3. sprays when milk gets trapped in the straw and baby drops it or opens it by herself4. when the liquid gets low and baby tips it, she can't get any liquidSo, it's not perfect, but I'm very grateful for this product. We have been able to ditch the bottle thanks to the mega sipper!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"If you look at the nutrition info its only 20g of sugar per bar, but they taste really sweet. I have to have them with water always. Other than that, they are delicious!! Would recommend++++"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This oil is very potent and the price is great! I purchased this oil for it's anti-inflammatory properties, specifically for arthritis, canker sores, etc. As I stated earlier, the oil is potent and can be irritating for some. I have found that it helps to mix it with a carrier oil in some instances."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,4.0,"The popcorn arrived the same day as our new Great Northern Foundation 8 oz popcorn machine. While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket. You're having to dump the whole package, oil, salt and popcorn, into the bucket from the side, and if the oil, salt and popcorn were all in one compartment, it might be narrower and easier. That said, we found the popcorn that came out of these prepackaged packets just a little salty for our taste. In future, we'll probably make it without using the whole packet of salt. The butter-flavored salt is a great idea, just maybe a little less of it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was frightened about starting the Niacin, due to the potential for flushing, but found that I did not have a flush with this product. I take one in the morning and one at bedtime. I'll be interested to see if my total cholesterol has improved."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I used to buy this stuff at the cafe where I worked. Got very quickly addicted to it because it is just absolutely delicious. But since leaving my last job, I'd been unable to find it... Then I ran into it on Amazon and ordered a bunch... before finding it at Target the other day... Oh, well. I'm enjoying it greatly. My only gripe would be that it is so absurdly expensive. Is there a shortage of oranges or something? But clearly I'm willing to pay the price - nothing else tastes like this. Makes great iced tea as well."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"For the price you really can't beat this. I've had better jasmine pearls, but they were much more expensive. I'm pleased with this product and it's price enough to continue wanting to purchase more."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,cereal,5.0,This the best flavor out of all the others my daugther loves it and it is easy to make and very nutritional too.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We used these for my daughter when she was an infant, as they were the only ones that she could use and keep her bottle down. They are easy to use, great when travelling (minimal cleaning) and are super cute with the designs. Tried & true design...they've been around for years!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"This is great. My Mom use to make this. I just love it. I bought about 6 lbs of Napa Chinese Cabbage, Cut it, add salt, soaked it for a few hours.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I discovered Colostrum by Symbiotics in the late 90's when it healed a stubborn sprained ankle that wasn't getting better. I've kept it on hand ever since. I have opened the capsules and sprinkled it on my pet's food (which they love) to help boost their immune systems and now take two capsules, twice per day to help keep my own immune system strong. I'll go years betweens colds... I take 4-6 capsules twice per day if I suffer a sports related injury and it heals in record time!I haven't taken over the counter allergy/cold medicine in over a decade."

Still waiting,"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"I remember enjoying campbells manhatten clam chowder when there were clams in it.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I started drinking red rooibos tea when I gave up caffeine. I especially like the Celestial Seasonings blends because the flavors are satisfying and the price is reasonable. I tried more expensive rooibos teas and found I didn't like them as well. So many of them have too-strong flavors that completely overpower the gentle rooibos experience. I drink Orange Mango Rooibos tea daily, maybe 3 or 4 cups a day. It has a harmonious blend of flavors that enhances just about anything you eat with it (especially dark chocolate) and also makes a great treat all by itself. For even more decadence, add a splash of cream. It also makes a great iced tea."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Prone to depression/anxiety I've searched far and wide for a supplement that would ease my symptoms. Things that were happening to me have seem to have lessened after using Coromega. I'd become moody and irritable,, know all about SSRI's and St Johns Wort,even the good KIRA brand.Finally I've got some hope back for a more even keel life without moodswings, not being able to sit still and focus, compulsive disorder, ect.. I'm also feeling less pain as I suffer from a nerve issue that effects my neck, shoulder, and arm.I take baths to soothe this pain and for whatever reason the heat would make my heart beat faster,, for me heat/humidity=anxiety, but just tonight i noticed this wasnt happening.I'm already seeing effects from Coromega after a few days and have great hopes that it will only get better. I hate meds and think this may be a real great find.. Buy this product.."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I usually get my Beanpod Eucalyptus Lavender at a local flower/gift shop, but they don't carry this scent lately, so I ordered through Amazon via Soy Basics. It turned out to be great. It was the newer style jars and the scent was the same as ever. I'm back to buy one or two more. I like to burn this scent after dinner, to get the food smells out of the house for bedtime. Burns clean. I've seen other types of candles leave a film on cabinets or counter tops, these don't. It is smokey when I blow it out, I just set on the stove top and turn on the vent if I feel like messing with getting the smoke out. So glad I found my brand and fragrance."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,Many different plants/trees give me a skin rash if they touch me. When I use Ivy Block - no rash. It is not oily so it isn't uncomfortable in the heat.
health personal care,health care,stimulants,5.0,I actually bought this by mistake and was going to send it back the minute it came. I researched it online and found it worked well for mental alertness and hormonal balance. I kept it and tried it and it did seem to help with both. I usually take over th ecounter herbal type hormone balance products. This seemed to work as well as those for now. Sometimes I have to change products for awhile because I seem to build up a resistence.
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"I was having pain in my knee and turns out I had Runner's Knee. I bought these to help relieve the pain and I've been using them for a little over a month and my knee pain has definitely improved. I still have a little after I run, but these things have helped. I'm also doing Terminal Extension exercies to help strenghten the muscles around my knees. To help them last longer, I keep them in my running sneakers and only where them to run.Also, my Reebok sneakers are a size 7 and I got the 6-6.5 size and they fit in my sneakers perfectly. However, they don't fit in my size 7 New Balances."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"we've been using this product for a few years now. Very important to start taking tablets at first sign of cold or flu (scratchy sorethroat for me). also family members (your livein friends et al) should begin taking them at same time to avoid being infected. Also,continue to take tablets for a couple days after you feel better. We keep a supply on hand year round."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This product has only 28mg of sodium from the condroitin. I wanted a low sodium product. I carry the capsules in my pocket in a pill box and it holds up excellently, even in the hottest weather. It has no after-affects on me whatsoever.I have been on this type of supplement for a number of years now, so I have relegated my dosage to maintenance levels. This is normally half dosage, in this case two capsules per day instead of four. I have found out that the quality of this product permits me to take only one capsule per day. With my previous product, I could not do this, so in the long run I was spending more then.With four capsules per day, this product provides more latitude for fine tuning dosages than some products that have only two capsules per day. For me, it works just fine. For someone who needs all four capsules per day, it may cost more per day, but you may need only three. For cost reasons, I down-rated it by one star."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,My son threw the cup and it broke immediately. The other lasted longer but quickly bit the dust after more rough play. Plastic needs to be stronger.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"Lipton Diet Raspberry Iced Tea Mix is my favorite, but it's very hard to find in stores. The supermarkets don't generally carry it, and if I'm lucky I can find a few jars at Walmart, but not recently.I did a Google search on the product, and found it on Amazon! Such a reliable site and company. The tea mix has a wonderfully not-too-sweet flavor,and mixes well."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I bought this item based on the good reviews, but it isn't working for me. No difference.I bought for a bunion, and it doesn't stop any pain."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,i bought this watch with the hopes that the maker of this item was making valid claims. 2nd month using this watch with a back up of the clear blue easy digital ovulation strips( the circle/ happy face ones)i had a lh surge before the watch even said i was on my fertile day 1. i have reg 28 day cycles. it looks like all this watch does is calculate an average based on your cycle length. so the expensive sensors are a waste of money if they don't actually read what they are suppose to do.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,Regular sodium is a problem when eating or cooking. Sea salt does not remain in the body like common table salt.I have used Sea Salt for years and would not change back for anything. Doc much happier also.

I was 107Lbs 1 month ago,now Im at 124 Lbs. It was very hard for me to gain weight,since Im very active and have a high motabolism. This weight gainer has put some pounds on my skinny butt,and my wife loves the love handles."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"These are harder/crunchier than other pretzels, & lower in salt. That's why we like them so much. My son - who has severe food allergies - can eat these without any problems. They make a great addition to his school lunches.Enjoy!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"This purchase was a gift for someone else. Because of the high price I shopped everywhere.

baby products,feeding,unknown,3.0,"Best to buy this in your current weight range and not pre-preg size! I'm a pants size 6/8 that would make me a Small but the Smalls don't fit me, the Medium is just about right, in my 3rd trimester I am weighing over 180 lbs. While this belt gives excellent support it is best used if you're standing or walking for long periods of time for work or shopping perhaps. If you're going to be seated for long periods it won't do justice as it digs into flesh either at the edges or fold over and compress your belly at the fold which can be very painful especially if you had a c-section before. If you're gonna be seated for long periods, or lying down, may I suggest the Medela Maternity Support because it's softer and more breathable. I just wished this belt came in skintone friendly colors as white sticks out like a sore thumb if I don't tuck it in my pants properly."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,hot cocoa,4.0,"The last time I bought this product on Amazon I paid more than twice as much as I did this time.I would like to know why the large disparity in price. It is a good product, if we get a steady supply at a good price."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,These beans are so good that it's hard to buy them very often because they sell out so quickly. The box of 4 large bags from Bob's Red Mill; especially with Amazon's free supersaver shipping; is worth every penny.

My foot doc. thought they were fine, but felt I needed more suport.(Think he just wanted to make some bucks) He had a pair made for me I use them in my primary work shoes, but most women have more than one pair of shoes, so I purchase these for my other shoes instead of switching out all the time.Give them a try, I think they are great!"

It came right on time (after two days), and well-packaged! Luna bars are a great breakfast bar (if you can't stomach much in the morning), or post-workout bar. Peppermint stick is definitely one of the best flavors!! Thanks!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After receiving anesthesia twice in one month, I was tired, weak and mentally dull - even my hair was flat and dull. I told my holistic health care lady about my problem and she recommended this product along with Daily Detox Tea. After suffering for weeks, within 12 hours, I felt back to my energetic and happy self. Now, I keep it on hand in case I get a build up of toxins and feel down."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"These seemed to work well. I started with the ovulation testing on day 10 and by day 13, I found there to be 2 distinct lines!It only took me once, and I am pregnant now, so I was able to use the pregnancy testing strips. On day 26, I tested and found there to be the faintest line. I will say that the lines do not show up as prominent as the ovulation test strips that I was using, however, it did show up.Very pleased and would encourage anyone that wants to get pregnant or even avoid being pregnant (birth control) that these are a great product for a wonderful price!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"It's what I drink immediately after working out, following the ""Golden Hour"" rule (have a carb/protein snack within 1 hr. after heavy workout, helps with recovery, building muscle, metabolism...).

grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk substitutes,5.0,"Eden Foods is quite possibly the world's greatest food company. If you read their history of organic and natural foods you'll be amazed, pleased, and inspired by the efforts they take to make sure their products are the very best. I can't say enough good things about this company. The founder is one of the key leaders in the organic food world and take initiatives that no-one else would ever take to make sure that you (and I) are getting the very best food in the world. No exaggeration. They were the first to go BPA-free, USA organic soybean, non-GMO certified, etc. Eden Soy is the main Eden product and it is wonderful. Rich, smooth, and nutritious. Once you open it... it spoils in 3-5 days. Why? Because it's real food! Even bacteria know what's good! Love Eden Soy and absolutely love Eden Foods!"

health personal care,health care,women s health,1.0,"Although some people found this cream to work wonders, it didn't work for me. I started out with Emerita brand and it changed my life, I had more energy, slept better, had better memory, all sorts of things. I had purchased that at a health food store. I saw the Source Naturals on Amazon at a much better price and decided to try it. I do like that it's in a pot and it does have a nice smell but ever since I switched I've been feeling worse and worse. I don't know if it's the quality of ingredients or if it's the fact that Emerita comes from yam and Source Naturals comes from soy, or if there's another reason I haven't even guessed at. Everyone is different so if one cream doesn't work, try another. Going back to Emerita!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,Like the taste. I have not gotten sick of it yet. I switch between the Choc and Vanilla.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I first encountered this rub when applied by the gentlemen at Bisher's Quality Meats in Ramona, CA.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I used this product to turn white icing into a nice dark green color for an Alligator cake. I put most of the bottle into the icing and you couldn't even taste it. Several people asked how I was able to get such a great dark green!
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"i purchased this product when i started tracking my ovulation. its very accurate! it beeps to tell you its workin & beeps quicker when its done. its not a loud annoying beeps as some people have claimed. it lights up in the beginning but not right at the end when it finds your temp, but thats ok cuz it stores your temp results on it for future review. its a good price and great quality. i would def buy this product again :)"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I had a frozen embryo transfer last Friday after a failed IVF cycle in March, and I got a faint line on a cheap pregnancy test, so I went out and bought these digitals fully expecting to get ""Not Pregnant"" today. The box clearly states that it's something like 41% accurate 5 days before your period, 50% 4 days before, 70% 3 days before, 90% two days before, and 95% the day before your period. My bloodwork wasn't even scheduled until Monday, so imagine my shock when I saw ""Pregnant"" come back in less than a minutes time!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,There is absolutely nothing wrong with the bulbs however I ordered the wrong ones..My unit that I bought at the same time uses two 40 watt bulbs instead of this bulb that is eighty watts. In the illustration showing the 80 watt flowtron bug zapper there seemed to be only one bulb in the unit and the description of the unit made no mention that it used 2 40 watts.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,THYROMINE HEALTH SUPPLEMENT & WEIGHT LOSS PILL FOR PEOPLE WITH UNDERACTIVE THYROIDSIt looks a good deal. The price seems about average.I urgently need to renew my supply.But there is no way I am going to purchase a product when the advertising quite deliberately avoids telling me how many tabs are in each tub !!! C'mon... do you think we are all stupid !!!!I want to know the dose/supply I am purchasing for my 'bargain' price.There may only be enough tabs for 1 week in the tub.. and then the buyer is the sucker.Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves for letting this one through !!!.. and the company producing them needs a kick up the a..e !!..................................................................................
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I got these for one particular cookie recipe. Previously, I was buying a package of Andes mints, and chopping all of them into little pieces. I realized later that my previous method would probably have cost less than having these baking chips mailed to my house. Far more convenient, but they are $4.50 a pack."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk substitutes,5.0,"I use this product to make Almond Milk and Sunflower Milk. I am so happy because prior to this, I was peeling each almond individually. With this product, I don't have to peel them.The reason that I didn't get this product sooner, was because I thought it heated up the milk (which it does for the soy milk and other things)...but for making Almond and Sunflower milk, no heating agent is used!! I was thrilled to be able to make milk in 1/3 of the usual time.Another task that would delay me when making the milk was the straining process. But the way the milk is made with the Soyabella, it is already strained!!Overall, I couldn't be happier."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,These crackers are quite tasty but I just noticed that they contain MSG. I feel a strange munching on huge quantities when I know they contain this unhealthy chemical. I'm now looking for a spicy Asian cracker that tastes similar but doesn't contain MSG.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This superfood was the only thing that has stopped my persistent eye twitching.Highly recommended; I take this daily, as I do red marine algae.I don't remember the last time I was sick.Try it!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,"Love the product, but it came in a container that read ""...part of a multipack; not to be sold separetely,"" and the inside seal didn't seem sealed when I opened the lid (came off very easily, when I opened for the first time). But product is apparently perfectly fine. Dangerously delicious :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've been using TwinLab Daily One capsules for about 10 months. I have borderline anemia so I switched to the Daily One with Iron and my recent blood work came back with my iron levels in the normal range. I don't always take them with a meal, but they have not caused any stomach upset or burping like solid pill-type vitamins do to me."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"i'm totally disappointed when I get it this morning. first of all, the bottle is not sealed. second, it seems like they just poured some kind of oil in the bottle because since it is not sealed, there is no way for me to know whether it is really grapeseed oil or just some kind of cheap oil. they just hand-wrote the word "" cucumber"" & ""16 oz"". I will not recommend anyone to get this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The way I talk about Quercetin, you would think I'm on Source Natural's payroll. I've given handfuls of this away to friends and many of them have gone on to buying their own. I take it daily as an antioxidant;(two in the morning), then if I get the sniffles or any allergy symptoms I take another dose as an antihistamine. Finally, if my back or other joints are hurting, I take it for inflammation. I'm pretty careful to stick within the 6 caplet max suggested on the bottle but there have been times when I've gone over. One benefit I find is that when I take it for allergy symptoms, the anti-inflammatory properties soothe the tissues of my sinuses and calm down the stuffiness as well as the headache I sometimes get from the sinus thing. Within a week of this being suggested by my doctor, I was able to stop using Claratin completely. It's nice to know that something so natural (it's made from the skins of red apples and red onions) can work so well with none of the side effects or drug interactions from the normal drugs (sleepiness and worse). And I'm delighted that I can get it on auto-delivery from Amazon with free shipping. I don't usually give 5 stars but this is one of the best things I've ordered from Amazon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,Just as expected. Make sure to keep it dry before you mix it or it will tend to clump. Better to put it into the water vs. other way around. And make sure that you very carefully wash out the bottom and top of the bottle you are using. It can leave a residue. My son uses 3/4 of the recco'd amount to make it easier to drink. Says it really helps stay properly hydrated much better than the regular gatorade. It is wonderful that I can order this heavy stuff and still get a good price. thanks
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Straight up, you're probably not getting enough minerals. Multi vitamins don't count. If you're eating super clean paleo like a rockstar, and you work out, you need to replenish those babies. These tubes are awesome. I pop one in a nalgene and I'm good to go. 32oz of FRESH."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,5.0,I grew up in Africa where you could pick guavas right off a tree while you were on vacation. Well that is where I first tasted guavas. My dad boiled them in a sugar syrup and we served them with custard. The Koo guavas have been a favorite since I moved back to the States. I keep buying this brand and love the flavor. While these are not as delicious as fresh quavas they are a close second.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"Let me tell you about this stuff! All L-Carnitine is not created equal!I started taking L-Carnitine a couple of years ago because I don't eat meat; the L-Carnitine product I got at Walgreen's didn't do a thing; the Whole Foods Market brand worked well-- but I had read that the Optimum was one of the best, so I gave it a try.I took the Optimum for two months and I felt great; but little did I know just how great, until I ran out of it for a couple of days... It was like running into a brick wall; my energy level plummeted without it!500 mg of anything else is NOT like 500 mg of the Optimum Nutrition L-Carnitine! I've been in a weight loss; muscle building mode for awhile already; and I've been extremely successful. I am convinced this product enhances the body's ability to turn fat into energy."

health personal care,health care,women s health,3.0,"Let me start at the beginning.I bought this product earlier today, and as soon as I got home at about 1:30pm, I went and used it right away... Then i decided AFTER I used it, to get on and read reviews....I WAS HORRIFIED at what i read.All the negative reviews, pretty much 9.5 out of 10 people had a bad reaction to this product.Within a half an hour, i was experiencing the horrible burning and itching everyone had written about. It was almost unbearable! I wanted to cry, all i did was walk around, wiggle and sit on the edge of a hard chair!This lasted about 2 hours!Then after that, and since then I haven't had any itching or burning what so ever. It already feels better. It is now 8:30pm. I hope that the worst is over.If you are able to tolerate torture for a few hours (i think depending on different peoples bodies it may vary) then this is a good product if you don't want the hassle of the 7 day treatment. BUT if you don't think you can handle it, then be safe and go with the other treatments!My suggestion is that if you do get this product, watch a movie or something that will help take your mind off the uncomfortableness.That's all the review I have, but I hope it helps someone. I know that if I had read these reviews before I just went and did it, it would have helped me immensely."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,jerky dried meats,1.0,"* This is a review for the 1.25oz Kickin' Teriyaki flavor Beef Jerky *Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods. I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything ""kickin"" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain ""added"" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Performance power bars are a great snack between meals. I eat them when I don't want to pig out, because in this world, being fat is considered bad, and for good reason. Rather than eating more than my fair share, I skip desserts and go for a power bar instead. Obesity is a serious health problem that too many people don't take seriously enough, they don't have the will power to resist their hunger cravings. Performance power bar offers another tool in the fight against unsightly obesity, not to mention the serious health risks, joint and feet problem that being too fat brings. I use the power bars as a way to control my weight so I don't get too heavy. I take responsibility for my own diet, and I need snacks like these to keep those hunger cravings at bay. They are a little harder than I would like, but still they do the job. The protein takes away the sugar cravings, which are a death knell to any diet and well being. I look forward to trying the other flavors and formulas."

I did not experience as much acid backfiring on stomach as some other brands, probably due to sago palmformula. Still, it's acidic and everyone is different, i still feel they are a bit milder than others.(#! reason hay fever allergies happen imo is milk! -- if you drink it religiously)And as always with most vitamins, best taken after meal--even a bit of juice works well."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"I ordered the fruit punch and the lemonade. I was attracted to them because they have 5 calories and use Splenda instead of Aspartame, which seems to cause me joint pain (a by product of a misspent youth). The instructions say to use a 16.9 oz bottle of water, which works very well for the fruit punch. For the lemonade, I found it a little strong and use a 20 oz bottle with 18 - 19 oz of water in it. I used to drink 2 - 4 sodas a day, a mix of regular and diet. With this stuff, I feel better and I am saving a bunch of calories from both the soda and from not feeling as hungry because I am drinking more water (albeit flavored water). I have several friends deployed over to the sandbox and, while Army water is purified, it suffers in taste. These are a huge hit over there. They seem to be as favored, or more so, as Crystal Light. Best of all, they cost less."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I was looking for a meal replacement that was full of potent nutrients and after extensive research I settled on this product. It turns out that this one is pretty much the best out there. It's just like they say, no gimmicks. I had a problem at first with the taste because I didn't follow the instructions word for word and was missing the banana in my smoothies. I wanted to give up on it because it tasted so horrible I could almost vomit. For those having issues with the taste, make sure you read the instructions verbatim and prepare the smoothie accordingly. I didn't have any bananas at the time and tried many different combinations of fruit and they all tasted nasty. I finally prepared it exactly like the instructions said and it actually tasted pretty good. The banana is absolutely necessary in balancing the flavor. It sounds a little hard believe but trust me... I was proven wrong. This product has been through 19 revisions so they really know what they're talking about. I've had The Ultimate Meal for two weeks now and I feel great."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have been taking this product for about three weeks now on the advice of my maid of honor after I said I wanted to grow my hair longer for my fall wedding and keep it healthy in the process. She started taking these last fall and said her hair and nails started to grow like crazy. Three weeks in and my hair is just about an inch longer and looks and feels healthier. My skin also looks a lot better and my moderate acne has healed considerably. I like that it is high in folic acid and doesn't bother my stomach if taken with a meal.I only have two problems with this vitamin. 1. The size of the pill and 2. The amount of calcium it contains. I take an additional calcium supplement but even if I break the pill in half, I still have a hard time swallowing it. Multi-vitamins usually have a horrible taste and this is no different. But I'm willing to gag once a day for it's benefits."

This pump was given as a gift at my Shower, and I only have to use it about once a week when I'm really full and baby is sleeping (or she's already full off other breast). As time has gone by (my daughter is 3 months now) the pump seems to have lost some of it's suction power. I pump for 10 minutes...and end up with sore nipples, still full boobs and maybe an ounce of fore milk. I can hand express my milk better than this pump can get it out.I also don't like how LOUD this pump is. I have to pump in the bathroom under the stairs or else I might wake the neighborhood!I wish I could go back in time and take this item off my registry and replace it with a single manual pump. I feel bad so much money was spent on a product that just barely works."

But ever since I've been taking these (about a year), I haven't had a single cold sore. I take (2) every day and if I start to feel sick at all I'll take (3) to help my immune system. My boyfriend gets cold sores too so I turned him onto these and he still gets them, but not as frequently and they don't last nearly as long as they used to. Definately recommend this!! If you are a frequent sufferer of cold sores, I swear these will change your life! :)"

I wanted something natural but this thing is useless. So instead of helping me I think these pills were the cause of my insomnia, would never try them again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This Vitamin and ALL it's numerous similar but very different cousins by the same OR very similar names is most confusing to buy. The Ads look like the bottles are the same but when trying to sort through the actual content of the vitamins and minerals in the product itself I discovered that each type IS NOT THE SAME ONE BOTTLE TO THE NEXT. If your Opthalmologist or other eye care professional has recommended a particular brand or type within that brand be sure you really know which one is being recommended and the percent of each of the medications within the tablet that is being recommended. If you have trouble swallowing capsules or tablets be sure you know which one you are buying. After almost two weeks of research I found this tablet was exactly what my Doctor had recommended. Be careful to not buy the overly high content products and then take those with you regular daily supplement of a mulitple vitamins or you may be actually overdosing on SOME of the items in these mulitple vitamin/mineral products which can be dangerous or even defeat the purpose of taking the supplement in the first place. ALL medications are dangerous if taken in too high a dose. Vitamins and minerals also can and do interact with some prescriptions medications so it is important to take only the amount recommended. Also generic items are not necessarily the same as this brand name so again read the lables of each and be sure they are exactly alike before buying.Overall I am very pleased with this product and will buy it again.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"I bought this for my toddler to use on his pillow in case there were night time accidents. The material made a lot of noise which he didn't like. Also, it made him get really hot/sweaty. It does not zip closed, it overlaps but this does not work very well. The pillowcase ends up to be only MOSTLY waterproof. I bought a zip close terrycloth cover to replace it and I'm very happy with that."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I have both My Brest Friend and a Boppy. I love them both for different reasons. I use My Brest Friend mainly at night and in bed. I usually leave the Boppy in the living room and the Brest Friend in the bedroom. The Boppy kept sliding out from under my son while feeding him in bed during the night. The Brest Friend stays in place and I love how I can keep a bottle of Lanolin and a burp cloth in the little pocket attached to it for easy reach. I also think the cradle and cross-cradle holds are easier with the Brest Friend and I love the deluxe's cover, it is so soft.For visiting family, I prefer the Boppy because it is a bit smaller and easier to travel with. The Brest Friend is just a little large and cumbersome for taking out. I also think the football hold is easier with the Boppy on the couch then the Brest Friend. When trying the football with the Brest Friend, you have to turn it to the side which moves the back support to your side, kinda defeating the purpose of having it there in the first place.I really do love them both though."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I bought a tube of Penetran probably 15 years ago and was amazed at how well it worked on my severe arthritis. After all, it had cost me $10 for 4 ounces, so it should work. All through the years, whenever I used it, I found amazing relief, so I was dismayed when it ran out. Fortunately, I found it on Amazon, now $12 for 2 ounces (a good price considering inflation), and it really, really does work!"

I do like spicy madras style. But when it comes to my child, the little one consistently turns her nose up to curry. This, no. I have made it 3 times. I do not use microwave. When I added stir fry veggies it was okay nice not great but acceptable. She liked it and I turned the heat up for me with some Tony Casheries( A creole/cajun spice blend) . However when I added cooked meat rotisserie chicken or honey marinated chicken kabob pieces it was wonderful. I think accompanied with a salad- a complete meal for two w/o excessive calories but a satisfying portion. I love the burn but her system does not and it opens his palate to an array of flavors. The one with raisins is excellent too. I tried the low sodium one.. It definitely needed some red octane but my child was good to go.Would I take a Marsala Dosa and spicy sambar over this yes( In a red hot minute!) but to put together a quick meal out of the cabinet;this is my new favorite flavorful staple."

I must try them in cooking
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,Not sure about this one. There is some body of evidence that it is a killer anti oxidant. It is pretty expensive for the little you get and cannot really couch for noticeable changes in any blood work as a result. After two months I opted out of adding this to my vitamin regime.

This liquid carnitine is the highest dose per tablespoon (3g) that I've been able to find. Has a punch of an orange glycerine flavor, but I chase it down with a sip of water. When I take this I feel the difference in energy it gives to my muscles, especially when I climb up the subway steps on the morning commute when I am exhausted. I keep a bottle at home & a bottle at work. Fuels the mitochondria of heart & muscle cells. Take on empty stomach. I love the flip-nozzle top for easy dispensing either into a spoon or directly into the mouth."

I read the directions over and over and I was beginning to think the other reviewers were right, that there was no Farenheit setting. I had been holding the button down waiting for the ""C"" to start flashing, released the button and then when I pushed the button again it would just turn off. The last try (before I was going to send it back) I pushed the button down, and releaed it as soon as the little ""M"" underneath the ""C"" disappeared, then pushed the button a second time and it changed to ""F"". Nowhere in the directions does it say anything about that. My husband probably thought I was crazy because I almost jumped for joy!! So bottom line, the thermometer is super fast, accurate but the directions are unclear."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I love most PowerBars. I always take a couple in my pack when biking or hiking, and I also keep a couple in my briefcase for when I miss meals at work. Most PowerBar flavors are excellent.Years ago, PowerBar used to make a ""Triple Threat"" chocolate caramel fusion bar that was very tasty. This new formulation, though, tastes pretty bad. It has a very artificial, vitaminish flavor. Having said that, tastes are subjective, so you may like the flavor. Given my experience, though, I'd suggest that you buy one of these in a store and try it before purchasing a whole box of them from Amazon.If you're looking for chocolate flavored PowerBars, I'd recommend either their traditional chocolate bar (tasty, but also very sticky) or the PowerBar Harvest Whole Grain Energy Bar (very tasty, and neater)."

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,1.0,"I found this device very distracting. You have to watch the lights to see if you are in the ""zone."" If you have meditated in the past you may find this thing to be a time waster and take you away from reducing your stress. This unit really comes down to a breath pacer.Here is what the company recommends1. Breath in with the lights and pretend you are breathing in through your heart.2. Think of something that makes you feel love or compassion.3. Breath out.See if you can keep the breath pace the same and your pulse low, and make the light turn green.Geez... here is how you can do it without the box.1. Breath in for a count of 5...1,2,3,4,5..2. Think of good things...3. Breath out for a count of 5...1,2,3,4,54. Save over $100, and that in itself will reduce your stress.I sold my unit on eBay, bought it there too so bought it cheap, sold it for the same."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I have chronic back problems like many other reviewers here. I have also been a chiropractic patient for decades. In the past several months my adjustments have not been holding very long and it has been frustrating, not to mention painful and worrisome. I saw this and it seemed worth a try. Surprisingly, after only a week, I have seen positive results.Let me first say that it is not something that is comfortable. If you cannot tolerate some pain, you might not be able to use this. Still, if you are willing, it will toughen you up! I suppose, however, that those who have suffered with chronic back pain, or those very familiar with chiropractic care (as others have said), who really know the benefits of relief, seem like the best ones to decide if laying on something like this is worth it. It is for me, but I am sure that this product is not for everyone.I received relief the first time I used it. Being a skeptic about things like this, I was very surprised. I began with the recommended 5 minutes and followed the other instructions. Since then, I have been using this 3-4 times a day for short bursts and I have found much comfort as a result.My biggest problem has been my sacrum L5-S1 and the subsequent shifting of my pelvis. This then was reflected in pulling muscles in the right side of the back of my neck. So far I have seen a remarkable improvement in all of this. Back pain has decreased considerably; the sacrum has become more stable. If it goes out, it is not as severe as before. Using the Spine-Worx can quickly realign things. I had been using chiropractic pelvic blocks for this, but this seems to be more effective. The overall result is that my neck, as well, has been enjoying some painless days. Headaches associated with the neck muscles have subsided and almost completely have disappeared. The rest of my spine also feels great. I suppose that is because each time I lay on this thing, I can feel a number of vertebrae being realigned.It takes time! There must be a willingness to spend whatever time necessary to make this work. It just might do the trick for you. However, you must be the deciding factor!"

It doesn't taste bad and there is no lingering after-taste."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"It's a great product (I've had this in Natural before and it was perfect), though the vanilla flavoring is a tad too sweet. That's really my only complaint, actually - some days the sweetness doesn't bother me at all, other days it's cloying. There's no chemical aftertaste and I still swear by Biochem because of this."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I was a little upset when they arrived to find they were 1/2 the amount of the packets I was purchasing but have found they are as sweet in smaller amounts as the larger packets. Nu Stevia is the ONLY Stevia for me!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I bought a container of this product a few weeks back as a way to bulk up my protein shakes and get extra fiber into my diet. Since then, I've also been using it with oatmeal. I will warn you though"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"A friend told me about this and I was skeptical but ordered it anyway because my 4 yr old has eczema and I was desperate. It worked wonders, and my daughter said ""Mommy, it doesn't hurt like the medicine the doctor gives me!""."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"this has an excellent flavor (chocolate) and excellent ingredients, which is really the primary factors for me. i give it 4 stars because its pretty thick. i use a shaker bottle with a wire whisk ball and it still doesn't break up all the chunks. they are small, but still there...no matter how long i shake it up. so i tried a blender, which was a big mistake. the volume of liquid doubled. a half blender turned into a full blender, with no cup in the house nearly large enough to hold that concoction. took me about a half hour or more to drink a very large amount of thick, air entrained liquid. stick with a shaker bottle, it's much better. and the little chunks go down easy, as they break up well in the mouth and are still yummy in their own right. if you like the consistency of a mcdonalds milk shake, you'll like this stuff. but i have 2 other types that shake up smooth as silk, and they are awesome. they aren't meal replacements, but they are both high quality protein drinks. one of them is the french vanilla creme optimum nutrition 100% whey gold standard. absolutely incredible stuff. so in comparing the thin vs. thick, i really love the thin, and really like the thick. perhaps the whey gold meal is thicker because its a meal replacement, and also is not made with instantized whey protein. all in all, a very good product with excellent flavor."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have not purchased this product from Amazon however I will from now on. I initially heard about the Konjac Fiber as like most...from the media. I called our local Whole Foods Supermarket and they had it. I purchased it and I can only say that since I have been taking this supplement, I oddly have not been experiencing any migraines, no back pain and it has greatly curbs my appetite. Most of what I eat and drink is absorbed. I don't have cravings and I have energy. I do take other vitamin supplements so I can't say that this is the magical remedy to my feeling good but I can say that when I was taking my other vitamins without this fiber supplement I didn't have the same effect. I have been talking about this product to all of my friends and they have also gone out and purchased it and have been having the same effect so I would recommend that people try it!"
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"You place your pill in and turn. Want it a little more ""fine""? Just turn slightly counter-clockwise, shake up and down a few times and turn clockwise again. It's very simple and I'm trying to figure out why I chose to struggle with a hammer for so long. I take a lot of Nootropics for study, and wanted to negate the time-release of some of them (which requires a simple break of the pill), but also wanted to make them easier to ingest since taking pills orally can be a bit difficult for me sometimes; and this works perfectly for that. I received it in a small, clear bag with a barcoded label, which I appreciated. Not a fan of paying for packaging. The reviewing community came through for me again. Great purchase. Highly recommended."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Of all the protein shakes out there, this one actually tastes good! I use milk instead of water. You can use a blender to mix it, but if you have a good arm simply shaking or stirring it works just as well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I got this product after my doctor recommended that I use this supplement to support my weightloss efforts. It isn't a miracle drug, but I do think that it is helping. It's important to note that in order to get the amount of CLA that was used in the 2007 meta analysis which showed statistically significant weight loss (3.2 g/day) you have to take more than the bottle indicates. The directions suggest 2 to 3 softgels over the course of the day- but each softgel only has 780 mg of CLA. I take 4 per day, which is technically still short at just 3.12g/day but I eat eggs most days and they are a food source for CLA. Hope this information helps someone!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"So far my baby has no trouble going back and forth from the drop ins with this latex nipple and the breast, which is all I can ask for. He does seem to be able to chug the 3-4 oz from this nipple extremely fast but he isn't choking or spilling all over the place, so I think the slow flow must be good enough for him."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"The height of the second row/shelf is adjustable, which is nice (although adjusting the level once it's set can be difficult). As other reviews have mentioned, it feels a bit flimsy, but I've had no problems with it being completely full of plastic bottles and parts. The only negative (which isn't really a negative) is that I wish it had a third row to hold more items. I definitely recommend this product for anyone with limited counter space."
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"I've had to use expensive perscription type arch supports for a number of years. Over time they have worn out, though the arch support remaines firm. I tried on a pair of these Soles off the shelf when away from home and found the arch support substantial compared to the usually rather whimpy inserts I've seen local retail stores. Made the purchase and they did not collapse or wear out. Since then, I've been looking for a retail source. When I saw them on Amazon, I immediately made another purchase. I will buy more. The price point is fine - you get what you pay for."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is my favorite vitamin c.Very tasty, so i can enjoy it, which is very important for me. I usually do not like to have vitamins and often have to thraw them away because they are expired. But this one... i buy for myself and for others as a gift. I recomend it to my family and friends."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,The other reviews are classic examples of how taste varies. This is the same sauce that is used at Popeye's restaurants in the little packets. I love it. My wife loves it. My friends love it. It's good. It's not that hot really if you like hot sauces but the flavor is excellent.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,Love this stuff though I've been told its best to use as part of a cycle and to cycle it in your routine every other month or so. I love spinning class but it's tough as I go to spinning class 3x a week and still work out in the weight room. So I tend to also work out legs 1 to 2 times a week and it has been really tough to do this. The No-Xplode gave me the energy and strength I've needed to power through both workouts without slacking in spinning class or deciding to take days off from weight training. Big fan!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I used this religiously for three weeks and didn't see any improvement in my milk supply. It was dwindling badly and I was trying to pump for my daughter until she was a year old. But even though I used Goat's Rue along with Breastea, I saw no improvement. A very expensive effort, but not a useful one."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Was disappointed that when I received the package as the box was obviously damaged, quite squashed. When I opened it the red food gel had leaked through the box. It hadn't all leaked out thankfully, but had made quite a mess. But as for the actual product, I am quite happy with it and think it was great value for money opposed to buying it in Australia where I would have had to pay almost the same P & H to get it sent 500 km's as I did to get it sent from the US, let alone the actual product price."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"This is a great product. However, the subscription process on Amazon leaves some to be desired.I love the concept and am trying it once again even after saying ""Never again"" over trying toget the subscription for this product cancelled. ... for months... and then getting a forcedpurchase - delivery that I found out about by seeing the charge show up in my online bankstatement and a few days later on my door step. Automated shopping is supposed to be EASIER.Having to repeatedly address this sort of snafu is what sends many shoppers back to thebricks/mortar stores."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The claim is ""best tasting protein shake"", and it is true! Tried it with water, and it was a little hard to drink, but mixed it with a low-cal orange juice and it tastes incredible! This was my first experience with a protein shake and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the tropical dreamsicle and also another brand in lemonade flavor. I finished the dreamsicle first and then tried the other brand. After one sip of the other stuff, I went immediately to the computer and placed an order for more Jay Robb dreamsicle and can't wait for it to get here! It's more expensive but the taste makes it worth it! I'm hooked! The worst part of it is that I have to suffer through a whole 2 pounds of the other nasty stuff-it's too expensive to throw out! I'll have to look longingly at the Jay Robb container until the other stuff is gone! Ugh!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I like this vitamin bc it has good energy and i just looove vitamins anyways. I used to take vitamin C for my energy but i got up to 4000 miligrams a day and started wrecking my stomach since i wasnt eating carbs to soak it up. This vitamin made me instantly feel like ill throw up but i hold it down for exactly 2 mins and it passes. i dont hav any side effects the rest of the day. im only 19 but i would think if it was bad on your stamach it would effect me harder since i now hav a weak stomach. however i think it is the coating around it tht pisses off ur esophogus bc pills/vitamins can NOT effect u instantly like tht. Ill be taking it until i actually vomit then ill probably get turned off on them but for now its better than Acai Berry diet pills, vita C, and laxatives.Ps. if ur stomach is upset take Tagament. its a miracle worker."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I have not seen or felt any thing different since I started this supplement. I watched the Dr. Oz show regarding this products and that is why I purchased it. Wasting money on supplements for better health can sometimes really be a waste of money. Basically, eating correctly and a little exercise would probably accomplish more. In these tough economic time (financially) be very careful how you spend your money. Walking is free and much more enjoyable."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"My doctor advised me to purchase the standardized Chamomile capsules by Nature's Way as part of his treatment plan for my anxiety. I admit that I was surprised to find a ""western MD"" so informed about the properties of herbs. He explained how, in my case, the Chamomile would work with and actually enhance the effectiveness of my prescription medication. I was also instructed that I could not just buy any chamomile I found on a store shelf. It was important that the product be ""standardized"" - meaning that the dosage/purity wouldn't vary from capsule to capsule - and that it be made as if a pharmaceutical product.Nature's Way's Chamomile, Standardized, turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. On a performance level, I can honestly tell you that, after using the product as my doctored ordered for 12 weeks, I am finding the calm within the storm that has become my life. I take 1 pill in the morning and another at bedtime in conjunction with additional elements of his treatment plan - both pharmaceutical and therapeutic.If you have a serious anxiety problem, Chamomile alone will not help. However, if you are stressed at work, pulling your hair out dealing with the kids, taking care of an elderly relative or are anxious/stressed for millions more reasons than I can list, give the Chamomile a try. It really may help..."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,This thing is great. We'd been using a dishwasher basket made for bottles and it took up so much room. This little item clips right on the front and allows for space underneath it. It works with the valves perfectly and takes up so much less space. I wish we'd known about this with our first child.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"I ordered this tubing through Amazon, sold by SCS collectibles (also made by Aerobile per packaging). It is not in Medela packaging but a clear bag (see picture of product from Aerobile). I have not even opened it, but I can read the instructions through the bag that specifically say ""DO NOT clean the tubing using steam or boiling water. Washable with cold water."" I realize that the tubing is not supposed to be in contact with the milk, but I would feel much better if I could sterilize it as the Medela instructions say. Not sure exactly what material this tubing is made of, it looks like the regular tubes that come with the pump. I'm going to return them anyhow and pay the extra couple of bucks for the ones from Medela!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"Ok, so first of all, Im always a sucker to try out new diet pills, though I am not overweight or anything, so initially I was going to try it out just for that purpose, until I saw the price, I decided ahm no.Anyway, so recently I had a doctors appointment because Im having issues...with the number 2 (ugh* embarassing), anyhow, the doctor said that it would be good to try out this diet pill called 'ALLI', and lo and behold, thus why weightloss is possible. He said I didnt need to lose weight essentially, so he told me only use it once a day with meals, as opposed to having one with 3 meals each day.Thank GOD I only take it one time, most of the other reviews describe the pill as leaving an oily residue after you use the bathroom, essentially the oils from your food are drawn to your intestins so that you can number 2 with ease, the more oily the food the more problems you will have with that oily residue... simple, just eat right.Works really greatVery Mild"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"This fits the 9 oz avent bottles. It works great and heats evenly everytime. You don't have to worry about how much water is left in the unit like you do some other models. This warmer uses all the water you put in. If taking breast milk out of fridge, their water amount is wrong. But it doesn't take long to figure out. Also the box says to wait at least 10 min before using again, but you can use it back to back. I breast feed during the night so I can't comment on the night light portion. I LOVE the coolers.I live where it gets triple digits and I can leave cooler in car while shopping and feel good about it. I had the little cooler pack bag type rhombus but they melted so fast! I bought a second one to keep in my trunk for when I visit grandma or anyone else. I originally bought because my husband has horrible patience and the stove top was not ideal for warming with a screaming baby, especially if he allowed it to get too warm. I feel absolutely comfortable having him use this warmer. Takes about 3 min for 6.5 oz bs like 8 on the stove"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"Its creatine and its flavorless. The quantity is good for the price. If you want creatine, buy this. Why not buy something else? Besides price i really dont have any reason to offer you; its all pretty much the same. I can say i appreciate the subtle label on the container. It doesnt have some obnoxiously overzealous name with a very imposing color scheme. Its simple, its direct, its creatine."

The bread does not stay good for very long though, I wrap it in paper towels and put it in an large ziploc bag. Try to use it all within 4-5 days.

This company touts the benefits of quinoa (super food) without mentioning that this product is also made with corn (not so super.)

I was aiming for that for months, nothing. I finally tried this test. I got a smiley face DAY 10-11!!!!! We did the baby dance days 10,11,12,13. By day 14 my breasts were killing me. I knew something was up.

First month, first try, bing bang boom....ladies, it works!!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've drank a few boxes of Yamamotoyama's green tea and I must say I haven't gotten tired of it yet. It's really refreshing in that it is very neutral tasting with not a lot of `bite' to it (I suppose you can also describe it as bitterness). I've even disregarded the 1 to 3 minute steep time and left the bag in for a stronger green tea and it hasn't disappointed me. The tea steeps to a nice green color (hence the green , tastes ever so slightly earthy. It's hard for me to give an accurate description to a newcomer, but there are no surprises in this tea. It's just a solid basic green tea.I would say if you're new to green tea, then this is a good starter tea to go with. It's friendly in the sense that you almost can't oversteep it and it's very light, even for a green tea. It's also accessible and `upgradedable,' because once you've had enough of their green tea, they have a wide variety of more expensive premium teas to choose from. If you want a tea to drink on a daily basis, I give this tea my full recommendation."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Used to take multivitamins manufactured by the bodybuilding supplement companies (Universal Nutrition, EAS, Prolab, etc.) but my wife convinced me to take these as a more natural alternative. Although I do think that molecules are molecules (vit C is vit C whether synthesized or extracted), I feel like the blend of additional ingredients (probiotics and herbs) make me feel great. Maybe a placebo effect but I've taken these for a few years now and plan on taking them until i find something better. One thing I noticed is that the pills are slightly smaller now than they were a few months ago. I haven't put in the effort to see if they've reduced the amount of ingredients as a cost cutting measure recently but I might inquire one of these days."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I took One-a-day Women's before trying Opti-women vitamins, and while I was pleased with the One-a-days, I still wanted to see if I could find something better. I did. Optimum Nutrition's Opti-Women vitamins are wonderful.They first captured my attention as a potential replacement because while researching, I recognized the company name. Optimum Nutrition makes some of the best and best-tasting protein powders out there. Their reputation is very good, and I hear their products recommended often. When I found out that ON makes vitamins, I knew I had to try them.The vitamins are very easy to swallow, thanks to the capsule form. They just slide right on down, and I feel like they're absorbed better because of their form.I've seen positive benefits from taking them, and I only take one a day (a half-dose). My nails grow even more quickly, and they no longer bend over, and I feel like I have more energy. I don't feel jittery though, and I haven't noticed any change in my heart rate as I would with caffeine, which is a plus. (I tried One-a-day Weight Loss vitamins before the OAD Women's, and I hated the way the caffeine made me feel.) I haven't noticed any changes (neither positive nor negative) in my mood or in my urine. I know that it probably sounds like the Opti-Womens do nothing, but in truth, the positive effects--though definitely there--are subtle.The only downside is that if I burp a few hours after taking them, I get the 'flavor' of them in my mouth. (Which is basically how they smell.)All in all, I really like these vitamins, and I know that when I run out, I'll be buying another bottle of Opti-Womens.Edited 4/21/12:Well, after a brief break from these vitamins (monetary reasons) I'm back on them, and I'm definitely noticing a difference. When my bottle of Opti-Women ran out, I switched back to the One-A-Day. Meh. Then I switched to the Target brand generic of the One-A-Days. They were awful -- my nails immediately started breaking, and they just didn't seem to do anything.Now I'm back on the Opti-Women vitamins, and compared to the crappy generic things I'd been taking, these are amazing. I *do* feel more energetic, even with a half-dose, and my nails and hair are great. (Except I now have to tweeze my eyebrows almost twice as often.) Oh, and for some reason, I'm now having discolored urine -- bright yellow, which I've heard is the B vitamins and nothing to worry about. I'm thinking that I probably had it before but just didn't notice it for whatever reason. In any case, I'm never buying another brand of vitamin again."

I try to take these daily but either schedule or early alzheimer's gets in the way. ;) When I take them, there is definitely a noticeable difference in my mood, appetite and digestion. If, for some reason, I forget to take these before/during my period, I get very weak. Everyone has problems taking vitamins consistently. I can definitely say that when I take these, I'm a much better person.Update 09/01/11:I noticed that I would frequently get migraines after I took these vitamins. I stopped taking them for a month and although I felt some anemic weakness, the migraines did stop. I switched to a different brand and so far, so good. In addition, these vitamins get moldy at the slightest tinge of humidity, which is difficult to control."

ValuMarket tends to draw a really culturally diverse crowd, and they still carry the Luzianne dinner kits!! Hallelujah! I only seem to crave the Jambalaya Dinner, but they do have others. There were 4 on the shelf, other day, and I bought all 4 of them! I've been seeing them there, consistantly, for years.Thank goodness for Amazon, though. I will definitely order them, if necessary."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,5.0,"They're just really good, they have some protein compared to potato chips but they still have fat and salt so they do taste good. But the sodium % of daily value which is 22 pieces is only 4% so that doesn't seem bad at all, I think there are bags of potato chips and pretzels and oh the worst are those corn chips, they are just like pouring a bottle of salt down your throat, these taste plenty salty to me. They're addicting so watch out! I also ordered some other snacks that maybe I can mix things up. Such a lucky find these crips, I just was hungry before my sewing lesson and stopped into a convenience mart and saw them, that was lucky, funny thing it was called Lucky Mart I think. I don't live around there and dunno if they have em here and don't feel like looking so I figured just order the 12 pack online. I read the snapeas mostly come from Canada and that they have good farming standards so hopefully it isn't so bad that these aren't organic. Trader Joes green bean crisp also sound good, haven't tried them."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I originally bought this MRM Whey Protein at a health-food store. I especially like it because it's low in carbs and uses Stevia for a sweetener instead of the other more chemical alternatives. I usually buy the Rich Vanilla because it is so versatile. I add a lot of cinnamon (good for you!) and it tastes delicious, especially when I mix it with hemp milk. I've made it for my friends who only eat things based on good taste, and everyone has loved this product. When I ordered it from Amazon.com, I found that it was about half the price, and with my Amazon Prime free two-day shipping, it made it very economical and quick to receive. I plan to order ahead of time before I run out to be sure I always have this product on hand for our morning ""shakes""."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I bought another brand of L-Glutamine tablets and I wasnt that happy with them because they were 500mg tablets and I had to take lots of them to get the dose I wanted. The other choice are those huge 1000mg pills, which can be difficult to swallow. But then, I found these 750mg capsules from Jarrow. They are right in the middle - not too big and not too small. I think its a perfect size.Another benefit is that these are capsules - not tablets. I always have found capsules easier to swallow. They also have less binders then tablets and no artificial ingredients unlike the Source Naturals tablets which contain sorbitol and many more random ingredients. Since some people take several grams per dose, several times per day, those binders really can add up. This product is a nice simple gelatin capsule.These capsules consist of:L-Glutamine 750mgOther ingredients"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"I've had two of these for over two years and they really didn't live up to expectations. When new, they looked great but any seat adjustment leaves permanent scratches on the wood and now they look really beat up. The screws fall out frequently and need to be tightened often. The cushions are stained and worn-out after numerous washes. The trays, while we were using them, could never be set completing straight so cups and plates would slide off constantly making for even messier meals than you'd normally expect with a baby/toddler. Also these chairs are really difficult to clean. The food gets stuck in all of the hard-to-reach places so they look pretty disgusting on close inspection. Overall, I'd definitely look for a different option if I were buying one now."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"Just came back from a backpacking trip on the Lost Coast----very tough terrain in part, with rocky cobbled beaches and lots of opportunities for getting sand in socks and shoes. I developed a blister on my arch, and was in quite a lot of discomfort. Fortunately for me, someone in our group had these Second Skin Burn Pads with her, plus some adhesive tape to keep the pad in place. The pain relief was instantaneous, I was able to walk the rest of the trip in comfort. Even more amazing to me, after a day and 1/2 when I removed the pad, the blister was healed! No reddened thin area, no loose skin. The area remains slightly sensitive, but essentially healed. It seems just short of miraculous, and I am now ordering these for myself and my hiking friends!"

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"When I ordered these tests, I thought they were going to be the regular +/- tests. When I received them, I just threw them in my bathroom closet until I needed them. So this morning, I opened the box and pulled one out and thought that it was a really ""hunky"" test-not even thinking twice that it was a digital test. So, just a little bit ago when I opened the stick package, it was a digital test! I was pleasantly surprised!!! I know the digital tests are usually quite a bit more, so I felt like I got an even better deal for 5 tests!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,Ordered 2 bottles of the One-a-day Women's multi after finding them rated one of the best multis for women...but got extremely sick to my stomach almost 10 minutes after taking it with my other morning pills. Was not used to having to eat with their consumption as I've used a powder vitamin from Vitamin World for years (has unfortunately been discontinued). Won't make this mistake again. MAKE SURE you eat something when you take it.
health personal care,health care,women s health,2.0,"The material of The Keeper is unpleasant, smells funny, and frankly is just plain ugly looking. At first I had a really hard time inserting it. After a lot of practice I finally figured it out, but it was pretty uncomfortable. While it was in I could feel it and did not like it. I also found that it ended up leaking. Getting it out is also scary, because it travels up and it feels like you are never going to be able to get a grip on it.I wish I had bought the Diva cup to begin with. Now after my experience with the Keeper I'm not sure whether I should even waste my time and money seeing if the Diva works. I am disappointed in the current choices available- the Instead cup doesn't work for me and isn't reusable. The other menstrual cups are reusable but not comfortable."

As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea. To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor. Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it - it HAS to be good!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"The limit for Vitamin A is supposed to be 5,000 IU and this pre-natal supplement is 13,000 IU. A study in the NEJM in 1995, found that among women who take more than 10,000 IU of supplemental vitamin A, an estimate of 1 in 57 involves a baby with a birth defect attributable to high vitamin A intake. I don't understand why Solaray has such a high dose in these vitamins."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,This is a FANTASTIC product. Do NOT order from the Direct Super Center. The company has a ton of complaints on the BBB website and is run by incompetents. Don't count on getting your order for at LEAST 3 weeks if you decide to go with them. Not shopping through Amazon.com EVER again because of their representation. What a waste. I'd rather spend $2 more at Wal-Mart (yeah) than shop from Amazon.com again.

I was experiencing the beginning of hot flashes and an irregular heartbeat (a little known symptom of menopause). Within a week of taking primrose oil the hot flashes ceased. Soon after, I no longer had the irregular heartbeat. A side benefit is I no longer have cramps during my period!! I wish I had known about this long ago!Highly recommended for peri-menopausal symptoms - an excellent and simple solution in the maze of peri-menopausal products. Note"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"At 35, I didn't think I needed this product as much as my 70 year old neighbor said I did. (He swears that it gives him more energy and vitality.) However, I started vigorous exercise and was hurting for days after. Joint pain, bone pain, chronic muscle pain. It was unbearable but I really liked to run, so decided to give MaxGXL a try. I don't notice any increase in energy, at all, but I have NO more body pains after my workouts. I only take once a day, not two. And just to make sure it worked, I stopped taking for a week and all the pain came back post-workout. Highly recommend!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,This is a great product. I particularly like the Tangy Orange but may try the other flavors later. I believe this drink reduces the chances of muscle cramps.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"This tea is quite tasty! I didn't mind drinking it multiple times a day. I started drinking this tea as soon as I reached 3rd trimester in my pregnancy (even though it is safe all througout pregnancy). Toward the end I was drinking 3+ cups a day. It is hard to say if it did any good. I was in labor for 80 hours with my son, which resulted in a c-section... but that was due to him being in a poor position. I don't think it did any harm by any means and I will drink it again when I get pregnant again."

It absorbs the bad food odors so you are sure you would not be smelling bad because of what you ate. Also very handy for food poisoning or when you drink the wrong thing. It is a must have!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"This is really great for getting those tough fungal infections. I have constantly battled with several infections all over and have done many things, over the counter ointments and sprays, prescription drugs, etc. The only thing that remotely worked was vinegar on my feet and it is tough to bathe in vinegar (as well as costly). This soap worked really well for me, and I started seeing results within a few days. My only complaint would be that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle as 6oz is not really enough to use as body wash on a daily basis. I would not expect this to rid you of an infection in a week or two but I would say that I have had much better results with this than anything else I have tried."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Well i herd of this like 3 years ago from my psychiatrist and she recommended it. I never got around to it but about 6 months ago i bought a bottle of 5mg-100 tablets, and i take 5-10mg each night. I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. I cant sleep with out it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,1.0,"I did my research before purchasing this product but did not listen to the warnings. I read that it gave many people the instant ""runs"", but having a self diagnosed ""strong stomach"" I thought they were just weenies and that I would be immune to these effects. Might I add that I have competed in natural bodybuilding shows for about 8 years and am used to taking all kinds of supplements. The first time I took it, about twenty minutes afterwards I had to run to the restroom! No Joke... Being the stubborn man that I am, I thought it must had been something else I ate and tried it for my next session. I am a true believer in not giving into the negative hype until I am convinced. I used it for an entire week and 5 out of 6 days, I had to make an emergency bathroom run! As a personal trainer with a degree in exercise science and years of bodybuilding experience I highly recommend you try something other than this product."

After reading the unfavorable reviews, I still purchased it, I only needed it for this trip and our family vacation in a couple of weeks. Well, it warmed one bottle very well...it took about 45 minutes, just as another customer said. then, when time for 2nd bottle, the light was on but it would not get warm. So, every 3 hours we were getting hot coffee from a gas station. I do NOT recommend this product. I wasted 10 bucks and some change!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Many days I do not have time for lunch. I always have a couple of bars stashed in my desk at work. When I cannot get out of the office, I will eat a Balance Bar. It is nutritionally balanced 40% carbs - 30% fat - 30% protein. It is not a diet bar, but a replacement for a missed meal. They taste pretty good as opposed to a high-protein supplement bar, which are very dry. The bars are much cheaper on Amazon then in the store."

This product was recommended by my doctor and I have been happy with it so far. I have no problems digesting it. I compared this product to New Chapter's iron supplement and these pills have more twice the iron compared to each New Chapter pill. If you are looking for a whole food iron supplement, this one seems like a good choice based on my experience."

For the last two years I've been fulfilling my strong tea cravings with Twining's Irish Breakfast Tea- it's strong and has a robust flavor. I never new what I was missing out on until I bought a box of Barry's Tea at World Market last week. Barry's has the most full, satisfying flavor that I've ever experienced in a tea. I can't describe just how wonderful this tea is. If you're a tea drinker, pick up some Barry's Tea ASAP- you won't be disappointed!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"I have worn these Spenco Cross Trainer inserts for years; but this time when I ordered new ones, I was disappointed. The first time I wore them, it felt like my sock was wrinked under my foot. I removed the inserts and noticed that they are made now with an extra piece of foam glued on the toe part. This extends up over the yellow section and creates a hump under your foot. I had to try to peel this section off. I had purchased three pairs and this was very trying. The Spenco Company should have left a good product along. I will NOT be purchasing these anymore, unless they change them back to the way they once were made!!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"I just got off a very frustrating call with Amazon Customer Service. I was surprised when I received these that there was only one pair of insoles in my order, despite the very prominent ""Pack of 2"" on the product page. After a lot of back and forth I was informed that ""Pack of 2"" refers to the fact that there are two insoles in the package, not two PAIRS. When I asked why all insole (or shoe, for that matter) listings don't state ""Pack of 2"" in their description the reply was ""I don't know."". As far as the insoles go, they are fine, but definitely not worth $13 for a single pair. I'd go with the Pedtag washable ones instead."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I can't believe I waited so long to buy this. I have suffered with low back pain, spasms, misalignment, hip out of kilter, whatever that's called for years. I've been to the doctor, been to the chiopractor and while that helps a lot, she would need to follow me around, dragging her table to keep me pain free. The medical doctor told me it wasn't my back at all but my hip. The chiopractor said the hip pain was because of misalignment and the fact that I had been that way so long, my muscles were trained to pull to one side, resulting in one leg being a wee bit shorter than the other. I think they were both right.Then last year I was treated for breast cancer. Treatment left me with perphriphal nureophy. Please forgive my spelling problem. That's different from the back issue, I'm sure. Anyway. All the back/hip problems, PLUS numbness in both feet from Taxol and you see why I was looking for relief. A year after chemo and the numbness appeared to be permanent. Oh and periodic numbness in my right thigh when I stand or walk a lot and sometimes when I sit for a long time. I was told that was due to a pinched nerve.Enter the Spine Worx. I saw one in a catalog several months ago and thought about it but never ordered. Lately the pain had gotten worse and worse, sometimes being so bad in the mornings that I literally yelled with the first few steps because of muscle spasms. Ibuphrin for breakfast, lunch and dinner doesn appeal to me long term either. I have been talking and wishing for an inversion table thinking that nothing could possible feel better than hanging upside down for a few minutes. But space to do said hanging upside down and the cost of the thingy - well, that didn't work for me either. By chance I saw Spine Worx on Amazon. Anything that has 331 reviews is going to get extra attention from me. I realize everybody isn't going to be satisfied with everything so the negative review didn't bother me. I was more interested is seeing what people were saying who liked it and whether their situation seemed anything at all like mine.I ordered it. It arrived 4 days ago. I used it 5 minutes at a time for two days, then increased to 10 minutes twice a day, where I am now. It was a bit tricky to get on and off of at first but honestly, it isn't hard to figure out if you're doing it wrong because it will feel wrong. It isn't a torture device so it shouldn't hurt a lot. Mild discomfort at first, yes but in a good way. You know how it hurts good when you get a deep muscle massage and you know they're working on the right spot, like that, but not, the feels wrong kind of pain. However, it also isn't a cushy pillow so pay attention to your body and you will know if you're on it correctly. When I first felt comfortable enough to lie down I felt several shifts in my spine. I started with my knees bent just to be sure I was on it properly. When I straightened my legs out I felt the most amazing pull in my lower back. I felt it lengthening. I felt the muscles relaxing. When I realized that, I felt my shoulders begin to drop. Holy Cow! Well I knew it was going to work for me and sure enough I feel great. My thigh hasn't been numb since the first day and I have been waking up and walking pain free. My back feels loose and I don't know how to describe it exactly but kind of like the pressure of the world isn't pressing on it. Plus as an extra added and totally unexpected benefit, the numbness (from chemo) in my right foot is almost gone! The left foot has always been worse and it still is but it's better. So much better. When I finished chemo the doctor said the numbness ""might"" get better but it also might not. After a year I expected it would not but now, thanks to Spine Worx it is better. I can't wait to tell my oncologist! Of course I realize not everybody is going to be happy with this device but if you're trying to decide, ask yourself what you have to lose. $34.00. That's it. And it just might work for you as well as it's working for me and others. I can't help but remember things I have read through the years about the spine and how important it is to overall health. Let's face it, practically everything runs through the spine. I might not ever get completely rid of my back issues or the numbness from chemo but in 4 days I have already gotten my money's worth several times over. I highly recommend this product and already have to several friends."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"'High Desert' is high quality! It has a mellow, sweet flavor...occasionally I catch the aroma of flowers as I'm working or exercising but there are no flowers, it's the pollen working it's way through my system. This pollen disolves easily, compared to lesser quality pollen that I've tried. My body craves it and is satisfied by it. I use it together with 'Nutrex' spirulina 1 tsp. 1-3 times aday. It's pure energy nutrition! This pollen is certainly among the best for sale here, or anywhere for that matter. My only issue is that on my second order I recieved the can, not the bag...since the can is an upgrade I have zero complaints and will be reordering soon. Allow a few extra days for shipping and be aware the package is simple cardboard, no freeze-packs and this product is perishable."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have used this product for years. It soothes arthritis, sore muscles and joints without the ""Ben Gay"" smell or feel.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"E! Network aired Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" movie, the one with Keira Knightley, tonight. I've seen this movie many times over the years, and the Oxygen Network and E! love to air this movie several times, but it never gets old for me. I could watch anything Jane Austen-related numerous times and still be a happy camper. Anyways, anytime I watch anything Jane Austen or British-related, I always find myself grabbing my Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea. Out of the English tea companies out there, Taylors of Harrogate, is my favorite English tea company, with Twinings of London and Ahmad Tea, second and third, respectively. Taylors of Harrogate's Yorkshire Tea is one of my favorite teas. Like many of the other Amazon reviewers have said, this is a dark, robust, bold black tea. It's like the strong black coffee of teas. This Yorkshire tea smells and tastes wonderful. Even though the Amazon description said that this tea is served best with milk, I find that this tea tastes great alone. I don't need to add anything, including cream or sugar, with this tea. This tea is truly top quality and tastes perfect the way it is. I consider this Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea an essential tea to have for anyone who drinks and serves tea to guests. Out of all the tea companies out there, Taylors of Harrogate, Harney and Sons, and The Republic of Tea, are my top three favorite tea companies based on the quality of their teas and the comprehensive variety of teas they offer. I also think it's awesome that Taylors of Harrogate are committed to environmental issues such as deforestation and climate change. It's nice to read that Taylors of Harrogate teas are Rainforest Alliance Certified. On the bottom of their tea boxes, they say that they have their own rainforest project, and that they have assisted in helping plant three million trees across the globe. I love that Amazon sells this in packs of six boxes. I have one box at my workplace, and I gave some tea boxes to my co-workers and friends during the recent Royal Wedding of William and Kate. Anyways, this is a nice affordable tea to drink and share with friends and family."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea actually tastes less 'spicy' than other chais, so the name is almost a bit misleading. It could be described as more mellow than bold. But, don't let this deter you if you favor bold teas. The complexity of this tea really works!! It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor. The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness. For maximum flavor I recommend steeping this for the full 6 minutes suggested. And, be sure to use two teabags if you're using an extra large mug. Love it!"

For years, I simply nudged the bear until her crunching stopped. Or I retreated from our bedroom quarry for the peace and quiet of the guest bedroom.A conversation about our family health plan reminded me that a co-worker recently went to her dentist for a custom-fit mouth guard. She received a bill for $500 and (surprise) learned that her insurance would not cover the expense.Equally appalled at the dentist and the health care provider, I researched a more affordable solution and purchased this kit. My wife was not thrilled but agreed to try it. TheDental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kitcomes with two mouth guards. Following the simple instructions, we prepared the smaller of the two mouth guards in less than five minutes.The first night was heavenly, all peace and quiet. My wife said the mouth guard wasn't uncomfortable to wear but she still preferred to sleep without it. I reread the kit instructions and shared the suggestion that she wear the guard an hour before bedtime to adjust to the feeling. On hindsight, I probably shouldn't have laughed when she tried to talk with the guard in her mouth. Imitating her garbled speech wasn't a good move either.In summary, this is a great kit and an affordable solution for grinding teeth (bruxism). I will post an update if/when she grinds through the mouth guard. My hope is that it lasts at least a year.Rating"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Have been using this product for a few weeks now & seems to help with the hot flashes. Would recommend.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I had been using Muscle Milk 100% Whey Protein Powder chocolate flavor available at Costco, but I really started to not like the overly-sweet, chemically taste of the product. After searching around the 'net for a whey protein supplement that didn't use artificial sweeteners (although this does use a stevia extract as sweetener FYI), the Optimum Nutrition seemed like the best choice. I went with the natural chocolate flavor because it seemed like it would be the least sweet.Overall, I've been very happy with the product. First off, it mixes really easily and well with water or non-fat milk (my two liquids). I enjoy the taste much better than the Muscle Milk; a lot less sweet and not a bad aftertaste. It actually kind of tastes like unsweetened cocoa. If you need sweet to get the drink down, this might not be for you. I think it tastes fine, but in the end it's all in the tongue of the beholder.I use this product as a protein supplement after biking, running, or lifting weights. I'm not trying to pack on muscle, so I don't know if this will help individuals attempting to gain muscle mass. In reading the labels on the Muscle Milk and the Optimum Nutrition, they are very similar products. For me, it was all a question of being able to get the stuff down and avoiding the sucralose in Muscle Milk. I'm going to keep searching to find a whey protein product that sweetens lightly with good old fashioned cane sugar, but until then I'm sticking with the Optimum Nutrition."
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,I wanted the ACE brand and even the largest discount chain store was about $10.00 so I saved a few dollars with free super saver shipping. The only downside is that this only has Velcro on one end so be advised that a lot of the non name brand have Velcro on both ends which is much easier not having to fiddle around when you need it. If ACE put Velcro on both ends I would have rated it much higher but the price is right for name brand if you don't mind the Velcro issue. I wish they would add this to the description for all of the bandages so I'd know.Next time I will try to find one with Velcro on both ends but I don't regret it for the price.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I love this stuff! I like my sweet tea extra sweet but don't care for the calories of sugar. Since this tastes a little metallic to me, I use the following recipe to balance out the chemical flavor:Boil a saucepan full of water, turn off the heat and add 7 or 8 Salada tea bags, allow to steep approximately 10 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Add 5 tsp. Superose, 2 Tbsp. honey, and four packets of stevia-based sugar substitute directly to hot tea (so that it dissolves easily), stir. Transfer tea concentrate to a gallon pitcher, fill with water (and ice, if desired) to make one gallon. Chill.Yes, there are calories in the honey, but not nearly as many as in two cups of sugar! Any time you need to mask the (SLIGHT) chemical taste of the Superose, use a little honey. The earthiness really helps balance it out while still providing a huge calorie savings."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,5.0,"This body wash is awesome! I ordered the 8oz rosa mosqueta bottle a while back and I can honestly say that it is the best body wash I have ever used. It has none of the nasty stuff that messes with your health and energy, so I feel great now that I use this. It lasts a very long time despite the bottle size(although I do wish I could get it in a 16oz at least). It cleans the skin thoroughly, leaving you squeaky clean yet not dried out. I don't need any lotion or moisturizer at all, and I've had very dry and sensitive skin for years. It works best for me when applied with bare hands as opposed to washrag or loofa. I recommend it above all others. Enjoy!"

These are great!"

health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"This bug spray works decently, considering my situation. I am a mosquito magnet and my house has standing water behind it (drainage creek, have no control over it), so the two combined make it hard for me not to get bitten. Last year I tried California Baby on myself and my son and it was as if we were not wearing any bug spray at all. This year, I decided to try this and it is a marked improvement. I still get bites here and there, probably because I didn't cover myself well enough. I am glad to have a safe alternative to deet that works fairly well, although not perfectly."

baby products,feeding,unknown,5.0,"I bought this support when I was 5 months pregnant. It didn't do much for me at that time but now that I'm 8 months pregnant, I can't go a day without it. It gives me extra support without feeling bulky or weird. I haven't tried any of the other belts, so I can't compare. But I like it because it's relatively lightweight, easy to put on, doesn't show under my clothes and gives me just enough support so I don't feel like my stomach is going to fall on the ground when I'm walking."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"These are great! They taste like cherry pie almost. I found out my husband has been sneaking them even though he can eat gluten. We are all cherry freaks in this house, so these are a winner!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,The flavor is amazing. I could eat this almost every day. The only thing I was disappointed about what the condition of the cans in the case I ordered. About 75% of them were VERY dented. Some looked like a hammer had been taken to them. Makes me question the safety of the food inside. From now on I'll stick to paying a bit extra and buying them from the grocery store.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I have one of these already and bought this one as a gift. It is absolutely heaven. Warm it up in the micro and you're good to go. The shape is what makes it so great. It is like wearing a cape. It fits perfectly and stays in place.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is a good brand and a great tasting stevia. You only need just a minor amount compared to sugar. Good price and good quality. I will purchase more in the future.

After a few days, I noticed that my exema was getting better and my skin felt softer. Because I didn't want to run out, I found the exact same brand, size, and mg's on Amazon for $15.99!

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,This set works as intended. One pick is good for getting in the hard to reach cracks to remove plaque and tartar and the other works great to remove plaque from the surface of your teeth. I use it once a month between 6 month dental visits. My dentist warned me to not use it too often since it could cause damage. I don't see how but then again I don't see a reason to have to scrape your teeth clean more often than once a month or every couple of weeks. Stuff does not build up that fast on your teeth anyway. Handles are comfortable and these tools seem of good quality. I expect they will last a long time.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This seasoning is Awesome! It is very light. Can be used for meats, salsa, marinades, chili, wow.....so so much more. I have been using this product for six years or more and it has never let me down. Glad it is auto-shipped. Now I can have it on hand. This was sold in store for a short period then disappeared. Hard to find online....Now available on Amazon. I'm so pleased."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"These were cheaper than what I had bought at Sam's and worked very well. They are very convient and I would recommend them to anyone not willing to make their own at a cheaper price because of the convience of having a good product, at a somewhat reasonable price compared to the marketplace. They tasted very good, maybe too good, my grands love them and could consume them at a high rate. Then I had to consume them to keep up with their energy. Truth is I probably needed them a lot more than they did. It was a good experience and I will buy them again when I don't have the time to make homemade ones."

(It's pretty useless when it won't fit your head) :) However, I sewed the strap back in place and am hopeful it will stay. Besides the minor repair, I am happy with the mask. Additionally, I have a rather small head for a woman, so this may not be comfortable for those with larger heads."

Happily, I found my good one last night.One other note"

health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"OK, so picaridin is not as effective as DEET and doesn't last as long. Now that we agree on that, lets look at why I rarely use DEET anymore. DEET is oily, picaridin doesn't leave the oily slime on you. DEET smells bad, picaridin has almost no odor. DEET dissolves plastics, picaridin doesn't. DEET has some issues with toxicity/side effects, picaridin has no such problems. So, while I dread putting on DEET, I don't mind at all when I spray down with picaridin.This product doesn't get 5 stars because I have now found 20% picaridin which is even more effective and lasts longer. I also found it for a better price in a store, so I don't have to wait for this to arrive in the mail (it almost didn't make it in time for my fishing trip.)"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,These are very good but a little bit too sweet for my taste. I thought they might be like raisins but are sweeter. I even checked the package to make sure that there was no added sugar; there was not. This is a nice healthy alternative if you crave something sweet.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"These upset my stomach for some reason. It didn't seem to matter whether I took them with food or not. This might be TMI, but it gave me stools like water every time I took one. Your results might differ, but if you get an upset stomach while taking this, you might want to see if this is the cause. I do however love Rainbow Light's Women's Multivitamin. It's the only multivitamin I've tried that doesn't upset my stomach."

They are yummy berry flavor and the cake part is very moist. Just enough to hit the sweet craving without blowing tons of calories and fat. And no wheat!! Yummy, yummy. I take them out of their pack and put them in a glass jar as soon as they are opened. Now I buy them by the case on Amazon since the groceries around us charge about $5-$6 a pack!"

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,This is a great nursing cover. Provides privacy yet allows you to watch your baby nurse. The ring like top is great. It's also made of cotton so it's breathable unlike some other covers. Long enough to cover your baby securely. Easy to adjust and put on and take off. Also folds fairly compactly. Highly rec. for nursing moms.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,Newman's Special Decaf is a great coffee.Good flavor. Smooth and rich. Smells great. Can't tell it from caffinated coffee. It's my favorite K-CUP
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"Pros:-The o-rings are genuinely waterproof-They retain their color pretty well, a few dings and scratches but the body of the color remains vibrant after constant use on my keys-Inconspicuous and easy to tolerate on a small keyring.-A US bill fits easily inside after being folded lengthwise and rolled, two will fit if you're determined.-Without the inner vial, a couple gelcaps or a few tablets would fit inside.Cons:-The threads squeal a bit, goes away easily with some WD-40Other:-The inner vial is not necessary for waterproofing, since the threads are iffy and the o-ring does that job already. It really only decreases the inner volume of the tube, so I pitched mine and just use the naked tube. Also, at least for the product I received, the inner vial is made of plastic and not glass as stated in some other reviews."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I got rid of my Multi-Vitamin as soon as I tried Green Vibrance. I've tried several multi-vitamins without feeling any noticeable difference. But Green Vibrance just makes me feel great!There's research out there from multiple sources that show capsule multi-vitamins just aren't absorbed completely. Also, most of the store-brands contain artificially created versions of the different vitamins, the hazards of which range from poor absorption, not being used correctly by the body, or being possibly harmful. Go to the Vibrant Health website and you'll find the vast list of ingredients in this are mostly all natural or organic superfoods. Why is this important, you ask?... Ever think we were designed to eat food and not pills, and that's where we should get our nutrients?... hmm.And to top it all off this comes with a good dose of probiotics, good bacteria that can really help almost any digestive problem.I tried it with water at first, and it mixes ok--kind of clumpy like whey protein. I wound up blending it with a little fruit and veggies, coconut milk, eggs, and whey protein for a great breakfast shake.Try it, you'll love it!"

It doesn't taste like chicken, but that's all right with me, as it's tasty in its own right. I'll buy it again. It needs something delicious along with it which I have created. It's called Reva's kidney bean salad. I make it with kidney beans, a Delicious apple that is diced, some pieces of celery, and a dash of mayonnaise. Enjoy a refreshing meal."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"This product seems to differ for everyone, depending on where you place the cover. I tried one of these last night for a horrific sore on my inner lower lip. It burned when I put it on, and the pain didn't fade like it did more most people below. I left it for an hour or so, and it was about half-gel, but the pain was only increasing. I decided to try and take it off since it was too painful to sleep with, but despite being gentle and using warm water, removal was very painful and ripped the skin right off my lip. Now my sore is way worse and even larger than before, and bleeds at the slightest touch. I won't use these again! It's back to Kanka for me."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I bought 2 of these for my kids. We wanted them to feel more as though they were part of the dinner table. It is also very easy to carry around. We went to NYC and found it nearly impossible to find restaurants with high chairs or booster seats with straps. I am thinking of taking these 2 seats with me, so we can eat at any restaurant. I found my kids using the high chairs to rest their heads on the back rest. With this they are sitting up straight which I think is better for them. Using it is very easy. There is a strap that goes under the chair you will use it with and can be tightened. There is also a strap that goes around the back and can be tightened. I have tried moving the booster seats while they are tied down and they are very secure. Once in a while I would take the high chairs to my relative's house, since it is not easy feeding them on our laps or running after them. It was such a chore to load up the high chairs. With these booster seats I have them unstrapped and loaded in less than 2 minutes. Also, your relatives do not look at you so strange carrying this around compared to a full high chair. We do not use the trays since the kids are big enough that they are table height when they sit on the booster. From just looking at them, the trays seem easy to use and clean."

I went back to my doctor within 3 months of taking D3-50 and Walmart D3 and my D3 level was at 86ml. I have tapered down to taking the D3-50 once a month and the Walmart D3(5,000units)(daily or when I can remember).lol.This product works to get your levels up!

For sore muscles, muscle spasms that linger no matter what other product has been taken, for joints, sore knees, elbows, and especially sore backs, this product works like a charm. However, using it in mild doses as recommended doesn't give the same effect that taking 1/2 - 1 teaspoon when the need calls for it. When migraine headaches are plaguing me and have my neck, shoulders and back muscles in a tight knot, Kava Kava works wonders! My husband, friends and I have experienced no side effects at all ... just relief from the malady for which we used it. It's a great feeling to get relief with no drugged affect.

health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,"This is some very oily stuff, and it has a pretty strong smell too. It doesn't dispense as a mist, which is what I was expecting. Instead it shoots out a grease jet that splatters (I actually got some in my eye when it splattered off my arm and let me tell you, this is not something you want in your eye). Also it attracts bugs, including biting flies and mosquitoes. I wore it in the woods and I was swarmed by just about every biting insect you can imagine. I was a mass of mosquito bites by the time I got home. I've never had that happen with other repellents I've tried.It worries me that in some of the reviews I've read people seem to think this is a nice, safe, mild product that you could use on a baby. It has citronella oil in it, which is known to cause skin irritation. The EPA requires a caution on the label because of that. I would never put this on a child.The only reason I can give this one star at all is because it does do nice things for my hair. As a hair product, if they changed the dispenser and took out the citronella this might be a winner."

My gallbladder has healed a lot since then but I still have to take two each morning about 20 minutes before I eat or drink anything and then I'm good for the whole day.

Since being on this program, I I have a bowel movement at least once a day, and after moving to day 6 of the program, you're directed to increase the product, and to start drinking the tea every other night, instead of everynight.

But every other day, sure beats once a week, any day!!!"

However, my last order of Muscle Milkcame with a ""new"" label. After reviewing the label I found that the nutritionalfacts on the label didn't match what was listed on the Amazon Site. The potassiumto sodium ratio has been changed to an unhealthy proportion. I attempted to returnthe item. However Amazon wouldn't accept the product as a return item but theyDID refund my purchase.Thank goodness for quality companies like Amazon.Needless to say I'll be an Amazon Customer for many years to come.As far as Cytosport and the Muscle Milk, I will not be purchasing their ""new"" mixture.Potassium to Sodium ration is very important in case you aren't aware."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I bought these as an alternative to the messy cliff shots. They are perfect. Also not too sweet. They are much easier to eat repeatedly on a ride. I definitely have picked up a little speed by keeping my sugar level higher. The strawberry is a good flavor. This is the best performance nutrition product since Gatoraid.

grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"These crackers use almond flour instead of wheat flour and are gluten free. They also don't have any of the ingredients that I try to avoid. I like the taste of almonds, so these were a definite gotta-try-it item for me. They are light and crisp and I love the nutty flavor. And, with these I don't feel like I'm having to wipe grease off my hands like with some other brands I've tried.Bonus was finding them here for a bulk rate. ~grin~"

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"My husband and I both believed in waiting until we were married to have sex. As we were preparing to be married, I did a lot of research trying to decide what method of birth control I wanted to use. All the while, I discussed the different options with my husband (at the time, fiance). We both were pretty uncomfortable with using pills, IUDS, and the other hormonal methods. Condoms are fine, but we knew that that wouldn't always be . . . enough. I found Lady Comp and after hours of reading online reviews, etc., I decided to take the plunge. I purchased it and began using it in September, so by the time we were married in December it would already have my information stored. Now, in July, we have nearly been married for 7 months. No baby! Just follow the lights, and you'll be fine! If it's green, we go for it. If it's red or yellow, we either abstain from intercourse or use a condom.I highly, HIGHLY, recommend. I can't believe more Americans are not using this. I've told some friends about it, and several just don't buy it. They can't understand that it's not the same as the ""rhythm method."" It's not! It's loads better. Trust me, if you use this properly, you'll be fine. :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have PCOS & was looking for other options after reading medical literature made me think BCP and Provera were ineffective, dangerous options just hitting some of the symptoms. I knew I couldn't use birth control pills if married, as they can cause abortions (plus I would be blocking getting pregnant if taking them, then risking getting cysts if avoiding them when trying to conceive). Plus the pills made me--a normally content individual--moody and sad. I decided biodentical transdermal progesterone was my next route to try, per Dr. John Lee's works from Amazon. But long story short, I tried Vitex in the meantime, desperate to try and stop cysts somehow.The product arrived June 21. I took it whenever I remembered, aiming for 3x/day. My period arrived July 8th. Apparently ovulation tends to be about 10-14 days before menstruation. So if the supplement caused ovulation like it does in some women, it likely did such in about 3-7 days! Granted, the timing could be a fluke. Perhaps I produced another cyst. Perhaps I bled despite or because of PCOS. A five-week period, beginning in March, is what got the GYN suspecting PCOS in the first place. But it seems likely this supplement simply worked. My system has been messed up since my period started & for 7 years or more I've averaged about 1-2 periods a year. So to have gotten a period after mine ended in April, then birth control (the stopping of which can mess up ovulation/menstruation issues more than the initial problems) gave me one in May, is impressive. And it looks like this one, rather than being erratic and as heavy as normal, is gently tapering out to end in about a week's time.Currently I'm researching ways to be rather sure of ovulation in a PCOS'er. I plan to try various free/affordable methods to help confirm I'm really ovulating. If all looks good, I hope to be able to afford a transvaginal ultrasound in 6 months to confirm more certainly what's happening. The original ultrasound showed 8+ cysts in each ovary. Hopefully the next will show I'm cyst free (since cysts can, per John Lee, reabsorb into the body)!! Perhaps Vitex also helped clear up my (very slight) acne. Perhaps it's why I'm not moody and sad, unlike during recent periods I remember.Important side note"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I started taking this herb when I first started nursing because I was determined to be able to meet the needs of my hungry little boy, and it certainly did help increase my milk supply noticeably. At first I was taking 2 capsules 3 times a day, but it seemed like I had an oversupply, so I cut down to 1 capsule 3 times a day. All was fine until my son hit about 12 weeks, and my normally mellow infant starting having screaming fits and became very gassy and fussy. I was also very gassy but thought this was a normal part of postpartum recovery.I tried eliminating the usual culprits from my diet, and never thought to consider that fenugreek was causing the gas in both myself and the baby. It's been about 4 days since I stopped taking fenugreek and my gas is gone, and the baby is much happier.I know fenugreek helped me establish my milk supply and has helped a lot of others boost theirs, but it just didn't agree with me or my baby. I've gone to mother's milk tea (which has a lot less fenugreek and many of the other herbs that support healthy lactation). Here's to hoping for more milk and less gas!"

health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"After having tried numerous other digital thermometers and none of them being accurate, I did some research online. Consumer Reports named this thermometer as the best digital and most accurate. So, I took a chance and ordered one. Guess what...it really is accurate! I still have an old mercury thermometer so I've used it several different times for comparison since mercury is the gold standard and it's always spot on.I don't think that the beeping it does every few seconds to let you know that the thermometer is in the right spot is all that loud or annoying as some others have mentioned. Maybe I'm hard of hearing, tho, who knows? lolSome have mentioned that the thermometer is not accurate and it makes me wonder if their battery may be dead or close to dead and needs replacing. Since I purchased the first thermometer, I got a second one for another family member and it's just as accurate.I like that it's soft and flexible...not uncomfortable at all. Very easy to use, too. It does light up so you can read it in the dark. Oddly, tho, when you are done taking your temp and remove the thermometer from your mouth the light does not come on. You have to actually shut the thermometer off and it will then light up for several seconds for you to read your temp. It does, however, light up as soon as you turn it on so if you happen to miss what your temp read, it will show back up when you turn it back on.Comes with a nice little case to store it in. I'd highly recommend this thermometer as I've found it to be extremely accurate with every use and I've tested it numerous times. Not a bad price, either!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I just want buyers to have fair warning that the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor tastes absolutely awful. I've been trying to choke it down for about a week - thinking maybe I'd warm up to it or find a way to tolerate it - and I officially give up.First off it does not dissolve well, which is something I've heard as a positive for the brand in general. Nope, not this flavor. No matter how much liquid or the method of blending there's always thick floaties and residue. That's even with a high speed blender. It's gritty, and worse - if you try to mix it with a spoon or shaker bottle you'll get big clumps that stick to your teeth like cotton candy.Those clumps - and the drink in general - tastes awful. If you've ever had powered milk then have the basis of the yucky flavor - add to it a sort of vitamin-esque pungency and you've probably got a good idea where it all went wrong. At first I thought it was my creatine that i mixed in with the protein - nope. Then I tried water, milk, and even juice to try and blend it. I even tried low fat and 2% milk to see if either made it more tolerable. Still disgusting. And you know what? It's not even a vanilla flavor - you sort of a ""cream"" that I don't associate with vanilla at all. I'd say it's more like almost pancake mix.. not sweet, not really flavored, just kinda of chalky and gritty with that weird pungent chemical taste.. Maybe described as like if you took Bisquick powder, added water, and tried to drink it.I regularly drink protein shakes so it's not like I'm adverse to them in general. I trust the reviews of the other flavors and the nutritional value, but the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor was just awful."

I always add some type of fruit to. e.g., dried cranberries, raisins, blueberries (after it's cooked), etc., then top it with maple syrup and milk. In cooking it, I use half 1% milk and half water with a pinch of salt and, as I said, cook it very slowly, stirring regularly near the end.It's a great, healthy way to start the day."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Both my wife and I are heavy users of tea and seldom does a day go by that both of us does not consume several cups of the stuff.Now right from the start I will tell you that neither of us are what you would call ""tea snobs."" We are not tea experts nor do we have any brand locality what so ever. We have lived in and used tea from several different countries and cultures, but to be frank, this makes little difference to us. We do brew a lot of our teas when possible as we do feel that no matter what tea we drink, brewing the loose leaf yourself gives a better flavor...something that in all likelihood is all in our heads. But that being said, we simply do not have time to go through the process, and most of the time heating a cup of water in the microwave and dunking in a tea bag is our general mode of preparation.Anyway, we have recently started using this Black Pearl by Lipton and found it to be quite satisfactory. The taste is good and not overwhelming. We like the pyramid style bags. I only add a bit of sweetener to my tea with no cream, etc. The flavor of this tea comes through quite well. Large leaf tea is used which is far superior (In my opinion) to that of the ground up stuff you find in many traditional commercial tea bags.The tea taste is strong but there is no bitterness and the stuff actually smells like tea as you are preparing it. The color is very nice; a rich brown and again, it actually looks like tea with not of the clouded look you so often find.Right now (by my very informal inventory), at least 18 different teas in our stash and that is not counting the dozens of different herbal teas my wife enjoys. We like variety. Right now we are using this Black Pearl...who knows what it will be next week?For us this is good stuff; we like it and it will be a part of our tea regimen.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"

Absolutely no other acne remedies were working and my dermatologist said I was a candidate for Accutane. After I researched it, I said, ""No way!"", and begin looking for zinc supplements again. I'm glad I did; this stuff is better than gold! I'll be ordering more soon so I don't run out! BTW, I take two with lunch and maybe one more with dinner, if I remember.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"For Christmas people typically give me coffees for stocking stuffers or ""those little somethings"" that they can give without spending fifty bucks. One of these small packages was included in an assortment this year. On the plus side, although it's a small package, without skimping you can get the better part of two twelve-cup pots from this at one scoop for every two cups.On the down side, this is one of the more unpleasant tasting entries into the fray of flavored or premium coffees. Clearly banking on the name ""Southern Comfort"". Personally I don't taste a stitch of Southern Comfort in this but it does have a weird artificial flavoring about it.I'd made a thermos of this one day and was startled at both the generally strange taste and the unpleasant aftertaste. So the next morning, not being one to waste, I made a pot of coffee with what was left of this along with four scoops of another sampler, Dunkin Donuts coffee. My wife gets up, comments on whatever it was we had, said it tasted bad even with creamer to disguise the taste, and grilled me to see if that's what this was. I confessed to this being about 1/3 of the SoCo coffee but tried to be encouraging, saying that this pot is 2/3 some other type of coffee. No go. She was going to pour the whole pot out and make a new one with the next brand we had! I hate wasting things, even if they don't taste good, so I had her fill my thermos with that pot before draining the last few ounces down the garbage disposal.I'm drinking that mixed pot now from the thermos, even though I'd endured this stuff straight up yesterday. For my taste I do find that creamer helps mask the chemical-like flavoring of the Southern Comfort coffee, or maybe it's due to the stuff being watered down by coffee from a different sampler, or both. But on its own, with no dilution with other brands and no creamer, this coffee has subtle overtones of the laboratory and a sour aftertaste; pack a toothbrush. If you already have some of this but haven't tried it yet, save it for when the in-laws come over and you want every minor nuance to suggest that a polite visit shouldn't last more than ninety minutes."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've been buying this for months now, and I'm very happy with it. I wanted something tasteless with no artificial ingredients. I also wanted something easy to mix with water and a spoon as I don't always want to take the time to mix a shake. At first, I was a little disappointed because after mixing it by hand, it would still leave little clumbs of powder. But I have found that by simply letting it sit for 2-3 minutes after mixing it, the clumps dissolve. The taste is exactly what I was looking for - it has virtually none. As far as the quality of it, I primarily take this as a supplement for basic weight training and it's great. It's also been great for keeping my blood sugar levels even (hypoglycemic). Would definitely recommend it."

I will try the 1 egg modification next time to see if there's any improvement on texture, so thanks for sharing that tip. I'm disappointed they aren't better, but it's hard to make low-carb taste like high-carb goodness. So, I would imagine this is an excellent product for some. I would just rather not have pancakes at all than compromise this much."

My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea. This is not a raspberry flavored tea. It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I have been using this Digestive IBS for several years now. It is a godsend that this product really works, and it is not a prescription drug. This is way better than a prescription drug, believe me. I take it every day faithfully. I am so thankful that this product is available and it does do the job that it should be doing. Take it once a day on a empty stomache in the morning.Thanks,Ladydragon from AZ"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"Some reviewers mention light coming in around the nose (something I haven't experienced) and pressure on the back of their heads from the thick velcro (something I haven't noticed). I'm worn my Bucky Blinks on every flight, many camping trips, and several weeks of mornings (between old and new blinds), and found them perfectly comfortable, light, unobtrusive, darkening, fresh... Others made my eyes or face sweat, pressed against my eyelids, scraped against my ears... these are perfect in every way!But if you've got a larger-than-average proboscis, or a highly sensitive head, you may need to darken your space in other ways."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS! After nine months of nursing, I had reason to start questioning my milk supply. My daughter's weight had plateaued, and I wasn't able to pump more than an once, so I was concerned that I wasn't producing enough for her. After just ONE day of using this tea, I noticed a very significant increase in my milk supply - so much, in fact, that I had to start pumping excess milk because my daughter couldn't keep up! I drink it only twice a day (the directions say 3-5 times daily) with a little honey and really enjoy the taste. I don't feel that it's too strong, like other have said, but I suppose that's a matter of personal opinion. When I reach my goal of nursing for at least 12 months, I will have this tea to thank. I HIGHLY recommend it to any nursing women out there. I'm so glad I found it!"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love the taste of this tea!! It's so sweet similar to honey or brown sugar. I actually take this tea to encourage my monthly cycle (my body doesn't want to cycle regularly on its own for some reason) and I found that this works better than provera. It encourages my own hormones without adding extra hormones to my body. I recommend this for any woman who has difficult or painful periods, or women who just don't get a period at all. It has parsley and dong quai which from what I read helps to bring on a delayed period. Which must be why it works well for me. GREAT STUFF, GREAT TEA!!!"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"This product description specifically states, ""Fits any high chair with foot rest"".

I am currently in the process of altering the food catcher so it does fit."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The minty flavor of this chlorophyll water is crisp and tasty without being overpowering. The taste is smooth and refreshing with no lingering bad aftertaste (some leave a strange grassy taste behind). Also, it is nice and concentrated so the same volume will last you longer than other products I've tried (and I've tried FOUR so far!) so it is a MUCH better buy! My only gripe is about the plastic bottle it comes in--it's very firm and doesn't squeeze well, so even with lots of pressure, the liquid only comes out slowly in drops so mixing up more than one water bottle at a time is a pain.My suggestion for easy mixing"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,Not an ice treatment is as effective as a cryocup for my plantar fasciitis. Many professional physical therapies use them. The ice contacts straight to your affected area and the blue handle is very easy to handle than the cold ice itself.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"Delicious and a good value.WHAT IT ISI was at first put off by the description ""antipasta"". I've purchased Spanish mixes which were mostly pearl onions and tiny cucumbers---tasty, but not cost-effective for the olives. I've purchased ""Mediterranean"" mixes which were bare edible because the flavor was dominated by hot peppers and garlic. However, this ""mix"" is almost entirely olives, with some tasty cappr berries, a few garlic cloves, a few slices of bell pepper and some spices. It is flavorful, but the mild flavoring does not overwhelm the taste of the olives.COMPARISION TO ""BYZANTINE COUNTRY OLIVE MIXThe similar ""Byzantine Country Olive Mix""Byzantine Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bagis about the same product without the caper berries, garlic, and bell peppers, and larger ratio of green olives (about 50% green with the BCOM, 40% green with the BFOA). Although I like the green olives better, I like the flavor of the ""Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto"" better, so the choice is is a close call. (I have subscriptions for both, on alternating months).PACKAGINGThe packaging (into a heavy plastic bag) apparently consisted of draining the olives and then coating them with olive oil. Amazon sometimes packages the bag (folded in half) in a standard ca 3"" x 8"" x 12"" cardboard box, sometimes not. If not, then the olives are likely to be damaged in shipping. I complain to Amazon every time this happens, but with little effect. But if All of us (you too) complain, then maybe we'll get the good packaging consistently.REPACKAGINGThe olives are very salty, saltier than the ""Byzantine Country Olive Mix"". You may be tempted to soak them in plain water to reduce the salt content. Unless you plan to eat the olives in the next few hours, resist the temptation. First, you'll leach out too much salt and flavor. Second, the olives will rot in a few weeks. Really.MAKING YOUR OWN BRINEI suggest gently but thoroughly rinsing the olives when you receive them, ideally in a bowl of warm-hot water (to cut the excess olive oil). Then drain and repackage them in your own light brine and white vinegar mix in your own jars, and refrigerate. The light brine will reduce the saltiness of the olives to an appropriate level in a day or two. It will take about 5 cups of water, about 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of salt, and 1/3 cup (6 tbsp) of white vinegar to your taste. Some people like olives salty, some like them vinegary, so adjust to your preferance. It is best to use ""sea-salt"" or pickling salt (if you have any handy), because brine made from regular processed salt can get cloudy.EVALUATIONSome of the olives are firm, some are soft---that's simply the nature of a true mix. Most Americans (like myself), raised on pimento-stuffed queen olives think that they don't like soft olives. Indeed, mushy queen olives are yucky. However, some types of olives are meant to be soft, and are best soft. It is an acquired taste, worth acquiring. The mix includes a large variety of olives, both firm and soft. It is said that the key to oriental cuisine is variety---a variety of colors, textures, and flavors. The same is true of an olive mix meant for snacking or as the basis of a light meal.If you eat olives regularly, Amazon's subscription service is worth considering. I'm signed up for monthly shipments and have recieved 3 shipments so far, with no problems."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I gave this product two stars based on the taste and texture. It is grainy, and definitely does not taste like vanilla. I'm not really sure what it tastes like, but it is very gross (at least mixed with a glass a milk) I have not tried baking with it like the other product reviewers have mentioned, so maybe that will help with the taste. I'm glad there is a product out there that can meet peoples needs who have allergies. Maybe the chocolate tastes better?"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is made locally at a near by town, and everyone around here always uses it, so I was surprised to find out that a lot of people have never heard of it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I actually didn't mind the taste of this drink (although if I were naming it, I think I would go with ""Fruit Punch"" instead of raspberry). I also have no trouble blending it with water, even cold water. I wonder if that depends on the mineral makeup of the water you're using. I am really starting to hate the scoop that came with it though. The scoop itself is very small, but the handle reaches all the way to the bottom of the canister. I cannot for the life of me fit the scoop back in properly. I've had to bend it in all kinds of weird ways just so that I can close the canister. I don't see why it's necessary - the diameter of the jar is big enough that I can fit my hand in it. If this thing just came with a smaller-handled scoop I'd be completely satisfied with the product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Im not going to lie this really doesnt taste like anything... Theres BARELY a hint of chocolate taste to it..Honestly noone buys protein powder as a replacement to chocolate milk. You want something that tastes good then drink chocolate milk. This is for athletes and people who work out.It's also natural so you dont get any of that sucralose and aspartame crap in there that causes cancer.All in all a good product by optimum.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,My husband has severe rheumatoid arthritis and just had surgery for spinal stenosis which means he's had to go off all his arthritis medication for several months. He has tried other products but says Biofreeze works better than any other product he's tried. We first found this product through our local physical therapy office. It was what they use on their patients. I highly recommend Biofreeze and a bottle last a long time. We are getting ready to start on our third bottle and have never regretted buying it.
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"So the boy and I had a little bit of a scare. With me still in college and him not working the ideal job, it's not the best time for me to get pregnant. I'm on the depo shot but we were still a bit worried. The doctor said it would be too soon for them to do a pregnancy test, but I got these just to make sure, since for the price you get so many. Thankfully, I got a bfn today, but will be retesting for the next few weeks just to double check. These will come in handy once we do decide to start our family, sometime next spring once I finish school. Very easy to read and just like the ones at the doctors office."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that."

I have sold magnesium and calcium products for years and specialize in this area.The 2:1 calcium/magnesium ratio works ONLY for people who have a fairly BALANCED body. People who have problems and symptoms, will require calcium in an amount that is either equal, none at all, or somewhere in between. It will be up to the user. The reason is simple"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,"Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for. At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops. Something must have happened to this shipment to ruin the flavor of this coffee. I could not get a crema on any of the preparations I used, despite using a burr grinder, spice-grinder etc. I feel as though I tried everything but a $2000 espresso machine and grinder to get a good cup...to no avail. DO NOT BUY this product. Stick to store-bought Lavazza or the great reliability (albiet more expensive) Starbucks etc. If I could get my money back, I would. I bought three bags with a grand total of $91 invested thinking it would be a great hedge against rising coffee prices. I reapeat, DO NOT BUY this product."

In 2009, I backpacked Europe for three weeks, walking over 200 miles in all kinds of weather and terrain, which finally contributed to arthritis affecting my knees. About six months after returning from Europe, the pain started to affect and limit my activities. I finally had to have total right knee replacement surgery in August 2010 due to the arthritis. The left knee is not as bad but also has arthritis. From the recommendation of a friend, I started to use Phiten Liquid Titanium on both knees morning and night.

They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,They are great for newborn feeding but a 3 ounce bottle would be better. They do work with the freestyle (actually any standard size bottle works with the free style)I was able to pump directly in the bottle and put a standard nipple and collar on the bottle and feed directly to the baby. I wish they were the length of the 5 ounce bottles because they are a little long to be hooked to the pump.I used these for about 4-5 weeks until i started to pump more than 3 ounces at a time (and baby needed 4+ ounces at a time).My current solution while pumping/store is playtex drop in liners and they milk storage kit.

I put a teaspoon of this in with my regular protein shake mix after a long lifting session, and was happy to find that the next few days were soreness-free. I had a very slight dull ache on occasion, but nothing compared to what it is without it. And, at a serving size of 1-2 teaspoons, this tub will last a long long time."

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"I just received my Proteus Mind Machine a few days ago and spent the week-end with it. Here are my initial observations:1) Several people complained that it is made of cheap plastic, but to me it looked like what you'd expect from this type of device. It is similar in size and shape to a Walkman and reminds me of home wireless switches and hubs.2) It comes with 50 preset programs, and you can design your own. I have not tried all 50, but I have tried several of them and liked some more than others. I have not had luck with the Deep Sleep programs but I think that is because I haven't used them with music. My best experience was with a program that I didn't write down, so I don't know which one it was, but I played Jeffrey Thompson's Creative Mind System across the Aux channel while running a preprogrammed relaxation session, and it was an incredibly intense experience. At one point I couldn't remember where I was; I felt like I was just floating in space. (I was not under the influence of anything except the machine.) I also tried using Creative Mind in the AS setting (letting the CD control the light strobes) but didn't think it was as effective as using it as background music while playing a complimentary program. I've ordered several Audiostrobe CD's as well as several more Jeffrey Thompson CD's.3) The device came with an audiostrobe CD that contained samples from 4 CD's which can be purchased here at Amazon or at MindModulations.com. You can probably find them elsewhere as well but those are the places I know of. It doesn't make a difference because Mind Modulations fulfills the Amazon orders but for some reason I think it's a buck cheaper to order from Amazon. Anyway, the samples were interesting as they really exhibited the power of the audiostrobe technology. If you've ever seen fireworks synchronized to music then you might have an idea of what I'm talking about, but this is more intense and more private.4) I ordered the ThoughtStream biofeedback device but that hasn't come yet. (I only ordered it after the Proteus arrived.) I am looking forward to experimenting with the two.5) I upgraded the OS of the Proteus using the serial cable interface. I had to get a serial-to-USB converter for my laptop which required that I also install drivers from the converter's included CD. I then had to turn down the speed of transfer to halfspeed because when downloading the OS it ended with the word ""bAd"" displayed on the LED. I was then unable to use any function beside the prerecorded sessions and the download function. (I didn't even notice the problem until I tried to use the AudioStrobe feature again.) Anyway, turning down the speed of the COM port in the Proteus desktop app fixed this issue.If I had to come up with complaints then here's what they would be:1) Damn wires everywhere. You have a wire running to the eyeset, a wire that branches into two wires running to the headset, a wire running to the electric adapter and another patch cable running from your pc's or your cd player's line out to the Proteus. These wires are preset at the factory to become entangled at every opportunity and you will spend an inordinate amount of time trying to untangle them from each other and from yourself.2) The idea of setting up my own session appeals to me but the tutorials I've seen assume you have a doctorate in several fields as well as an engineering degree.3) I bought it to help me get into a meditative state but I don't know what I'm doing well enough to know if I've succeeded. Among the 50 presets, only one refers to meditation in the name and it's a 60 minute program.All in all, acquiring this device requires an investment not only in money but in time to use and more time to learn everything you need to know to fully exploit it. It's a bit intimidating, actually, but I like what I've experienced so far and have no intention of stopping. (Did I tell you that I thought I was floating in space?)All in all I really like this machine. I wish there were more AudioStrobe CD's to choose from and less wires to entangle me but other than that I am happy.XOXOXO,djk"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I never learn my lesson with these bars.These do taste really good; with a thin chocolatey coating around a chewy caramel ""protein blend"" center that's full of vitamins and low carb to boot. The problem is that EACH time I've taken a chance on getting them, they arrive as melted globs instead of bars. Something about the consistency of the center doesn't hold it's cohesion too well. Sometimes the caramel center has just ""leaked out"" of the chocolate coating at the corners, but sometimes the entire bar is deformed into a crushed, melted, gooey mess.You literally have to peel the ""bar"" (I use the term bar loosely...) out of the wrapper which is adhered to the caramel. Sure, they taste fine, but it makes eating them a real messy experience. You have to scrape the mass from the wrapper with your fingers and it just sticks to everything. Kind of defeats the purpose of ""bar"" concept. It could just be a storage temperature problem at the warehouse, but they don't arrive looking too appetizing.If you can deal with eating a blob of sticky, oily whey protein covered in faux chocolate then by all means, knock yourself out. You may want to use a spoon.**Update** I purchased these again in the winter and they arrived in perfect condition, much more enjoyable when actually in bar shape. Amazon must not keep them in an air conditioned storage facility in the summer, ergo the melting problems. I've upped my review one star because I do enjoy these when they arrive as they should."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"The product is fantastic! Mixed in a shaker bottle, it dissolves well, taste good, and doesn't upset my stomach.My only complaint is that the packaging was misrepresented. Instead of the container shown, the powder was shipped in a ""resealable"" bag and the re-sealable strip did not work properly. I had to get a tupperware-type container for storing it in -- not the end of the world, but it was not expected either."

Last week my toddler woke up with what appeared to be a typical yet severe diaper rash, but as a nurse I realized within one day that it was a yeast infection. She was seen by her pediatrician and a prescription anti-fungal cream was called into our pharmacy. It did nothing and instead of the yeast infection improving it got worse, so while grocery shopping over the weekend I decided to purchase a miconazole nitrate (Monistat) cream in its place. I ditched the applicators as they were unneeded and this cream has worked wonders in the two days since I first began using it on her bottom. The redness is gone, the satellite areas have cleared up, and the major areas of infection are looking great. This gets a mom's 2-thumbs up!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I don't have fresh blackcurrant fruit every day so I'm not sure if this tea gets the flavor exactly right but it sure is close to what I expected. It's a refreshing change from the norm in black teas (plain, lemon, berry etc...). A few reviewers found it plain tasting which might be due to the fact that the flavor becomes more familiar after a few sips (the flavor doesn't last long in your mouth as if you're chewing flavored gum), but most tea lovers should still find it a refreshing change."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This oil works great for massages, dry skin, getting frisky, or whatever other use you might need some cosmetic oil for. It gets absorbed into the skin relatively fast and does not leave a long lasting greasy feel unless you use way too much - a few drops will suffice for most needs. The 4oz bottle lasts us about a year.It works great for soothing sunburned skin as well.I like using this a lot better than the various lotions you can buy at the grocery/drug store - they never seem to work all that well."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I saw that many people bought this for their pets and were having success, so I bought this for my cat who is having significant liver problems. It says to take this product in a small amount of water..at least 24 drops 3 times a day for a human. I took a syringe and put a couple of drops in it and gave it to my cat. He was so grossed out he started foaming at the mouth and threw up for a long time. I just decided at that point I would not put my cat through that with this product. I let it sit there for about a month and decided I would start using it for its liver supporting benefits. Well I took a small amount of water as it says and decided I would start out with about 6 drops instead of the recommended 24-48 and suddenly I found myself gagging almost as badly as my cat had. I felt so guilt about having given this awful tasting stuff to my poor old cat. I'm still taking this now but I use a whole 20 oz bottle of water and have worked my way up to about 10 drops. The awful taste is still there but I can tolerate it. I prefer tinctures so I'm going to continue to try this and hope it will result in positive health benefits."

health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"I'm a Scuba Instructor, Emergency First Response Instructor (CPR/First Aid), and my wife is a Internal Medicine doctor and ACLS instructor. I was looking for a decent first aid kit to keep in my truck for shore diving with friends. We keep a more extensive first aid kit with oxygen on our shop truck and boat, but I wanted something for my fun dives.This kit met most of my requirements for a little more than the basics, but wasn't going to break the bank or take up too much space. I specifically wanted a kit with an irrigation syringe, EMT shears and a CPR face shield. This kit was the smallest that met those requirements, and I was impressed with the other materials included.The pros:*good mix of bandages from simple band-aids, to butterflies and 4X4s.*decent mix of medications. Probably worth adding some additional units of the most common (aspirin/tylenol, decongestant, benadryl)*wraps, bandages, duct tape for immobilization/splints*well laid out package with clear labels for types of materials included in each sub-pouch*extra room in the kit for adding your own supplementsThe cons:***The included book is several years out of date and doesn't reflect the most recent changes to CPR guidelines. The three pages on dive injuries and pretty poor and even have some inaccuracies. Even some of the first aid guidelines have changed, and includes no mention of AEDs. While AEDs are not likely to be found in the wilderness, they are becoming widespread in general society.** The EMT shears are small and weak, not necessarily up to the task of cutting through 3 or 5mm wetsuits. Not sure if they would cut through tough denim either.General recommendations for additions (not specific to diving)-better EMT shears.-anti-diahreal tablets-extra aspirin/tylenol-extra decongestant-extra nitrile gloves-small pack of wetwipes-small bottle of hand sanitizer (unscented, highest percentage alcohol possible)If you want to use this for diving/beach:-small bottle of vinegar/acetic acid (for jellyfish sting)-seasickness pillsOverall, I still recommend this kit. The book was a disappointment, but as an EFR instructor, I wasn't relying on it to teach me much. Most of the equipment (except shears) are pretty good quality. It is small enough to tuck into one of the storage compartments in my truck."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"The tea has a well balanced flavor of green tea & jasmine tea. It tastes good alone, but a friend recommended adding & stirring just a little bit of honey to go along with every cup. Either way, it has become one of my favorite teas."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I purchased this liquid vitamin supplement to take a break from swallowing vitamin pills. At first I thought it was a nice change of pace to mix a liquid supplement in water or juice instead of taking a larger pill. After a while though I realized it wasn't really more convenient.I do believe this vitamin supplement is a high quality product. Also I believe for some people with difficulty taking larger pills and/or those that simply want to take less pills during the day that this liquid variety is a nice option. For me though having to measure and mix and drink another full glass of water wasn't more convenient than taking a pill after a while.This product can be mixed in water or juice and for me I found it to be much more flavorful to mix it in orange juice.After this bottle is complete I'm going to go back to the pills. If at some point I get tired of taking vitamin pills or have difficulty with them I would definitely purchase this product again.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this sauce mix and I use it many different ways to prepare a delicious and satisfying pasta dinner. I usually use two packets for 16 ounces of penne pasta (prepared) and that ratio seems to work really well. Just add milk (I use skim) and olive oil and whisk the sauce in a small pan on the stove! I typically add minced garlic and grated Parmesan cheese as I'm cooking the sauce to thicken it and improve the taste to my satisfaction. In addition, I add prepared frozen chopped broccoli to the dish when I serve it and often grilled chicken for protein. Serve with a salad and you have a great dinner -- and very quickly!My last remark is that I usually pay $1.67 for each packet in the grocery store. I recommend this sauce mix to everyone!"

health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,"Howdy from Texas. I've been using the Attends products for more than twenty years now and they have hit an all-new low as far as I'm concerned. These briefs (diapers) used to be the pinnacle when it came to adult briefs and now they are worse than depend or any other store band for that mater.I can remember back in the late 80's through the early 2000's when you could go to the store and pickup a bag of these for less than 20 bucks and it would only take two per day for moderate to severe incontinent. When Paperback purchased the product line from P&G; they continued to make the same product for a year or so and then they started making changes.The product is now very poorly made out of a cheap and very loud plastic backing and very thin, not nearly as absorbent as it wants was when made by P&G.; When wet, the cotton material clumps and falls down between your legs and collects there until you change. This is all after the first wetting.The tapes do hold good but you're unable to remove them without ripping the outer plastic. So once your have them on you have them on. If you are able to make it to the restroom, you will need to replace the garment with a new one because you have ripped the outer plastic and have rendered it useless.The absorbency is good for about one to two wettings depending on the amount. If it were a gusher, I would replace it just as soon as I can. Also you will get the smell that go's along with a wet undergarment. There is no hiding the fact that you have yet yourself.Now for the worst part, the leg gathers on each side of the brief will continue to chafe until it causes a sore. So you will need to find another product to change back and forth so that it will not get so irritating that you cannot stand to have the briefs on at all."

I don't use the other two extra trays since the brown tray is so easy to clean anyways. I take this chair everywhere since my daughter climbs out of high chairs. She stays put in this one. I suggest using this as early as possible so your baby is use to sitting in this seat. This way your baby will enjoy it more and will seat in it longer. I love how my daughter is comfortable in it so she is also comfortable at restaurants. It's so easy to clean too! It is definitely one of the best gifts we got.

The first taste was promising, apple cinnamon-y (but a little powdery). However, as I chewed, the flavor disappeared quickly, and I was left with a very dry and slightly sour unpleasant experience in my mouth. Upon swallowing I was compelled to guzzle several ounces of water. A few days later, I tried them once again, and invited someone else to try them. That experience had sadly the same result. On a brighter note, I have really enjoyed the deep salt flavor of these crisps."

I have read stories mentioning chicory and heard about its popularity in New Orleans. Honestly, and it may be my taste buds, it takes like regular coffee to me.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Magnesium is extremely important for good health. Yet for far too many years this vital mineral has been largely overlooked by most doctors. Shockingly, most laboratory blood tests do not even measure magnesium status although magnesium is involved as an essential factor in more aspects of health than any other mineral. Since magnesium status is rarely measured, most doctors don't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though about 80% of Americans are deficient in this essential mineral. And magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the primary factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. Anyone interested in learning more about the role of magnesium in human health should acquire and read The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean -- available from Amazon.com.The form of magnesium which is best assimilated is chelated magnesium such as this."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,These are awesome and really work! I originally got them from a dermatologists office and when I ran out looked on amazon and they were the same price. I highly recommend these to any wanting to grow their hair longer and have hard nails and brighter skin.

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,"I was showing all the signs of early preg, i.e., skipped period, nausea, exhaustion. These cheapo tests were still coming up negative three days past when I would have expected my period. I started to question whether the tests were accurate and so I went out to buy a regular pregnancy test. First Response came up positive 3 days past my missed period, as you'd expect a pregnancy test to do! and I have no doubt if I'd used them the previous day or the day before, it would have shown me a + result then, too.To test whether it was just a matter of my hormone levels increasing, I then went back and tested again with a cheapo. Still negative, 4 days past the time when my period was due. Not a recommended product for this reason. Buy a good test; these guys seem like a good buy but they just don't work."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,jams,2.0,"I love lemon marmalade. They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely. I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment. First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz). Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.List of ingredients:Sugar 62g per 100gGlucose-fructose syrupLemonsGelling Agent"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"Prior to visiting New Orleans I drank the usual national-brand, plastic-jug coffee sold in supermarkets across the country. After visiting New Orleans and developing a liking for C&C; (coffee and chicory) I've tried numerous brands of both medium-dark roast and dark roast C&C.;Of the two roasts I found I like the dark roast more (which Cafe du Monde C&C; is). I was excited to try the brew from the coffee stand we visited several times near Jackson Square but was disappointed when I made my first pot of Cafe du Monde C&C.; It has kind of a burnt taste to it (while the French Market City Roast I tried - which is also a dark roast - has kind of a chocolate taste to it).Cafe du Monde may be the preferred brand if you're going to serve your coffee 'au lait' style with 1/2 hot milk (as they do at the actual cafe near Jackson Square) but it's not the best if you're going to have your coffee with just a touch of cream and/or sugar."

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"Background:- I am 4'10"", have a very large chest, and am freakishly modest- My son has always been in the 90+ percentile for length and 85-95 percentile for weight- We have used this cover from the time he was about 3 weeks old, and are still using it at over a year nowPros:- Goes on easy and adjusts easily- Pockets in the corners to put pacifier, burp rag, small toy, etc. while nursing- Pockets are terry cloth, which is great for doing a quick wipe of baby's mouth if you don't have a burp rag or something- Cover is large enough that I can tuck it under him a little so I don't have to worry about him ripping it off, it blowing off in the wind, etc. (I have also used the pockets to stick my hands in and hold the cover down if he is being particularly squirmy...they are sewed on well!)- It can be used as a blanket for sleeping, or to lay on the ground for tummy time/play time- Can easily see baby because of the rigid necklineCons:- Due to my stature, it is easy for people to be able to see down the opening, or even just while I am sitting. However, it can easily be adjusted and moved to the side so that you can not see down it, and easily shifted back over to see baby again.- Using it outside in 80+ degree heat has caused me and baby to become outrageously hot and sweaty. We have a light cover I use when I know I will be in this kind of situation. I don't use the light cover all the time though because it is smaller, blows away easier, and I don't feel comfortable because of those concerns.Overall, the cover is great. I highly recommend it to anyone. If you are having issues with it blowing away, or other people being able to see down it just practice at home. It takes a little bit of practice with any cover to figure out what the best positioning is, how to adjust while feeding, what works and doesn't work for you and your baby. I have used this cover on airplanes, in crowded rooms, in church, in the car (not while it's moving), waiting rooms, etc. I have never had any issues with it that I couldn't find a solution for. Using a cover isn't any more ""natural"" or ""easy"" than breastfeeding your first child during the first couple weeks is! Give it time and practice with it."

The fruit needs to be somewhat soft, but this leads to juice everywhere. Also, if you use bananas the mesh bag is almost impossible to get entirely clean. I set my baby down on a towel with a bib on when using this product. My baby loves it!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was a little hesitant in taking this herb because of the black cohosh but I took it at the dose on the bottle starting 5 weeks before my due date. I also started using EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks and switched to borage oil at 38 weeks. I also drank RRL tea starting at 36 weeks. I had my son at 38 weeks and 5 days. I had been feeling ""pre-labor"" contractions for about two days prior to actually going into labor. I woke up at 130am with regular, somewhat painful contractions about 5 min apart. We got to the hospital at 3am and I was 5cm. (I was 2-3 cm at 38 week appt.) I had a spinal at 5am when I was 7cm. I had another spinal at 730am at 8cm. My son was born at 9am after only 1/2 hour pushing, 7lbs 2oz. The baby was 100% healthy and I felt really great almost immediately. I had almost no swelling or pain in the peri area although I did need 2 stitches. I left the hospital 25 hours later. (I would have felt good to leave the same day but needed to stay for the circumcision and some other baby tests.)Just as a comparison with my first delivery I did not use 5-w but I used EPO on the cervix at 37 weeks. I was 2 cm at my 37 week appt. My water broke at 37 weeks 4 days at 2am. By 5pm I had to be induced with pitocin because contractions had not started on their own. By 3cm I needed pain relief. I got a spinal/epidural combo. At 8am the next morning I was 10 cm. I pushed for 1 hour 45min and it was extremely painful and difficult. I did need some supplementary oxygen while pushing. Baby was born healthy with a very cone shaped head, 6lbs 15oz.I don't know exactly how much the 5w affected the birth or if it would have gone that well otherwise, but I was so pleased with the whole experience I will definately be using it next time."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past. Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival. Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn. Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it. Moths came flying out of the bag. Yes, moths!! Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag. Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths. We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn. We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products. We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back. We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund. We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility. It's just not good business. They have our money after all."

Consider it an energizer more than a relaxer. This would also be my choice if I were sick, as it has a hint of mint or eucalyptus, etc. When using, it lasted a long time before absorbing into the skin. I feel like it is a pretty large container for the price, it will last me a long time!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I really like this product.

I took out the pack of gu opened it up and took a gulp. The consistency is kinda weird,but not bad. And what really surprised me was the taste. It tasted very nice and I actually liked it. After 10 minutes I was feeling much better and I felt more energetic. The gu helped me a lot and I easily made it to the end of the ride feeling fine.

I have used the boosters that strap to the seat but don't like cleaning them. The crevices get very gross and I, frankly, don't want to dig in them. I have enough to do! The Cooshie boosters were great, easy to clean and move however, all of ours ripped on the sides. I did superglue them back together and used them until my kids out grew them. With my now youngest son, I needed a new booster and found this. I am so happy with it! It is definitely more firm than the Cooshie. There are some differences in design but functionally, they are the same. This seems as if it will last longer and it costs less. To me, it just makes sense to go with this one. Highly recommend!"

If it is a recent injury you use the cold pack and if it is a chronic need, use it as a heat pack.

I have purchased these Beanpod candles years ago from a store and always loved them, especially the Patchouli scent. The store in our area stopped selling them, I found this on-line and made the purchase. I WILL NOT be buying another Beanpod candle again.

Tried portable Oil-Filled heater (700 to 1500 watts), Infrared Quartz heater (400 watts with a timer), and heater blanket (200 watts) . Their wattage is high, and don't keep me both warm and save money.This is the cheapest solution (less than 100watts) per person for sleeping time.

This particular combination is not that effective and pricey for what you get.However the REAL reason not to order from this company is their HORRIBLE customer service. They would not refund the money, the rep was very difficult to deal with and if you have an issue there is no way they will let you speak to a supervisor to try to resolve it.There is NO reason to support a company like this. I am very versed in products of this kind. Give your money to companies with more integrity who care about their customers.If you haven't tried them, I recommend The ARthri Zen cream or pills. Better products and a company that understands what customer service is."

The old formula Cool Citrus always had a bit of a soapy taste, but the flavoring was good, much better than gross Accelerade. I don't notice any soapiness with the new formula Fruit Punch, nor do I find it to have any kind of off-taste, which I normally notice with artificial sweeteners. I have always been a fan of Cytomax due to its lack of sugar in favor or more complex carbohydrates, plus the easy mixing. Many people swear by Accelerade, but the foul taste, pour mixing, and crazy amount of foaming have always turned me off. Looks like I will stay a Cytomax user with the new formula."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This stuff seemed to work great for camping up on Mt. St. Helens in Washington. Where ever I sprayed seem to keep the mosquitoes away. And wherever is really the key with this stuff. I noticed on the second day where I didn't make sure to coat my body head to toe, that mosquitoes were still landing on me and biting me, but only in the areas I hadn't sprayed like my lower legs, or the back of my hands. If you want to keep them off, you really got to spray everything, including your clothing. But it's not so bad. This stuff doesn't really smell all that much and has a much lighter sent than actual bug bands do. And it's not super greasy or anything, so you don't really feel it on you.Also, it's Deet free, so I don't feel like I'm taking a toxic bath as I spray myself down, or get so worried about eating food with the stuff on my hands.While it kept the mosquitoes away, I can't say the same for flys or bees (or maybe they were just the kind of flys that look like bees. Not sure) I didn't have a day with it off to tell if it was the spray attracting them or something else, when ever I was walking I seemed to have one or the other hovering around me. They didn't seem to land on me as so much as constantly buzz me. So if you're looking to keep those away too, then I'm not sure if this is the stuff. But it is for mosquitoes.The only bites I got are the first day when I got out of the car before spraying myself where I got several in minutes and then the second day when I hadn't coated myself so well. After coating, not a bite it seems like."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,This rice blend is the best tasting rice i have ever experienced. I use a zoji rice cooker with fuzzy logic set on the brown rice setting. Iuse canned swanson chicken stock instead of water and put butter in the bowl before cooking. The net result is a mind blowing goodness that is nutty and extremely flavorful. The texture is also very pleasing. This is a great blend. If you want great reviews on your dinner presentation then this should be part of your dinner plate. Raves are guaranteed if you make it this way. I have not tried to cook it any other way as i have found gourmet perfection and there is no need to modify or mess with this good thing.

My clients have noticed a difference in their massages, they say that this new table makes massages more relaxing which I'm glad to hear. The heated top warms up very nicely and has never given me problems. The design of this table is wonderful, everything was built so well with a nice structure. Has an attractive finish and looks very nice in my business. I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend this product to whoever is looking for a good massage table."

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"It was nice to find an organic instant oatmeal with way less added sugar than the others on the market, with about 6g of total sugars compared to the others at about 13g. Those other ""healthy"" organic oatmeals tasted like candy to me.As expected, McDougall's tastes noticeably less sweet. Instead, you taste the oats and the apples. I'm very pleased with this product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,4.0,"I used it for my son for four months already.It does stand the washing machine, and is still waterproof.It can absorb lot of liquid.The only problem is that it is does not cover the entire bed, so it is only partial protection.I now use it over my luna bed cover, so if my son wets the bed in the middle of the night, I can take out this one, and still has Luna there.=============Review after one year of use= = = = = = =I bought two more sets of this sheet protector.Is the ONLY one that really stays waterproof.I also bought others 2 sets of LUNA, and they stopped being waterproof after few months of everyday wash.My son is autistic and he wets bed almost every night.Now I have 3 sets of this protector and it is a peace of mind because no matter how many washes, they stay waterproof.I still use it over the LUNA protector, and underneath the LUNA I have another plastic, because LUNA is no longer waterproof after many washes."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"The Melatonin seems to be quite effective in making me sleep better. My sleep doctor recommends to take only 0.5 mg at about midnight. This dose is about 0.5 ml, which is very hard to measure accurately with the measuring cup provided. I also feel that the sugar content is too high - even though it makes it taste good, particularly for a borderline diabetic."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"No smell as they say, well packaged, the oil is really soft and I used it realy easy...!Gets off even with tissue paper, water is far. :p"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"This coffee is pretty tasty. Not too strong of a vanilla flavor, more of a ""hint"" of vanilla. Better with a bit of milk and sugar. A nice occasional change from the Sumarta (now that's a good cup of senseo joe!)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I just moved to the Eastern time zone from LA and I cannot get to bed before midnight because of the time change. I tried taking this tea and even supplementing with Sleeping Beauty herbal supplements, but it does not make me sleepy at all. It tastes good and drinking just about any caffeine free tea feels comforting, but I did not feel any relaxing effects."
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"I bought these to protect my hearing while riding a motorcycle, and they work fine. I have to work at getting them rolled small enough to fit in far enough for optimum protection, but I have that problem with other earplugs as well, so that's not a flaw of these in particular. The box was very large, but that's not a real problem. For the quantity and price, it's hard to beat this deal."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,This product was recommended to me by a friend who was experiencingvertigo with vomiting. After taking the pills for a week my symptoms drastically improved and I have never felt groggy or sick after taking them.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I learned about arnica at an animal rehab class. Apparently it is used often as a natural pain reliever at their facility. I would not take an internal arnica, although people do. I like the spray because I have a painful foot and it is soothing. Anyone thinking of using this product should do their research though."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"If you're packing a wound and need bigger, stickier tape than the 1-inch stuff they sell at the pharmacy, you're probably going to like this. Personally, I love this tape because I only need one or two strips to ensure that the wound is protected and ready to go all day. Nothing is perfect (and you should always keep that in mind when purchasing any product), but this is the closest I've gotten to that panacea in wound care. I recommend it.I also feel it's necessary to mention its price on amazon"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product really helped me to prevent UTI.I had 6 for the last 6 months, and i have been taking this and i haven't had one since July.I take one little spoon a day to prevent it.It's much better than taking antibiotic to prevent.With this you dont have a resistance like u'd have with the antibiotic.I recommend it !!!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,Not worth the money. 11 dollars is too much for this simple item. you can buy better nit removal combs from Walgreens for a lower price!
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I love my breast pump. I bought this after researching other ones and looking at other people's reviews as well as pricing and this is a great middle expense pump. I knew I needed an electric pump because I didn't want to worry about the time to actually manually pump. I also knew I wanted a double because I wanted it to be as efficient as could be and if I'm gonna take the time to sit down or be mobile, I don't want to have to switch over to the other side and do it for twice as long. Extra parts are easily obtainable, there was a limited warranty, it's easy to clean and it takes 6 AA batteries (not included) to make you more mobile. I did find that I went through the batteries very quickly. So I just had to change my routine a little and that's not a problem anymore.The settings are really easy to use, and I can adjust them for my comfort. The bottles also come with tops so you can store your milk right away or you can throw a nipple on it and use it to bottle feed. You can also order different sized bottles to fit the machine."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"I love the pure, clean taste of the non-flavored Zico. After a run, nothing satisfies my thirst better. Sometimes I might drink one of my son's gatorades (he is allergic to coconut)and it just isn't the same - plus - the dye in the drink always stains my lips! Zico all the way baby!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,"I bought these bowl exclusively for the purpose that they suction to the table/highchair. Unfortunately they don't stay put for more than 2 seconds. Great idea, but absolutely DO NOT WORK, at all. My 1 year old would rather chew on the suction cup. I wish I'd have spent my money on more Take-n-Toss products."
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,I actually tested this on my upper chest before my face. I had a couple of dark spots there and it worked. I have not tried it on my face as though I am currently on the acne.org regimen and I read that the ingredients in this can interfere with the BP treatment. But this product really works. And I didn't notice it until a month later..but I'm pretty sure it was working in a couple weeks. I used it twice daily.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"When I bought these, I really wanted to like them. I bought the chocolate and then vanilla custard. Both of them are nasty. They have an egg like taste and aftertaste. Both of them upset my stomach so I have to say pass on these."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I first heard of eleuthero as being an herb that can relieve joint pain. A lifetime of athletics and skiing has left my knees in something of a less than ideal state. So, I found a product here at Amazon called Good Earth ""Ginseng Green Tea"" with eleuthero (aka Siberian Ginseng).The tea helped. Within a few days, I experienced a little less swelling in my knees, much less pain, and greater agility.Thereafter, I sought a stronger source of eleuthero, and let me tell you, they abound on the internet. However, I wanted eleuthero in veggie caps. I don't eat meat, and most pills are bound with gelatin or sold in gelatin capsules. Gelatin, like the product Jell-o, consists mostly of what's left of an animal below the knees. The butcher grinds that up, cooks it, and there you have it"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,3.0,"Campbells clam chowder doesn't have many (any?) clams in it, but lot's of potatoes. Flavor is bland. It needs to be doctored up quite a bit to make it enjoyable. It's better to buy a more expensive clam chowder ... this one is not very good!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,2.0,"Bought four of these at Target and unfortunately used the receipt to get rid of some chewing gum -- have been buying them for years, and generally enjoy them. Will never buy in quantity again. They're all STALE. Not the first time I've noticed that happening much earlier than the sell by date, either. Caveat emptor (buyer beware)."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,2.0,"Hard to mix, doesn't like to completely dissolve, foams up and foam doesn't go away. Make this at about 2/3 (or less) recommended strength. Full strength clogs up drink valves. Won't buy again; there are too many other comperable products that are more user friendly."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"Suffered from depression for a good chunk of my young life (21 y/o). My intention for this product is to alieviate the symptoms. I did notice a difference with my mood. Nothing major though, i went from being depressed to What i consider to be ""normal"". To me, ""normal"" is not sad nor happy, I was somewhere in between. I mood felt like ""blah"" or ""whatever"" if i had to put it in one word. To me, that feels much better than sad, i especially notice this if im off my regimine. There are other effects as well. I noticed that it help reduce my insomia, and that i also had vivid dreams. (which i liked). Please keep in mind that not everybody's phsiology will react the same. This may or may not work for you. I'd say just try it for a week or two (you have to be consistant with your daily dosage) then judge the product from there. This is not a miracle pill."
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"It is worth noting that these come in at least two sizes. The size sold here is medium, though it doesn't say so anywhere in the listing, unless they've revised it since this writing. I'm a male who wears size 9.5 or 10 shoes, and these were too small for me. Top to bottom they were so small that I couldn't fit the flanges over and under my toes. The front of the package says, ""medium - fits most."" But the back states that medium is intended for men up through size 9.I returned mine and bought the large ones from an Amazon Seller here on the site that specifies size large. They were a little more expensive, but I'm satisfied with the product; I wear mine most days with shoes and boots and feel little discomfort and, obviously, they are firmer than the gel type, which I appreciate.I'd give the product itself a five star rating, but I feel the size issue is important enough that I should draw attention to it. Almost three weeks after returning the medium pair to Amazon, and telling them their inadequate description was the reason, they still haven't revised the listing. I will change my rating when Amazon revises the description."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"This larger cup works great in a moving kennel, on a wire door. No spills. We bought 4 cups for use with dog kibble as well as water, for our 3 small poodles.We tried 'flipping' this cup upward while attached (as one reviewer stated his rabbit did), and it would not. No problems.For kennels smaller than 28"" in depth, the smaller #1 Lanca cup may be better IF you have very small dogs, like Chihuahuas.Neither of these cups is for large dogs with big mouths."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"My physical therapist used this on me, which is how I first became aware of it. It's not greasy, doesn't have any oily feel to it once on your body, and doesn't get absorbed very fast. I thought it was great when it was used on me, so I bought a big tub of it. Not gonna run out any time soon and I love it. It's the best thing for massages I've found for personal use at home. Would recommend."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I have been taking Nature's Way Glucommannan before meals for several months and the Glucomannan itself has been fantastic. It has helped control my appetite and lose weight, and my LDL cholesterol dropped significantly after I started taking it.However, Nature's Way just increased the size of the capsule from a ""0"" to a ""00"" size. It has the same dosage as before, it's just in a much larger capsule that I found significantly harder to swallow.Because of the increase in capsule size I am going to try Soloray brand Glucomannan, which Soloray's customer service tells me is in the ""0"" size capsule that Nature's Way used to be. I hope Nature's Way switches back to the original capsule size."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,My son moved up to these cups from the smaller cups with the rubber spout. He loves it and loves the cars charaters on it. It's a good sized up for my 19 month old and it fits in all cup holders. He's thrown it a bunch of times and no damage. The spout has an insert to use for smaller kids to make it spill free. It's top rack dishwasher safe and I've had no leaks from the lids with a lot of use.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This is the only way I make my roast beef, in the crockpot with this awsome seasoning. Roast comes out tender and melts in your mouth. To make the gravy I remove some of the liquid in the crockpot, dilute with a little water or it's too salty, then thicken on the stove top with equal parts of flour and water. Makes the best gravy ever!!"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,3.0,"I have yet to purchase this monitor, but I'm very interested since my husband and I have just started TTC for 3 months now w/o tracking anything. From all the reviews I'm reading, it seems like there are some monitors that work and some that are glitchy. Since this product is so expensive I'm wondering if those women who give 1 or 2 star reviews would be more likely to sell their monitor on eBay or the like to recoop their loss. In other words, I'm not sure if it's worth it to buy the monitor used if there's the chance it's unreliable. Any comments on this would be helpful. Thanks. :)"
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"Rec'd the above (title) and 3 34x36 of the Priva Plus in my order. I ordered 3 of theAmericare Ultra Waterproof Sheet Protector, 34"" x 36"", White to see if there was a comparabledifference, quality etc. Being that I had previously ordered Americare, also by Priva I amhappy to review they are 1 in the same both 4 qualility and price! :)) The 34x52 too large for my purposes. I will continue ordering either one."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I love this bottle. We introduced it to our son at about 1 month and he has never had trouble with gas when feeding. I would rate the Bottle a 5 plus, but I would rate this particular pack a 3. I wish you could choose the colors. I ordered two packs and 4 of the bottles had the pink tops. I opened the packs because I was kind of in a bind and was running low on bottles. We hate to use them in public cause they are overly girly. One of the bottles has little girls dresses and hats on the side. I wouldn't mind the pink so much if it was a more neutral design."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I use the Oreo pie crusts to make a frozen Milk Chocolate Pie that everyone loves. This is a favorite summertime recipe as I don't have to bake anything and the pie tastes cool and delicious. A perfect dessert. The recipe can be found in a Taste of Home publication, and perhaps you can find it at the TOH of website; if anyone would like to search for the recipe.Best of all the price is right at Amazon. Much cheaper than the pie crusts sold at my local grocery store.Recommend."

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,This was my first time using a product like this. The strips were very easy to use and discreet enough to use anywhere and anytime. The results were clear and easy to read.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers were expecting out of this. I've had a lot of microwavable noodles, and this is one of the better brands. If you're looking for Americanised teriyaki chicken or something like that, you aren't going to get that here. These are noodles with teriyaki sauce. One of the things I like about Kame is that the noodles are pre-cooked. They're stored in a moisture pouch with oil, so all you have to do is heat them up.Cooking tip"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I was reluctant to buy this product because I got pregnant very quickly with my first child. Now we have been trying to conceive again for over one year. I kept thinking the CBEFM was a big investment and we would probably get pregnant the next time around. I finally bought this and I am so glad I did. I am sorry I wasted so much time. I did use ovulation tests previously but I was so convinced that I ovulated ""around day 14""of my cycle that if I didn't get a positive around that time, I would stop checking, assuming I missed it and the test was just not sensitive enough. The tests can be hard to interpret, except the for the digital ones that, coincidentally (or not!) Clear Blue makes and they cost a lot too, I believe about $35 for a kit of 7. Those have a smiley face for fertile time and an empty circle for non-fertile time. Anyway, I bought this digital monitor and there is no uncertainty. The monitor tells you when to do the test, it tells you which days are ""high"" fertility (estrogen increased) and which are ""peak"" days (LH surge). It always correlates well with my other ""signs of ovulation"" and I am seeing that my day of ovulation varies greatly from day 14 to day 22! Of course it is no guarantee but if you are not trying on the right days, then you are not really trying at all. At least this gets you in the game."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I took it because my cousin recommended it to me, but this thing has me alert like crazy. I only took one during the day and it wouldn't let me sleep. I tried it for 4 days and i gave up... maybe for someone else."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"When the weather changes in the fall to cold and damp after a summer that's been hot and dry, most times my friend experiences a good bit of wheezing and problems breathing. He uses albuterol and an inhaled steroid, but the problems usually lead to a full blown lung infection that requires massive amounts of antibiotics. Someone recommended Oregacillin, to keep these infections at bay, and WOW- does it ever work!!! So far since he's been taking it, he's had no problems with mucus build up and infection and his breathing issues are much less severe than in the past- and this after that huge storm that dropped over 5 inches of rain and 30 degrees lower came barreling through! AWESOME product! Expensive, yes, but worth every penny."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I use these for biking. Very easy to carry in jersey pockets and the packaging is easy to open and eat while riding. I have tried most of the flavors and this one is great tasting. I like the quick access to calories while riding. I have used them on hikes too. Highly recommend.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"What more can I say? All the items were in great condition, tasted delicious, and made a great meal. I would highly recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,4.0,"This granola is not bad if you love chocolate, crunchy but not too hard with dark chocolate pieces intertwined. Good in a bowl with milk and good right out of the bag as a snack. It should keep that chocolate monkey off your back for a few hours."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,I received the product that I had ordered within the time frame listed on the site. Good service! I would purchase again in the future from them.
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"I recently bought one for a diabetic friend's birthday, and she won't stop raving about it. What I really liked about it was that it didn't look like medical equipment. It looked colorful, chic, and doesn't give off a ""clinical"" feeling. And let's face it, diabetics don't like feeling like they are a lab rat. Apparently it also does serve its purpose as an insulin cooler pretty well, too. But, I bought it for it's cute appeal, and love how well it worked out!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After I finished my master's degree, I lost my voice and got bronchitis. No matter what I did or what I took, I could not get well. Even after the bronchitis was 'technically' gone, I was still minus a voice. After three months of feeling under-the-weather, a friend recommended taking something for my immune system. After working full time and going to school for two years, my friend surmised that my immune system was gone. When I went to the local health food store, they suggested Nature's Way Sambucus Immune Syrup. It was $30 a bottle but I figured, 'What do I have to lose?' I began talking the syrup three times a day and by the third day my voice was back and the tightness in my chest was gone. Since the incident I always keep this product on my shelf, and if I start feeling unwell I begin taking it immediately. In most cases, the syrup prevents the cold from truly forming.Needless to say, I recommend this product to all my friends-especially if they have difficulty kicking a cold-and the results are consistent. I even recommended this product to a friend who simultaneously developed H1N1 and pneumonia, got well, and a few weeks later had a repeat performance of pneumonia. Within a few days of taking the product, she felt 100% better.I can't recommend this product enough!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"The chews are sweet so it's an easy way to get the phytosterols needed to help lower cholestorol. I also use the Benecol spread which I buy in the grocery store. It's a good combination to get the daily ""dose""."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We've been using this rack for 9 months now, and it's been great! Not too big, lots of spaces for bottles/nipples/rings. Easy to clean. I did accidentally melt the pole in the middle in the dishwasher, so we're just using the bottom level, but even that works great. It is a little flimsy, but does the job! I would totally buy this again."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I bought 4 of these after knee surgery in Vale, Colorado 15 years ago at the Steadman-Hawkins clinic at their recommendation. They are absolutely fantastic. Expensive, YES, but they are worth every penny. I have had a dozen athletic injuries and as many surgeries, You will not find a better product to ice and injury or surgery.They will not burn your skin and will last about 40 minutes which is all you want per session. Throw them in the freezer and they are ready to go again in about 2 hours. Buy 2 or 3 so you have fresh ones at all times. I've had neighbors and friends want to pay me $20 because I let them have them for a week.Make sure you get the right size. I have the 8"" x 20"" which is a ""LARGE"" and works for knees, arms etc but they make speciality products for shoulders etc. Mine are in the freezer at all times. Buy um you'll loveum."

health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,When I was using this I didn't have any hot flashes and I am in perimenopause so I need to get some more of this. I also didn't feel numb fingers. I know that is a symptom of low progesterone. This product is very helpful for menopausal women. It think my eyebrows were thicker but it has been a while since I have used this. I put it on once a day like it said you can. But I think it says twice a day or when you need it. Plus I skipped a week and then used it for three weeks.
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,This stuff is kind of like hydrogen peroxide and neosporin in one pet friendly container. It kills all of the bacteria while helping the area to heal. I used it on my turtle's shell rot after reading that this was the stuff to get and it cleared up my turtle's shell. I can barely tell where his shell rot was.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"REally Good Product best than expected.. my mom has arthrosis, and it is a painfull disease..since she began to take 2 cap per day, the pain and stiffness of their hands stopped in less than a week. This product is the best that we had tryed, before this I bought others with any result, but doctor's best is better than those drugs that are more expensive.. so if you suffer this kind of pain take this product twice a day you gonna feel much better..Trust me..You are not gonna regret it."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I tried this product for the first time at a friend's house. I first tasted it in a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit. It had a very nice flavor without being too sweet. I have used it to sweeten many other things including tea. It gives things a delightful flavor. Very unique.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"I bought this chair for my grandson to use at restaurants because he couldnt sit up properly, at 5 months old, in the wooden high chairs that they have at most restaurants. Well he didnt like this one and it was difficult to take with us because it didnt fold up easily. So I just decided to use it at home. The big flaw in the design is that, when he got older, the seatbelt doesnt hold him in. I couldnt even go out to the kitchen to get something without having to run back to find him trying to stand up in the seat, no matter how tight I tightened the belt he could still stand up in the seat. Also it is not a wipeable material. It is washable, but it is really difficult to take apart to wash. If they put shoulder straps in this seat and made it easier to get apart to wash it would be so much better. As it is I put it away and bought a regular highchair before he could fall out of this one and get hurt. I would not recommend this at all."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,fruit leather,5.0,"The wording says you are selling fruit leather but what is pictured is fruit strips. These are two different products all together. They are both good products however one of them is equivalent to ""1/2"" fruit in a diabetic diet and one of them is equivalent to ""1"" complete fruit in a diabetic diet. DIABETICS BEWARE."
health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,This product works well for me. Don't be alarmed by all the negative reviews on it. I've been using cream for almost a month and my breast are firmer. I notice that they are sometimes tender and that lets me know its working. It doesn't leave a sticky feeling if you rub it in good enough. And I still have half the bottle so i'll continue to use and will definately buy more!!!! Try it out it won't hurt...it might just work for you like it does for me...and its cheap..you can't beat that!!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I do not understand where the 7 grams of sugar per serving comes from! The overly-sweet taste is overwhelming. I would rather have other treats with the same amount of sugar. No sugars appear in the ingredients list. If it's fruit sugar, I may reconsider my rating."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,I order doctors carb block usually 1 or 2 bottles at a time-- this last time ordered 6 bottles but didn't catch the size of the bottle - bottle was 60 tablets not 120 tablets like I usually get so not as good a deal as I thought but is still a good product and very convenient to order on line thru Amazon
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"For me, this is the only product which controls my candida issues safely. I will continue to purchase it for that reason."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I recently moved my child from the highchair to the table and after searching for the perfect booster seat, I bought this one. What a great buy! I was looking for something that could be easily cleaned, moved from chair to chair, and would not damage my kitchen chairs....and I found it with this seat!!!! The best part is the ease of cleaning it as there are no cracks for food to get stuck in. My biggest worry when purchasing this was if it would stay put with my very antsy toddler sitting in it, and it does! It grips right to the chair when sitting on it. I love this booster and would definitely recommend buying it! And the color is just fine."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I am not sure what this has done for me. I have felt no noticable effects. Umm My acne scars may have been fading faster but I also started using a new acne treatment system so that could be it too. Anyways its quite cheap and has been proven to help keep your body healthy so I do reccomend it just as a daily supplement.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,I like it so much I wake up happy every morning just thinking of my bowl... yum! I like pretty much all the flavors - except that some of them's fruits can be a little tough (especially the banana bites on the rainforest flavor - i usually take them away)
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Doctor recommended these caps. Have been taking them for about a year. Used to get colds all the time. Have had one cold since taking these vitamins. Feel much better and vitamin B levels are great.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,Started taking this and i felt the result immediately on the very first day i took them.I took just 2 caps that day and i was able to run faster and keep the pace for longer time.no side effects that i have noticed.
health personal care,health care,foot care,2.0,"Product came promptly. As other reviewers commented, the product gel-ed up and became unusable for me also after a couple weeks. Now I need to seek a different product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Good whey protein for great price. Tastes pretty good. Mixes pretty good in a shaker cup. Uses mostly whey isolate, which is good. No complaints."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,Great product that gives a long-lasting effect WITHOUT jitters or other side effects. I wouldn't recommend a daily dose but stagger it otherwise the bodywill adapt. I have taking this product for a few years and have experienced absolutely no side effects!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea actually has a soothing, relaxing effect that is noticeable. It's like a mild sedative--very mild. Its affects last perhaps a half an hour. But if you want something to help you relax and get in the mood for a good night's sleep, it's just right. Also, this tea tastes fantastic. Even though it has valerian root in it, which in capsule form smells light rotting gym socks, the tea has this minty, herby, sweet aftertaste that makes it good all by itself, even aside from the relaxing affects."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,So happy I could get this replacement part rather than having to buy a new set. now it is as good as new
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,stopped working less than one year after i got it and homedics would not even send a reply to emails. the sound would go out whenever you turned it up above 2/3 volume. in addition to that anythimg less than 2/3 volume is way to quiet.
grocery gourmet food,baby food,fruit,5.0,Gerber's Peach Cobbler tastes amazing...just like real peach cobbler but without the added sugars and butter. My husband and I tried it to see why our daughter liked it so much and we quickly figured out that it was the best tasting baby food we've purchased and at a great price.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,Used this for my incontinent dog on the rug next to the bed. Works great. Also put it on the couch cushions under a blanket also and in the back seat of my car. Wash and dry great.

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I foster and hand feed baby kittens fresh from the ""oven"" so to speak and one of the most important things to do when caring for neonatal kittens is to ALWAYS have a constant heat source available to them since they're unable to regulate their own body temperatures until around 3 weeks. After researching high and low and not having much luck with finding a heating pad that does NOT automatically turn off I found this gem. It has worked PERFECTLY through two litters so far. It is cheaply made but then I didn't buy it for it's fantastic looks and when I use it it's bundled inside towels and blankets anyway. I've not had any issues with spontaneous combustion (I'm thinking that's more the rarity that you'd find with any electrical product as opposed to this one in particular judging from all of the previous rave reviews as well as my own!) I plan to get at least two more before winter comes on to keep with the older kittens, not necessarily because they're unable to regulate their temperatures but because they love warm spots to sleep and it'll get them out of our bed! :)I HIGHLY recommend this product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is a very interesting tea because it requires no sugar. It is perfect right out of the tea bag. It has an interesting rich and robust taste that is quite spicy. My husband likes it cold but I prefer it hot.
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,My husband takes these pills and is miserable without them. This is the only place I can find them and am very grateful.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"I've tried about a half dozen different ThinkThin Protein Bar flavors. But, this is the only one I consistently re-order. Some of their flavors are virtually inedible, either artificial-tasting or too sweet like a candy bar. This one is just right.It makes a great on-the-go breakfast for those early mornings when I don't have a chance to eat a real breakfast. One bar in the car plus a low-fat yogurt after I get to work, and I'm set until lunch.BTW, I've never had an issue with freshness, unlike a few other unlucky reviewers. But, I do notice that Amazon now shrink wraps the boxes in a thick green plastic. Perhaps this is as a response to complaints about stale product? It's been working, in my case."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter. The only thing I don't understand is the price. This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I'm actually online to order this again. BSN Syntha-6 Vanilla Ice cream flavor is the absolute best. I like to mix it with almond milk and drink it after my workouts.

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I am very impressed with this product! I used this on a boating trip in the Mediterranean. I spent all my time, even slept nights, on the deck. No bites even with very light coverage! I was hesitant to purchase this product at first secondary to the reviewers who commented on the unpleasant smell. I did not find the smell to be at all offensive. I was on the boat with 16 other people and all spontaneously commented on the pleasant smell."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have suffered from migraines for quite some time; to be honest most of my life. Sam-e increases my mood and makes me feel good and does ease my headaches a great deal.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"I bought these bottles to store essential oils but there is a slight problem... it works great for liquidy oils such as tea tree but if your storing thicker oils such as Vit E, Almond, lavander oils it won't drip out of the dropper. The holes too tiny. So I had to take it off and just use as is. But great storage and the size is practicle to transport around in small cosmetic bags. Just be warned about the eurodroppers. Otherwise, would have given it a 5 stars."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,My wife claims it makes the best chocolate chip cookies and pancakes and waffles. She has recommended it to many friends and they are extremely pleased with the results.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"These pads work great...my daughter has occasional accidents at night and these keep the sheets under her dry. She is using a bed alarm now and is almost finished with nighttime training but before, she had huge accidents and it held all of the liquid without anything seeping through to the sheet underneath. We now bring them with us when we go on vacation to prevent any embarrasing accidents at hotels or relatives homes (just in case); they fold up compactly and don't take much room in the suitcase. My daughter doesn't move around a lot at night, so there is no problem of her moving off of them and having an accident on another part of the bed. If your child or loved one moves around a lot, I would recommend getting the larger type that tuck under each side of the bed to hold it in place."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"All that needs to be said is, AMAZING.... as soon as I starting taking these vitamins I felt so much better."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"As my title states, my life would be very hard if I hadn't discovered these soles. Prior to their use, I dealt with knee pain, achilles pain and flat feet. Since I started using these babies...no problem at all. I have to wear these in all of my shoes. If not, then I would constantly be in pain. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The tea tastes very good. I used a coffee machine with a filter. I put a few spoon fulls in there, and what it usually comes down to is 2-4 cups of tea is all you need for that good energy boost!Thanks."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,The natural vitamin seems to work better than my old vitamins and the price was exceptional.This was a great deal.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I have loved the flavor of regular Gold Standard Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream, but I just received this natural version and find it almost undrinkable because it has such an extreme artificial sweetener taste. I don't have the ingredient list with me at the moment, so I can't see the sweetener that is used--I guess it has to be something natural, maybe stevia?--but whatever it is, there is too much of it. With the other powders I would mix with milk, but this one was so strong that I have to mix with water and use only 3/4 of a scoop instead of a whole scoop just to be able to drink it (and that is not even enjoyable)."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"good but you have to keep buying it, they sell a tshirt but are like 23 a pop.i ended up getting hanes white shirts for $8 a pack of 3 and for the winter i shall be fine."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Both my mate and I suffer from anxiety. For years wesquabbled when one or both of us felt uptight. By using inositol/choline we are getting along better and sleeping better.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,"The shake is watery and makes me want to chug a gallon of bleach to remove the horrific aftertaste. It also contains soy, which is an ESTROGEN! I just bought these for the extra protein, but if I were a guy interested in building muscle, the last thing I'd drink is something with (essentially) estrogen in it (which, by the way, is also bad for women to consume, unless you like cancer). Even if you don't find the taste as foul as I do, do some research before you consider eating hormones (i.e., soy). It's my fault for not reading the ingredients, but this product does not deserve favorable reviews with regard to flavor. *Shudder*"
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,My star rating might be unfair to the product. The product is watery whereas the the scar gel samples I received from a plastic surgeon's office were thick and went on like a protective coating. The Spenco Scar Gel didn't inspire my confidence. The location of my scar (on my face) and the watery consistency of the 'gel' resulted in my regretting purchasing the product even though it was less expensive and had good reviews.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"It is o.k. but if you are truly looking for pain relief, this is not the one to buy. It does not relieve the pain as much as watkins red pain relief liniment."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have been using Bragg's ACV for about 2 years now and all I can say is that it has changed my life. I used to be sluggish all the time, having that ""cobweb in the brain"" feeling every day. Since using the ACV I have incredible energy and stamina and sleep well at night as well! I have not been sick at all and my legs and knees feel the best they ever have. Ironically, I ran out of vinegar about two months ago and for some reason kept forgetting to pick up a new bottle. Two weeks went by and I started feeling awful again. I had forgotten how it felt to be off the vinegar and was returning to my sluggish ways. I bought some more and almost immediately felt great again!! I know it sounds crazy but you have to experience it for yourself. My cholseterol even dropped under 200 which it never has...my doctor was amazed! He said to keep doing what I am doing. I am a user for life - I absolutely love this product! As far as the taste is concerned, I put a teaspoon in a 4 ounce glass of water and drink 2 of them. It goes down so easily - I actually look forward to the taste!!!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"Every first aid kit, be it for home, work, or for your automobile should have some of these packets. It doesn't have to be a fire burn to qualify, a sun burn or skinned knee type burn can be cleaned, protected, and made to feel so much better."

health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"I've got a bad case of plantar fasciitis, so I decided to give these a try based on the great reviews. I wore them at work for an entire week, but I had to remove them because it felt like they were actually making the pain worse. They were also very awkward feeling the entire time I wore them. They seemed too soft, providing absolutely no support to my heels."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,2.0,"Prior to buying this product, I read a couple of the reviews but my sister told me that she tried it & did not experience any ""anal discharge.""The first 2 days I started on it, I noticed that when I did use the toilet, that there was like orange oil floating in it, but I had no idea where it came from because it wasn't evident.It does not hurt when it happened, so it wasn't that big of a deal.It began to be embarrassing when I went out to the club one night and I farted and felt the oil in my butt.Once you fart, the oil WILL come out. So yes, if you can help it, do not fart until you are ready to use the toilet. My problem is, I cannot wait until I get to a toilet to fart, so I know that this product is not for me.I've noticed that even when I eat a salad, I still would have the oily discharge, so I'm pretty sure it's inevitable to encounter.Word of advice though, when going out, where like a pad positioned to the back of your underwear or else you will mess up your underwear.Now, it seemed to have worked a bit for the one week that I was on it, but I also eat pretty healthy & exercise regularly, so it was a great add-on.It also did a great job of helping me feel full very quickly. But, there are definitely other weight loss pills that help that do not make you fart oil, so I'm planning on giving the rest of these pills to my sister and try something else.& word of advice, if you're married like I am, it sucks for your sex life. You'll be very cautious of farting before intercourse because you'll always have to wipe up all that oil on your butt! I think if I were single, this wouldn't be that big a deal."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've eaten Luna bars for years -- and love them. This price point made me want to order them online -- with the recurring feature. I wanted to cut down on the waste associated with mailing packages -- so tried to order 6 cases at a time, every six months (rather than a case every month). I even called and spoke to a sales associate. What happened? A few days later, a single case arrived in the mail... *sigh.* So the price and product were fine, but the service has a LONG way to go."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I used to spend lots of money buying meat and other items high in protein at the grocery store in order to get the necessary amount of protein for weight lifting. The problem with doing that is that for one you are spending a lot of money, and the second problem is that there is a lot of fat in meat. I have been using a 2 lb of this product for 1 month and I am already loving it and seeing results. I have blown away my old max in bench press! I love this stuff because it tastes good and has no fat! Also, if you're interested it seems like Optimum Nutrition thoroughly researches all of their products and tests them for quality assurance. That is something I can really respect about a supplement company."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,1.0,"The true ""original"" is the UK version, which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar. This product is the US version, which contains distilled white vinegar instead. I've compared both versions side by side and found that it's even possible to _smell_ the difference. As you may well imagine, the difference in taste is considerable.Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews. The US version no longer contains HFCS, but it's still not the ""original"" -- and it's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.Use the UK version (with the orange label) and accept no substitutes. Especially when they lie and claim to be ""original."""

She loves to eat rice puffs, and it's nice to be able to just let her have this dish when we're out and not have to worry about losing all the puffs. The only setback is that after a while, the lid becomes a little less effective at keeping snacks from spilling out when it's turned upside down. But it's still better than the alternative! I'd recommend having a couple of these for your little one."

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,"For such a simple electronic product, they are WAY over-charging their customers.The monitor I received is defective. I don't know if it's because the seller shipped it in a paper envelope from overseas (the sticks were completely squashed upon arrival) or because the product simply doesn't work. I also bought Ovuquick on the same day just to compare the results, Ovuquick works perfectly.I never understand why the ClearBlue Easy menu says if you hold it in a stream of urine, it will take 3 seconds. But if you submerge it in a cup of urine, it's 15 seconds. Should it be the other way around?I think the only good thing about this product (and why some people have successful results) is because it forces you to start testing on day 6. Sometimes I missed my ovulation day because I tested too late (day 10). But this has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Similar to many reviews - I started drinking this tea when I was 35 weeks pregnant. Drank for 2 weeks and the baby came a bit early - yet it was an amazingly easy and fast labor. It took me less than 30 minutes and I was fully dilated. I had to literally held the baby in so that my doctor could rush in to deliver him. LOL. And he was out in 3 pushes. Everyone was amazed how quick and smooth it was. I also had no tear. Like others said, I don't know for sure if it's really this tea, or genetics, or exercise (I did walk like at least 30 minutes a day), or luck or something else...but really, I can only see benefits of drinking this tea. I'll definitely drink again with my 2nd. Good luck everyone.Updated 11/11 - I recommended this tea to a close friend who drank 2 - 3 cups a day for 2 - 3 weeks before her labor. Her labor was not as smooth and fast as mine - it was about 15 hours total. Still it seems to be faster than other first time mothers I know who had labors of 24 hours or longer. I'm currently pregnant now (16 weeks) and will surely start to drink it around 32 weeks and will update this review after my labor."

Never seem to have the right size when you need it.My dog was injured and was sent home with these. I'd never seen them before and realized they'd work great on kids too.Surface is non stick meaning it doesn't stick to healing wounds so are easy to switch out. The pads are individually wrapped and are 4""x3"". The wrapping isn't waterproof, so put them in a zip lock for travel or hiking.It is handy to have a single size, no searching for the right size bandage. Have scissors (leatherman micra) handy to cut them to fit smaller wounds.The adhesive is only useful to hold the bandage in place while you are applying tape.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I absolutely adore these vitamins. Liked them so much I bought the child version for my son.Since I have been taking them I do not have the urge to drink coffee- of course the down side to that is fighting thru the ensuing withdrawal symptoms. Otherwise I feel great and maintain a steady energy level all day. The taste isn't all that pleasant sometimes but it's mostly a kinda vitaminy aftertaste and is hit or miss. Totally tolerable.I noticed no one mentioned the effect Source of Life has in the digestive tract
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,"I've been enjoying Illy medium roast at home but was looking to cut back on the caffeine. I ordered the decaf, but it's really bitter. I've made it a couple of times now, and it's always the same result. I'm using the same process as with the non-decaf - which comes out beautifully each time. If anyone has ideas, or can tell me I just got a bad batch (which, at this price is frustrating), that would help. I would really like to incorporate some decaf into my espresso drinking, especially in the evening."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"When I was in GNC once I compared the nutrition label on the GNC brand whey with the the Optimum Whey, and the Optimum was the healthier option. So I've stuck to buying Optimum over the years, and of course buying it on Amazon is always cheaper. I've found that the Strawberry and Chocolate flavor variations tend to be tastier than the vanilla. It seems like that one leaves more of an aftertaste too, but perhaps everyone's taste is different. I tend to buy the smaller sizes so I can change up the flavor more often."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"This is the best product. I stressed for months trying to figure out how I was going to keep my sons milk from going bad on long car rides or trips. I refused to continue to buy formula when my son no longer needed it and I was not going to go out of my way to buy small amounts of milk from a convenience store when it is needed. I saw this product and I figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did! I use tommy tippee bottles and they are wide and short and I wondered if two would even fit at one time, but they did! The only reason I gave 4 stars out of five is because after several weeks of using this I found that it doesn't stay cold the full 12 hours like it says. On average it will keep cold for about 7 or 8 hours, but I also left it in the hot car while out doing stuff and come back to grab a bottle hours later and they're still freezing cold! Definitely worth the money!"

It comes in at 150 calories per 2/3 cup serving compared with more for a 1/2 cup serving of poppycock.I personally prefer this more anyway. It has that somewhat salty flavor that is mostly sweet.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"I enjoyed this set to get episodes from multiple seasons. I enjoyed hearing the introductions from Barbara Hale and the director. On the negative side I wish there were a couple more episodes for the price and because I enjoy the show so much. $16.99 isn't a bad price considering how much some of the half seasons cost. There were only 12 episodes, the first movie ""The Return of Perry Mason"" from 1985 and a few extra on the 50th anniversary edition. They have included introductions with Barbara Hale which you can watch or not. I would recommend this if you are looking for a tape of the show that covers a few seasons, enjoyed the Perry Mason movies and one that isn't too expensive in my opinion."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My Mastiff was diagnosed with osteo-sarcoma in her wrist on May 10 2011. The Vet gave her 2 months to live. I immediately started her on this product after getting my vets OK. She is getting all the proper meds that come along with this diagnosis. Her quality of life is very good. She does walk with a bit of a limp. The vet tells me usually these cancers are very aggressive but it is slow growing in her. The last time he saw her he was very pleased. She weighs 125lbs. I give her 3 scoops in the morning and 3 at night with her food. I can't be 100% sure but I believe it is this product that is helping. Just bought some more and as long as she lives I will continue to give it to her everyday. This was a much better alternative than having her leg removed. THX
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"It irks me that local stores completely ignore tea drinkers. You can find more coffee than you can shake a stick at, but you can't find plain old black tea.Oh, you can find that orange and black pekoe mess---and I won't mention brands---but if you want a nice black tea without the twang (for lack of a better word), you're out of luck.Our local stores don't stock this tea (or any other plain old black tea). This is a great price, too.I use two of these tea bags in my keurig and it makes a nice cup of black tea (with the EZ-Cup). Steeping in the regular mode (about 3-5 minutes per bag/cup) makes a nice cup of tea, too.Price and availability considered, this is a steal of a deal."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"One of my favorite herbal teas isCelestial Seasonings Roastaroma, and one reason I like it is because it's about as full-bodied as an herbal tea can be. But I wanted something a bit sweeter and lighter to drink in the evening, including before bed and on occasion as an after dinner beverage, so I decided to try Yogi Tea Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut Tea. The first four ingredients of Roastaroma are roasted barley, roasted chicory, roasted carob, and cinnamon, and it is the chicory that gives Roastaroma it's coffee-like full-bodiedness, as chicory is often used as a coffee substitute. Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut does not have barley in it, but its first three ingredients are roasted chicory root, carob pod, and organic cinnamon bark, and I assume this accounts for why I consider it to be in a similar herbal tea category as Roastaroma. Some of the sweetness of Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut comes from stevia leaf. I'm drinking a cup now, sweetened with half a packet ofTruvia Natural Sweetenerand cooled with a dash of fat-free milk. Sometimes I sweeten it with a little raw sugar. And I find it delicious and satisfying, with a nice, mildly spicy aftertaste that I assume comes from the organic black pepper, clove bud, and organic ginger root that are among the ingredients of this fine tea.Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut also contains organic cardamom seed, and thus this tea contains the five traditional Ayurvedic spices, cardamom seed, cinnamon bark, clove bud, ginger root and black pepper, which were among the ingredients in the prototype ""Yogi Tea"" that Yogi Bhajan shared with his students after he arrived in America in 1969. (It wasn't until 1984 when the Yogi Tea Company that brings us Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut and other fine teas was formed.) One can get a sense of the care with which Yogi Teas are made by visiting their website and/or YouTube and watching the video of Yogi Tea's herbalist, Guru Hari Khalsa, explaining the Yogi Tea philosophy.I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of Tahitian Vanilla Hazenut tea bags through Amazon's easy to manage Subscribe & Save program on 9/25/11, and each box arrived with a ""best by"" date of June 2013 on it, which is a good long time from the time of purchase. (16 bags per box x 6 boxes = 96 cups of tea, a little over a 3-month supply for someone who drinks one cup a day.) One of the most satisfying herbal teas I've had, and I speak as someone who worked in the natural food industry before it was an industry and has been drinking herbal teas for 4 decades."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"So I've only been using it a couple of days so it is to early for me to notice anything... I'll probably edit this later with my ""results"" I'm just reviewing based on the taste. One reviewer said it tastes awful, I wouldn't listen to that review, he had to have gotten a bad one, or ordered the wrong kind, I just don't know. Taste is more important to me than results, because I have such a bad gag reflex that I can't even swallow pills, and I have a very sensitive palate. I wasn't even able to take prenatal vitamins when I was pregnant. Anyways ""unflavored"" really has no taste what-so-ever. The first time I drank it I skeptically mixed it with water as directed, and it had absolutely no taste, it is very grainy, it doesn't mix well with cold beverages. I'm now drinking it with my muscle milk light protein drinks with milk. I mix it really good, it is a little grainy, by about half way, I'm shaking with each drink, and it is completely dissolved and completely tasteless. I'm excited to see how this will work for me!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am a very cautious medicine taker (and supplements are medicine too). Sending anything that is not food down into my stomach has to be justified, absolutely necessary, well researched, etc... you get the idea. By the time our second child went into preschool, it seemed we were constantly getting sick or getting over being sick. We were picking up one bug after another from every sick child in their schools it seemed. That's when I found Wellness Formula at our local Wild Oats store (Wild Oats was bought by Whole Foods some years ago, but Whole Foods has continued to carry this product).First, the WARNINGS"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is REAL Irish tea. Many teas produced for this country are watered down for what is perceived as American taste. An example is Twinnings tea which has strong flavor and body when purchased within England but has a weak and insipid flavor even when purchased at a British airport. My father would have called it ""shamrock"" tea, meaning only three leaves were used in its making. Barrys has not followed that trend and this tea purchased in the U.S. is as flavorful as when purchased in Ireland. If you know tea (and having grown up in Ireland I do) Barrys fills the bill."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I purchased this product because I had read that Vitex has been documented to act on the pituitary gland to somewhat regulate hormone production for women. I'm 23, and over the past two years or so, my periods had become increasingly irregular (although stress from 16 months of nursing school will screw up any woman's cycle). I started taking this product in June 2011, after not having a period for 4 months and determining I was definitely not pregnant. I started taking 2 capsules per day as directed and reduced the dosage to 1 capsule per day after 2 months. After taking Vitex for 3 weeks I noticed some spotting, and soon enough, my period finally came two weeks later. My cycle has been 28 days ever since.Prior to taking Vitex, I had all the typical PMS symptoms (breast tenderness, mild cramping, cravings, irritability, etc). After I started taking it, the symptoms seemed to lessen in severity, although they are still present. I knocked a star off the rating though, since I noticed during one instance where my period was about to start that I had a severely painful episode of cramping to where I wanted to cry. I also noticed if you take Vitex with a meal, some pretty bad GI upset occurs. I would suggest taking this at least an hour before or after eating, to avoid any discomfort.Overall, I would suggest taking this product if you're looking for a natural remedy to help with your cycle."

My doctors had not been able to find anything that really helped me control the swelling and the all-but-inevitable leg ulcers that have been plaguing me for the past 20 years or so. I read about horse chestnut seed extract and its long-standing use in successfully treating this condition in Europe and decided to try it. My first order of Nature's Way Horse Chestnut, Standardized (sold by Nutricraze via Amazon) arrived about 3 weeks ago and I began taking it per directions the same day. I am happy to say that it began working immediately! In the course of the first 3 days I was taking it, the swelling in my lower calves decreased by at least half; and the over-all skin tone in both legs improved visably. Even better, two areas on one leg that had begun going into ulcers began to heal as well. I will definitely be reordering Nature's Way Horse Chestnut, Standardized on a regular basis from now on. Thanks Amazon for finding this for me!"

The first problem was that it didn't scoot under my kitchen table. The biggest issue for me though was the CHEAP FEEL of the whole thing. I know its only 50 bucks or so, but I would have paid maybe $75-$80 if it were better quality. The tray, seat, side rails, and basically the chair as a whole feels wobbly. The tray does not slide on and off easily due to this. The only benefit I could see with this chair is that its lightweight and could be brought to a restaurant, sitters, family members house for feedings. It would ravel well.We went with a full size Chicco. Its worth the extra 70 bucks!"

I had no pain or discomfort with this cycle. In fact my cycle has been very medium/light and I am normally heavy/clotty so I know it's working. I also have to add that I had a laparoscopy performed on Sept 29 and the Dr. said that my first cycle would be very heavy due to all the stage two endo and scar tissue/cyst removed. The Dr. also left a small fibroid, so even with a small fibroid my cycle is the best I have had in years!!! This stuff is amazing, I haven't gotten pregnant yet but will update when I do."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"By first soaking tapioca in 4 times as much room temperature water as tapioca (overnight for the large pearls and a couple hours for the small ones), then draining off the water and proceeding with your recipe you get tender tapioca in a reasonable amount of cooking time.

There are indeed other coconut water products out there that are similar, but Zico hits the sweet spot with price, size, and quality of product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Got the Tropical Punch flavor for the first time and to be honest the taste is horrid. It is basically the artificial bubblegum flavoring you find at the dentist when they use fluoride treatment (the only way I can describe it). I doubt whey drink mixes are ever going to taste ""good"" but this is definitely not tropical punch, I was imagining koolaid or something!. I would suggest sticking with the flavor you like or usually get. Other than that, the powder blends easy with a spoon and works better than other brands in my experience."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"The Optimum Standard Whey Protein definitely lived up to my expectations for quick whey protein. The taste is great, it actually does taste like French Vanilla Creme when you mix it with skim milk, and mixing it into a smoothie gives a wonderful sweet taste. I make a very simply smoothie from a banana, some vanilla extract, skim milk, and ice, and to me this protein complements it quite well. I will note that when mixing just with milk it clumps a little initially so it'll take some good shaking to get it well mixed if you're making the effort yourself. Overall I wasn't disappointed with this is protein powder and would recommend it to anyone who likes the vanilla flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I've been using this product for several years and it works great. My issue is with the price fluctuations that Amazon has. This is not the first time I've run into this issue and it's getting to the point where I'm going to stop ordering from Amazon altogether. I ordered this product in August and paid less than $15 per bottle for the 120 tablet size. I was really excited because I had been paying @ $20 elsewhere. I just went back to reorder and the price has increased up to almost $25 per bottle! Normally, Amazon is very accommodating when you contact them, but not in this case. They basically said ""Oh well"". Earlier this year, I bought a product and paid $12.99 for it. ONE MONTH later, I went to reorder and it was almost $35 for the same item! I understand price fluctuations, but this is ridiculous!"

health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"My 8 year old son started wetting the bed consistently at maybe 3 or 4 years old. He was a pretty dry kid at night before that. Nothing big changed in our lives, my husband's brother wet the bed until a pretty old age, or ped. just chalked it up to that. Well, both him and my 5 year old (another story altogether I guess) were both used to wearing underwear at night and I didn't have the heart (or frankly the money) to put them into pull-ups at night. Nothing against parents that use them, it just seemed to make them feel really badly when my husband and I discussed using them. This alarm works great. If you have it clipped in the right spot it senses the wetness when there is just a drop or two. I should probably read the directions again. We've had this alarm for over a year and this is the first time we've committed to use it every night. My son wakes up almost every night with it. The thing is, it wakes him up and he takes care of it himself. He goes to the bathroom and changes his underwear. Then he comes to me to help clip it back on. Probably 95% of the time, it's only his underwear that are a little wet. His pajamas and bed are dry. It's nice only having to wash one set (5 year old's) of sheets a night! BUT I'm not sure if this is helping get to the root of the problem or not. He doesn't seem to be waking up on his own yet. Sometimes he holds it all night though. It's probably been 8-10 weeks since we started using it. I just hope we can get past this and then start working with my other son (he'll be 6 in Dec. Also, just to make sure it detects the wetness right away, I clip it inside the ""flap"" area. Not sure what to call that but it seems to help that there's not an extra layer of fabric in the way. He's only wet really bad a few times, and out of those few times it's usually been when I was gone and he clipped it on himself. My husband thought he knew how to do it.Hope this helps....I do think the product itself does what it says. We've had no problems with the function of it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Over the years I have drank a lot of protein shakes starting with Met-Rx. Recently I tried a Syntha-6 to go and decided to order a container. I think this is one of the best tasting powders out there. I personally use one scoop of this and one scoop of ON Chocalate Whey in my post-workout shake. I'm sure this would be fine on it's own but I like to have the combination of proteins in the shake.I always mix with water and either a hand blender or a regualr blender and ice. I can't comment on it's ability to mix in a shaker bottle or with a spoon. I also signed up for repeat ordering so I saved an extra 15%. One of the local national retailers wanted $85 for the same size five pound container.

Your body does not feel weighed down after drinking this Whey Protein Isolate like some of the other supplements out there with a lot of artificial flavorings and extra additives. On another note, it is a little hard to drink by itself but dooable. To me it just taste like watered down milk but I almost never drink it in this fashion. I would recommend this product to a friend."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I was first offered this tea at a conference. I don't typically drink fruity teas but I was in a blueberry mood and decied to go with it. When you open the tea bag, the scent of blueberries is very noticeable. I prefer to avoid sweeteners (artificial and real) in my tea and this is a tea that is easily consumed without sugar or honey. It is simple and unfussy. The flavor notes are clear. I've since purchased this tea a few times and find it to be a great breakfast tea.The description on the tea bag indicates a ""delicate flavor"" and I would say that is an apt statement. The blueberry flavor is subtle but certainly present. As it is billed as a ""green tea with blueberry"", I didn't expect the blueberry flavoring to be much more than it is. If it had been marketed as just a blueberry tea, I would be disappointed. I don't think Bigelow makes this out to be more than what it is.This is a gluten- free product that is blended and packaged in the United States."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I'll start with the good. This flavor made me want to ""swallow my tongue"". I mixed a few drops in my bowl of vanilla ice cream. It took that bowl of vanilla to a higher level of bliss. The very next time I ate vanilla ice cream I used the 'other half' of the bottle. That's right, two doses and my butterscotch goodies were all gone. That brings me to my only complaint--1 dram is way too tiny,at $1.99 + $.99 for shipping and handling. The manufacturer should think about a larger quantity. I have therefore gone to another website and ordered a 2oz. bottle. Oh, yes, there is one other plus-- this is a flavoring and not a syrup. So you get flavor minus the extra sugar."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"PLEASE READ!!!! I hope people read this review before they buy!!! These pills actually work great. However, you should really only take about four pills a day. If you take the recommended dosage you will never leave the bathroom! I never take more than four pills a day and i skip a day at least once a week. Also, never take them on an empty stomach or they will make your stomach hurt. Always take them after meals. Follow this and they will work for you. They keep my system cleaned out and it's much easier for me to maintain a healthy weight. Feel free to ask me questions. BYE"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,4.0,"I bought this sauce, because I received some of his regular hot sauce in Iraq, in a care package. For anyone who loves hot sauce, daves is a good sauce, but it's a little pricey. I bought this to sample his other flavors, it's great on eggs, complements alot of meats as a dipping sauce. I would buy it again, but it's costly for a little bottle, with shipping. If you love you will buy more of it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"i used the fenugreek, and it didnt really work for me. i would recommend it to anyone breast feeding that needs to increase their supply. it doenst hurt to try. some people say that they smell like maple syrup, and i did a little, but not too much, and i like the smell of maple syrup."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,3.0,"I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again- just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,2.0,"The safety straps that were on the chair were of poor quality and not safe.The crotch strap was not sewn correctly and would not fit on the crossbar as intended.The latch mechanism, on the seat belt, is partially broken and will not stay snapped when child moves. Child could fall out of chair.I would hope that I get a response from the seller.Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Mahogany"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"More than doubling the retail price is hoggish. I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer. I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this. By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website. I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up..."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,When I was a kid I loved Dunkaroos. After finding out Amazon sold them I was thrilled. Dunkaroos is the greatest cinnamon-vanilla treat when you are on the go!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have used real maple syrup for years. When my kids were small I used the standard stuff until I started becoming a label reader, then I could not in good conscience continue to serve a product that amounted to a liquid chemical concoction. I recently discovered grade B syrup, which has a stronger, more molassas kind of flavor. Besides the obvious pancakes and french toast, I also use it on oatmeal and in baked goods. Will continue to purchase."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,I've only tried 2 flavors. Vanilla and Banana. I love the vanilla between the two flavors. Banana taste like crap. The banana on Muscle Milk taste way better. The only problem I have with this product is that it doesn't mix very well. This protein powder definitely taste alot better with milk than water.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,love this tea and it is a very good deal. I'd say by it an you won't go wrong! If you want the best deal I found it is here
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,I bought this Munchikin bottle brush for cleaning my Clear20 water filtration pitcher. Before I change the filter each time I clean out the pitcher with this brush. It works great. What I like about this brush is the suction cup that keeps it standing upright and therefore keeps it cleaner. Only recently did I twist off the suction cup and realized there was another brush attached. Very clever!~The Rebecca Review
baby products,feeding,unknown,2.0,"If you bought this for some other reason than to help with round ligament pain due to pregnancy, skip to the next review. I bought this belt because I began suffering significant round ligament pain, to the point that walking was extremely painful, around 20 weeks of pregnancy. In particular, for me, it seems to be severely exacerbated by jogging or running.I purchased this belt after surfing around Amazon looking at the various maternity belt options. This one is definitely one of the smallest options of the bunch, and also one of the cheapest. Unfortunately, after trying it out for a few days, I really don't think it's helped me at all. The round ligament pain is as bad as ever. Perhaps it would be worse without the belt as my pregnancy is progressing - who knows.The belt itself is well-made and easy to put on. I am 22 weeks pregnant and 140 lbs or so currently, and I found the size Small fits on the smallest setting."
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"It worked to calm the athletes foot, the itching but it does not go away completely. Definitely did help, it helped make my feet smoother and not crack."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Very clean and easy to steep into tea. Grate aroma and very effective in making a person relaxed and sleepy. Also reasonably priced.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This is a quality product that provides exactly what the description says. I found the taste acceptable and the price is indeed exceptional. My only real disappointment with the product was with the mixing. It does not stir well so you really need to shake with water. However, you need to do this just a SMALL amount of water first and then once the powder has mixed in then you can carefully add more water along the side of the container so that you avoid the excessive amounts of foam that form if you just shake with the desired amount of water.I am currently trying several brands. If I don't find another that I like as well then I would definately buy this again."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday. The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works. It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course. My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"very satisfied with the product exceeded my expectations as to what I expected, I recommend it to all who wish to purchase such products"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I drink this for breakfast and it's amazing. It fills me up until I eat lunch. I divide the package into 2 severing as the package is way to thick for my liking. Dividing it into 2 servings makes the purchase last a lot longer. I highly recommend it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,First time trying product. Mixes reasonably well for a green powder and ok if you put it in juice. Couldn't handle it in water.
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"I like the product, it's easy to take and very effective. Since tryptophan is an essential building block of serotonin and not a serotonin supplement it allows a natural and seamless delivery. Interestingly it also goes well with the bodies natural schedule, meaning, during the day it gives you a boost and in the evening it helps you wind down and have a peaceful sleep. In short it's a great product that I would recommend, take as directed and you'll get a positive outcome. On a side note, I actually bought this product to help me manage OCD which can be caused in part by a lack of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter without it the brain can get ""stuck"" in certain states thus creating compulsive and hyperactive behavior. Lack of serotonin is also associated with depression in it's various forms, also a struggle for me. So finding a natural aid has been a blessing."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have been using this bread for years. Although I don't like to have to bake it (lazy), it's worth the work. My friends like it, and they don't have a gluten problem. I do two things that I think make it better... include white raisins (not brown) and toast my slices after they are 1 day old. Yes, the white raisins even taste good on a ham sandwich. Sounds weird, but you'll see."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Bought this for my grand daughter, she loves it! Easy clean up in the dishwasher. Great product for introducing new foods to your child."
baby products,feeding,pacifiers accessories,5.0,"These latex (brown material) nuks are our baby's preferred pacifier, and they've become very difficult to find in local stores. It seems everyone is switching over to the clear silicone, but my baby just doesn't like that material. The price is great! The only potential drawback for others might be the assorted colors. I ordered 2 and received a white and a purple, just fine for my baby girl. Love this Nuk and the peace it provides!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,4.0,"I was super excited to find my beans in the mail today, I placed my order on Sunday and they shipped on Monday. I was however a bit disappointed when there were only 43 beans in the package. I was truly hoping to get closer to the approx 54 they state. The beans were very aromatic and to me they seemed quite nice. I have never dealt with vanilla beans before so I guess my comparison is quite limited :) I am using them to make my own Pure Vanilla for baking so I guess I will find out in 6 mos how it turns out. Nice buy but disappointed in how many I received.ETA"

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,I enjoy the versatility of this chair. It is adjustable so that we can utilize the chair as he grows. I love that the trays can be sanitized in the dishwasher. It cleans up easily. I wish that the center piece between his legs came up a little higher and would have liked the back to be a little thicker material. I read the review and was happy that I picked this booster seat.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Hot cereal is the best oatmeal ever. It is easy to cook, on the stove or microwave. But best of all, is the taste it is yummy and good for you. Excellent product."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I've used Clemestine Fumarate for many years for my allergies, especially in the fall when my allergies are at its height. This is a very good tablet that will stop all your sneezing, itching, watery eyes and runny nose. It is much cheaper than the expensive Zyrtec. It is much more effective than that overrated Claritin.Too bad it is hard to find. I think that it is hard to find because for 12 hours of relief Clemisine gives, it is very cheap compared to Allegra and Zyrtec even though Allegra and Zyrtec relief last 24 hours. You can get 100 tablets for less than 20 dollars when you only get about 12-20 tablets of Zyrtec or Allegra for the same price. The pharmaceutical companies don't want you to know that. Hence they make sure local brick and mortar drug stores don't sell it.For allergy suffers such as myself, I highly recommend this product."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"My boyfriend and I are work-a-holics. We truly believe in work hard and play harder, however sometimes we (me more-so then him), have a hard time turning our brains off. We take a pill at night, and it doesn't make us feel like we're zombies. It makes us feel"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,I bought this product after I saw an ad on TV saying that it will help with digestion by adding additional bacteria in the intestines. The ad claimed that this product is 10 times better than yogurt. I have used this product for almost 2 months now and I can say I don't have any negative thing to say about it. I can also say I didn't notice much of a difference in my digestion. I still feel acidity and heartburn in the back of my throat after meals sometimes. I thought that product will help me overcome this problem. I decided to stop ordering after the 2nd month of use.. I can not recommend this product but maybe that's just me. You can try it for yourself and see.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I love this mix for pancakes the best. The recipes on the back of the bag have all worked out well!
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"Exactly like Annie who just posted a review, I bought one of these in 2010, loved it, then lost it this year (still in excellent condition). I replaced it in June 2011. Unlike my first one, the lining of the new one has already loosened significantly and will soon completely separate, just as others have described. I still use it because IT WORKS. I will replace it and hope they will resume their previous quality. Otherwise, a few dollars a month is worth it for the comfort and longer sleep.For meditation (and best light blockage but slightly less comfort for side sleeping) I have used a Mindfold for over 30 years - no affiliation. I really love this and keep several in case they're ever discontinued.Mind Fold Relaxation Mask"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Silky sweet and savory. The best balsamic I have found for under $100. This is THE stuff. So much better than even the pricey stuff you may find in your average store. Highly recommended.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"I expected more from the Samhadi Pro line with these sheets.They are not a bad sheet, but they are not much better (if at all) than good quality flannel sheets bought at a department store.I washed in cold water, used the auto-sense dry option on the dryer, and they shrunk somewhat, but nothing drastic or unexpected.However, they are too small to start with in my opinion.Save yourself some money and go buy a regular set of twin sheets, then buy extra face cradle covers.I hope Earthlite gets their act together on this one and revamps this product."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have been using Wonder Labs Valerin for several years. While I have used a prescription product for muscle cramps, I prefer a natural remedy that can safely be used more frequently. Valerin is fantastic for cramps, stress, tension and muscle relaxation. The natural tablets do have a distinct odor, but I haven't experience any side effects in over four years of use. It is a life saver. Wonder Labs manufacturers this product under strict conditions. The tablets relax your tension and leave you feeling better. I recommend this product highly. Wonder Labs even has a great guarantee, if you order the 340 tablet set (one bottle of 250 and one of 90), you can try the 90 tablet bottle and if you don't like it, return the 250 for a refund. No one I have recommended this to has because they find it beneficial. I hope you will too. It is well worth it!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I decided to try this product with a fair amount of skepticism, as my experience with such ""natural"" remedy claims in the past have been disappointing. However, to my amazement, after 4 weeks on Estroven Maximum Strength, almost like magic, the hot flashes were minimally occurring and much milder, then after several more days they became almost non-existent. I also slept much better and had more energy. As a long-time headache sufferer, another huge bonus for me was a significant decrease in the frequency of headaches. My initial thought was ""I will make sure that I don't run out of this and would recommend it highly"" to any woman suffering with menopausal symptoms of any kind. Sadly, I have to ammend this. No sooner had I spent another $25 and submitted my glowing review of this product, did it begin to quit working. The hot flashes returned, mild and infrequent at first, then right back to square one. Insomnia, daily headaches, and no energy. Save your money- unless it's worth $25 to you for a for only a few weeks of relief."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,5.0,"These ""chips"" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,5.0,"The organic Macaroni and Cheese from Kraft makes fast dinners a snap. I have a 4- and 7-year-old and they love it! I will usually prepare it with plain non-fat Greek yogurt, which adds protein and calcium, and the kids love it more. They even ask for it to be prepared ""with the yogurt!"" Whatever is left-over, they have no problems eating it in their school lunches the next day. I am happy to be giving them an all-time favorite (that even we loved as kids) in an organic fashion...way to go Kraft for doing that for us and the planet."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,I've used these pregnancy tests with each of my pregnancies. I've used them for the last 4 years for 4 different pregnancies and have never had an issue. No need to buy the expensive store brand to double check just because these are cheap either. Great product!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"I purchased this product per the advice of my acupuncturist. He said it provides long lasting moist heat to the affected area. Even with following the directions, I found that the heat does not last more than 10-15 minutes. It is also a chore to heat up as you need to heat it up in water in a pan on the stove each time you use it. I much prefer the rice packs that you can stick in the microwave. Will probably use it, but would not purchase again."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,ordered these insoles after reading all the reviews and also because of a recommendation from my doctor. they add an additional level of comfort when walking. took out the original insoles from my shoes and used them as a pattern to make an exact copy and fit for the Spenco insoles. definitely a good purchase.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have tried all the the bars from the same brand, this one is my favorite. It tastes really good. Not too sweet; very balanced. And the ingredients are great! No junk in it. I strongly recommend this bar."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have had a really terrible immune system in the past, and I normally get sick several times a cold/flu season, last year I was sick the ENTIRE month of December with a cold, then bronchitis, almost to the point of pneumonia. I started taking these because I have an in home child care now, and I really can't AFFORD to get sick. I cannot tell you how this nips the sickness right in the bud. I am so convinced that I have begun taking 2 tablets a day so I just don't even get the inkling of being sick. I begun having cold/flu symptoms last Friday, tired, achy, freezing cold and shivery, and I downed six of these. Within three hours I had terrible garlic breath, but lost the foggy, achy, chilled feeling and felt at 100%. I really believe these played a huge part in that. This is a great value, and less than half the price of Whole Foods. I subscribed so my husband can start taking them too. Excited about my new immune system!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,This coffee is so bitter. I have used 6 packets of sweetener and it is still bitter. It so smells good but the taste is what really counts.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I was pleased to get two bottles for the price of one; I use Cherry Tart to help with pain. It is some help and this price was great.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"If like me, you were looking for chips that are actually hot as the label says, these are the chips for you. They are tongue burning, sinus clearing, eyes watering hot if you eat more than a few chips. Also they have a nice hint of barbecue chip flavor, and that good crunch of kettle chips.They are enjoyable to eat, and not just for the novelty of eating the hottest chip you can find.I bought the case and shared a few bags with other lovers of hot foods."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Count me in! Great packaging and good quality, exactly what I needed for my workouts. I've noticed significant results since adding a 40g protein and 90g of this shake to my post-lifting routine."
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I have been using this pillow for about 6 weeks and I think it's great. I can't say if it flattens out but my baby is BIG (2 months and already 14.5 pounds) and he sleeps on it all day and I haven't noticed a change in shape. I find it super comfortable and I can put my baby on it and he can nurse and sleep all day while I do other things (read, watch TV, work on my computer whatever). It also has a lot of different purposes...he likes to sit in it, propped up against it in different positions...I would say it's also comfortable to sit on post-pregnancy if your bottom is in pain. I would definitely say that even if you don't LOVE it it is still one of those products that you will definitely use."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,pretzels,5.0,"I buy these as often as I can at my supermarket, as they usually sell out ridiculously fast. If SoH sold the honey mustard they coated these pretzels in, they'd make so much money they wouldn't know what to do with it. These honey mustard pretzels are really that good. My only problem is that once I open the bag, all the pretzels are gone (I inhale them). Damn them for being so tasty!And finding them on Amazon is a steal, as these sell for $3 plus; you can just subscribe and save, and then oh-so-slyly, unsubscribe. You save $9 doing this, rather than buying 12 of these at $3 a pop at the supermarket. That makes this snack all the more satisfying. &lt;3"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,1.0,"I've yet to find a truly tasty low carb cereal. At best these are tasteless and overly hard (too crunchy and dry).They smell a bit like sawdust and probably taste no better.I love that they are loaded with protein, unfortunately I found them barely edible."
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,5.0,"I am so happy to have found these on Amazon! I used to buy them in a local store, but they stopped carrying them, and I have not been able to find them since. I have breathing issues (go figure, with the smoking, right?) Anyway, when I am able to use these, they help my breathing so much! Also cuts down on any coughing I do. It's actually kind of gross when you see the amount of tar that collects in the filters. To think, that's what I am usually breathing in. But for anybody who has tried to stop smoking but can't, or anyone who just doesn't want to quit, these are a great tool to help limit some of the nasty stuff we're breathing in. I absolutely recommend this product for anyone who smokes cigarettes. I will add as a sidenote, if you smoke the ""skinny"" cigarettes, they will fall right out of the filter. The end is made to hold an averaged-sized cigarette."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"So far so good with this whey protein. The price is decent, but even more importantly for my purposes, they have plain--unflavored, unsweetened. I don't want any artificial sweeteners and flavors, and I don't find the natural tatse of whey protein terribly objectionable. I add a little malted milk to help flavor it to my liking. Just as important for me regarding this brand is the source"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,These protein bars are the yummiest bars I've ever tasted. They are great as a meal replacement and certainly fill you up fast.

Then I adopted a cat, and bought another one of these Pet Massagers...it's the best...it's certainly helped to make her feel at home..this is home, and I am her personal servant....who massages her with this thing. All I do is click the button to turn it on, and I got cat in my lap! I don't care where in this place she is..even if she's sleeping...she hears that button click, here she comes....It's the best!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,5.0,"After a year of trying to get pregnant, my husband was diagnosed with low sperm count (2 mill) and low motility. I did some research and found this product and figured it was worth a shot. My husband started seeing a urologist and was diagnosed with a varicocele. We told the urologist that my husband was taking fertility blend and he told us he wasn't too familiar with it, but anything my husband did would take 72 days to have an effect on his sperm. The urologist wanted my husband to be retested in three months to see if there was any improvement in his sperm count and if there wasn't he'd have to look into getting surgery to remove the varicocele. My doctor was telling me if we couldn't get an improvement, we would have to go the in vitro route since other fertility treatment would likely be ineffective in our case. Well one week before my husband was supposed to go in to be retested, we found out I was PREGNANT!!! This was my first cycle after the 72 days. I am now just over 6 weeks pregnant and we saw and heard our baby's heartbeat for the first time a couple days ago.My husband started off by taking 4 pills a day (as instructed on the bottle) for the first month and then 2 pills a day after that. I'm convinced these pills made all the difference and highly recommend them. It was other reviews like this that made me give this product a try, so I wanted pay it forward and hope others give this product a try and are also successful. Just remember it will likely take at least 3 months to see a difference."

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,4.0,"The 4 ounce Inka Plantain Chips countains 4 servings of 140 calories each (60 calories from fat). Sodium 60 mg., Potassium 220 mg, Total Fat 6g (9%), Saturated Fat 2.5 g (13%), 0 Trans Fat, Carbohydrates 20g (0 sugar), Protein 1g, Fiber 1g, Vitamin A (6%), Vitamin C (15%). The good news about the fat is that it is a plant based saturated short chain fatty acid, so your body can digest it efficiently.For anyone who isn't familiar with plantain, it is an Asian fruit, which like it's cousin, the banana, was introduced to the new world by 15th and 16th century explorers, such as the Portuguese and Spanish sailors, so calling them Inka Chips is interesting. For more than a year, I was looking for a good gluten-free cracker and I never considered a plantain chip as an excellent substitute until now, and shame on me, because I discovered them about twenty years ago. As a matter of fact, instead of making dumplings out of wheat flour, Puerto Ricans make them out of ground green plantains or bananas. I never ate plantain chips as a kid, but I did enjoy the plantain dumplings in soup; they were delicious and low in fat. Puerto Ricans also combine the ground plantain with other tropical tubers and stewed meats to make a huge dumpling that they boil in parchment paper in order to keep it intact while it cooks in a light brine; it's delicious and filling. At the West Indian markets in NYC, they sell plantain, banana, casava, and peanut flour. So, if you like to cook and experiment, you may want to make dumplings from such flours; I'm not a cook.The Inka chips are thicker than the plantain chips that I ate years ago, making them a suitable cracker substitute. I cover them with peanut butter or fruit preserves and enjoy them as a snack. I also crush them and add them to my bowl of soup in order to give the soup a nice crunch; these chips hold up well in liquid, better than Saltine crackers, with less salt."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is our second order on this product. It has been beneficial to me and my wife to keep us going and able to do all the things we want to do and places to go.In fact, we have a standing order to ship every other month."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,cereal,5.0,My 1yo loves these and I like them two. They are tasty. The peach and the sweet potato ones are great
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,The most effective product I have found for arthritis pain as well as muscle ache. I liked it so well I purchased some to send to certain family members I knew could benefit from using the Sombra Warm Therapy. I will not be without it again.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"I really like Oskri and coconut, so I bought these bars. Not what I was expecting. It is what it is"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"I'm replacing a heating pad that's at least a decade old that got nice and hot. This one is lukewarm! On high (I preheated it for a half hour to be sure) it's kind of warm against my bare skin but no way would it feel warm enough through clothing. Which is completely useless. I know there are restrictions, but this is pathetic!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,It tastes good. Tea bags are individually packed. White tea is a good source of antioxidents. My friends like the tea too.
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"I was very exited when ordered this set. I got it today and I didn't use them yet. very good for the price. but set that I've got, consists of only dark colors (not as shown in the picture) boring colors, only blue and green, and violet. I wish if I get even one yellow or red but... :("
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I found Canker Cover to be a very effective product at reducing the duration of canker sores. Left untreated, my sores persist for over three weeks; with these patches they are gone within a week. The patch is a small tablet, white on one side and orange on the other, but a few hours after applying it, it absorbs water and expands into a blob of jelly 10 times its original size. This jelly protects the sore and allows it to heal. I've found that applying the patch at night is most effective, as during the day it tends to wear off due to normal talking / eating, plus it looks kind of unsightly. The jelly itself is tasteless but leaves a strange sensation in the mouth, so it does take some getting used to. However, the bottom line is that it reduces the duration of my canker sore for 2 weeks or more, so I'm very happy with it!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,soft drinks,5.0,"This was a favorite for us New York dieters. Add skim milk and you have a brooklyn chocolate egg cream! Well not exactly,but it fills the bill. Could not find it in Las Vegas the last five years, and with free super saver shipping, it was a steal."
health personal care,health care,stimulants,1.0,"Very bad first impression...I haven't tried them yet, I took off the plastic that covers it, then I open the cap, the seal for your protection was open it is obvious that someone opened the pills and went through them, also there was no cotton inside, usually most do, and i counted all the pills myself in case there was any missing. This looks like a scam already...Also the Supplement Facts, 1350 mg per bottle as you can see above on the picture advertised. I received it, it was exactly the same, i thought they probably made an error on the picture above. I was like WTF it has all these ingredients but how MUCH of IT. So i came to a conclusion that it doesn't have none of the ingredients it state. DONT BUY IT, Im going to try them and if I notice any changes ill write another review, BUT so far not worth it!!! All the good reviews are more likely written by the seller himself or his friends so they can fool people."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I bake cakes and this is the ONLY filling I do not attempt to make myself because it is so delicious and so easy to use that there is no point in trying to duplicate it! The case price is great, much more of a deal than buying individual cans at the grocery store. I will continue to buy this product for years to come. Most importantly, my cake customers love it too."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"There's not a whole load to say. It has worked well for me so far in keeping my emotions stable. I feel like I'm almost a new person. For those who've never taken St. John's Wort before, it can take a few weeks before you start feeling the effects, and possibly more than a month before it'sworking 100%, so don't give up when you don't notice any immediate changes."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I love to cook and watch all the cooking shows on cable tv. One cook is from England and she used this in a recipe and just raved about it so much I had to try it. I'm glad I did, it has a more buttery taste to it. I love it and will continue to purchase it. I apologize that I didn't say so sooner. Sincerely, Kelly M"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"The refill oil has a nice and fresh scent. It is not overpowering. I don't know why ""Milk"" is it's product name. I really didn't smell any ""milk""."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Really Like this, and it dissolves well in a shaker bottle with no problems for me. Great price on the 5lb and great taste, I mix it with unsweetened Almond milk (35 calories) and taste just like a Choc. Milk shake. Very pleased."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"Before buying the Spenco insoles, I had bought some $10.00 Dr.Scholls foot insoles about a month ago. The heel part had a harder gel area to help cushion the feet. Well after a few weeks of wearing them, my heals started sharply aching as I walked even after I took my shoes off. Since removing the Dr. Scholls about a week ago and replacing my shoes with the Spenco insoles, my feet are almost feeling fine again. I stay on my feet at work about 10 hours a day. Much of the floor is concrete and I have found the Spenco insoles to be very comfortable all day long. I bought 8 pairs of these at a great price on Amazon and should be set for a while."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I bought 5 different protein bars from Amazon at one time to test them. This was the worst tasting. I bought it for my husband and he calls this the ""OSB"" one. I think it had good stuff in it and definitely had a lot of protein, but we didn't care for the taste."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,4.0,for discreet male bladder protection. Since making this purchase I have found another brand which I prefer over Tena that I can purchase in large quantities so I do not have to worry about having to purchase these frequently.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"The price and everything is fine, and it's not a bad product, but it seems falsely advertised. It's really foul tasting, I mix it with unsweetened chocolate almond milk. It barely mixes with a shaker, still clumps kind of bad, but I usually drink it really fast in the morning for breakfast anyway.It tastes really awful. The stevia extract or whatever they use leaves the same sort of filmy taste in my mouth that artificial sweeteners leave, which is a pity. Had I known what it tasted like ahead of time, I would have just stuck with what I was using. I'll go through what I have, but I won't be buying it again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"First of all, I NEVER write reviews on products. But after using this I feel compelled to write one.I have suffered from chronic UTI's for a few years now. Just recently they got much worse and I have been getting them on a bi-monthly basis. It's been horrible. I started feeling horrible while taking the anti-biotics and now my infections have become resistant to cipro. I had tried taking D-mannose before, but I was taking a different brand that was mixed with cranberry. I didnt have much luck. After becoming desperate for something to help I did a search online and came back to D-mannose.I found this product on Amazon and started reading the reviews. I decided to try it. This stuff WORKS!!!!I take it daily (1 tsp. each morning and night) to prevent infections.This morning I felt an infection coming on. I had the pain and urgency. I usedRapid Response 10 Parameter (10SG) Urinalysis Reagent Test Strips, 100 Strips/Bottleto test my urine and sure enough it showed positive for leukocytes. I increased my dosage to 2 and 1/2 tsp every 3 hours (5 grams) and within about an hour of taking my first dose the pain and urgency was gone. Tonight when I re-tested my leukocyte level was barely detectable. I was VERY impressed.I would reccommend it for people who have any issues with UTI's and don't want to take anti-biotics.I have heard that taking cranberry can actually be a bad thing for people with UTI's so I have stopped taking it and now just take the D-mannose.The price is amazing. The first time I bought it was at whole foods and it cost $29 for a bottle the same size. So the price on here is a great savings!FYI"
baby products,feeding,pillows stools,5.0,"I could not function without my boppy. Son loves cuddling with me on it, also likes lounging, propped up in it, we use it for tummy time and for nursing it is a must. This pattern is really cute. Its great for little boys or girls. Buy extra covers though!!! And a plain ""protector"" cover that boppy sells. They are waterproof and you put them under the fancy slipcover. Otherwise plan on washing the actual pillow all the time. These things get pooed on, leaked on, spit up on....you get the idea. :)"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I remember buying dunkaroos back in the 90's then suddenly they disappeared for a long time. I am glad to see that they are back, albeit limited! They taste EXACTLY the same. I am guilty of stocking up a bit on these now. I just wish the chocolate frosting were available through subscribe and save also. AND the cookies and cream variety. LOVED those so much too! At this point the vanilla frosting and sprinkles are the only affordable choice, and i have not seen the cookies and cream at all since about 1998 i believe. The chocolate frosting are available, but not worth the money where I've seen them. GET THESE NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN. YUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYY"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I've been searching high and low for a green-tea scented candle. I have found a lot of ""green tea/citrus"" and scents like that, but not just simply ""green tea"". So when I found this one, I bought it right away. None of the other reviews I read, even negative ones, seemed to mention Beanpod candles smelling gross. So I bought it. Candles cost too much as it is, but when I spend 20 bucks and then get something like this, I'm very disappointed.It did not smell like green tea in the slightest. The best I can come up with to describe the smell (which I could smell before even opening my package when it came in the mail), was some cross between AXE Body Spray and campground latrine disinfectant. It stung the nostrils. Just awful. I don't know how anyone could find this scent enjoyable, let alone claim that it smells anything like green tea."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Just like the old days. I've loved PR for years. Found this product in a store by the same manuf. It was on sale, once, at 3/$6. Next time it was $3 each. I paid $11.88 for the case of 12 less than a month ago and see the price is now nearly 50% more. Still, all in all a good bargain, even now, at about $1.40 ea."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"this really wasnt worth the little bit i spent on it, it cut off when rubbing against temples. The attachments arent very soothing either............. not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,3.0,I had abdonminal surgery at the time 4 weeks post-op. I loved the compression and that this was not so bulky. By week 2 I had a rash and itched like crazy.I used some hydrocortisone and it went away after 2-3 days . I started usinging it again right after and broke out 3 days later. I would wear it all day at work 8 hrs. I'm not sure what made me break out but when I cut off a strip to put it on my scar and held it down with my medical binder or my underwear I never broke out. I may wear it now only if I'm wearing something a bit more form fitting. It stays in place and you never have to pull it up or down like the compression garments you get from the doc.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I was one of the few reviewers who did not really like the orange flavor of Coromega's fish oil, so I thought I would try this lemon/lime flavor...Bad idea! The taste is so awful. Like old, stale, lime skittles soaked in vinegar. Won't buy this flavor again!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"Great product line, constant superior grains and packaging. Subscribe and save is perfect for those products(especially Red Mill)that you use all year along at approximately the same rate. Great time saver."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love Avent because their wide bottles are okay for breastfed babies. My baby is mixed fed, breastfed after office hours and formula fed when I'm at work. Anyways, the nipples are well made but I made the mistake of getting the fast flow one for my 6 month old, well, it is FAST and she had a hard time keeping up with the flow so I your baby is breast/mixed fed, use the fast flow around 1 year of age."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is the best herbal tea. If you want regular black tea but don't do caffeine, this stuff tastes just like it - AMAZING!!! Had to get an extra shipment because we went through it so quickly. Speaking of quickly, the shipping time is the fastest I've experienced. These people are on top of it. Keep it coming......thanks."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Love this product. Not just for pancakes! So far I have made pancakes, waffles, cookies and biscuits. Whether you need a gluten free diet or not this product produces yummy treats."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Product worked for me. A suggestion you may need to try three or four daily until pills are in your system. Then downgrade to two pills daily.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is my favorite seasonal flavor, unfortunately I think it has been discontinued. All these people crabbing they aren't snacks, I'm a distance runner and I eat these for breakfast. If I ate these while running I'd probably vomit. It's a quick source of nutrition when you have a hummingbird-like metabolism that forces you to pack snacks just to go shopping. Must eat, NOW!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,2.0,"I'm going to buck the trend of reviews here. I have eyed these at Whole Foods before. We frequently make hummus and fried chick peas (yum!), and when I saw a good deal on a case, after reading all the great reviews, I thought I would give these a try. I was particularly impressed to learn that the can was BPA free.Usually, I enjoy snacking on chickpeas right out of the can as we are preparing our recipes. I popped one into my mouth, and was underwhelmed. The second one, I thought maybe I just need to get used to them. The third was as bland as the first two. We ended up adding lots of seasoning to give these any flavor at all.My husband teases me occasionally about using up the remaining cans.Maybe I am just not the target audience for this product. Mine is strictly and clearly the opinion of someone who does not look for low sodium products. I am sure these are great for others (as indicated by other reviews), but I wanted to give the review of someone who does not regularly eat foods without any salt - I wish I had read one before I purchased these. if you are not used to no-salt added products, like me, these may be to bland for you too. As for me, I will save some coin and stick with the Goya brand (recommended by Cooks Illustrated), when I have finally used up all of these."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"We have been using this set since my daughter was 6-months. The cups are easy to drink out of and don't spill too much. There's some liquid that comes out if you shake them, but not too much. I like that the spouts are hard so they can't really be used while teething to chew on. It also teaches more how to drink properly than the soft sippy spouts that are more bottle-like. The bowls and tops secure nicely and are great for storing infant and toddler portions of food. The silverware is great for little hands. I definitely recommend this set."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"We tried samplers from many brands and we finally settled on the Lavazza Gran Crema.The taste is smooth, not too bitter, perfect for our morning latte! We have a Rancilio espresso machine, and the results have been consistent. The pod produce a nice crema and the same taste everytime.The pods come loose in a big cardboard box, so it's not as fancy as some of the other brands (e.g. the nicely packaged Illy or Starbucks), but they are much cheaper, so it's worth it for me."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Years ago this was recommended to me by a coworker when I worked outside at a local market. I had a terrible cold and she suggested I go buy this. I have used it ever since (that was 1997). At the first sign of a cold of any kind or flu like feelings, I take the recommended amount (six capsules- 3 times a day for several days) and drink lots of water and try to get as much sleep as possible. I also take 2 capsules a day during the winter cold/flu months. While everyone else has a cold that lasts for weeks, mine is gone in days. Try this stuff! It has worked very well for me over the years."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I used the product as directed on a trans-Atlantic trip, both directions. I don't know how I would have felt if I had not taken the product, but unfortunately, for me, it wasn't the silver bullet many have said it was for them. I have had uneven experiences with homeopathic products, some worked for me, some didn't. It was worth a try for me. Since everyone reacts to such products differently, I am not giving it the poorest rating. It may be worth a try for you."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,I'm very satisfied with this product. It's the third time I by it and Iwant to continue. I thnik that is one of the bests Vitamin C I know.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been using this product, on and off, for about 2 months, and to me, itsgood for extra energy. Plus it provides free- radical protection from plant-derived sources.You can get a decent price/cost if you look around at different sites."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,rice cakes,5.0,"I am allergic to wheat and am limited to what I can eat. Ry Krisps are the first wheat free crackers I found and to date remain my favorite. The taste for all of the Ry Krisps I have tried are better than Ry Vita and Wasa crisp breads. Perhaps it is the caraway seeds or the texture. Unfortunately, Bremmer foods bought the maker Ry Krisp and raised the price. If you go the manufacturer's website, the price is much lower than Amazon, but the shipping cost is outrageous. Sadly I now have to buy RyVita which is much more reasonable in cost."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have used a few vitamin B liquids. Usually they taste awful. This is sweetened with Stevia and is rounded out with nice compliment of B complex vitamins and precursors. I really like this product.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"These bottles work great, I used them for bothe my kids which are 7 years apart and loved them both times. Definitely check the date on these reviews!! I noticed all the bad ones are Very Old! They must have fixed somthing. The slow nipple is NOT too slow, my daughter is 6 months old and these are the ONLY nipples I have found that are slow enough for her, anything else and she finishes a bottle within 2 minutes. I really just love these bottles for the nipples, I have bought a couple of the $1 bottles from walmart and those work just as good, but I use the nipples from these most of the time."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After a bout with Diverticulosis, I am taking this to help feed the good germs in my intestines. Too early to call the results."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I used Cytomax for about a month and didn't like it. It gets great reviews from the majority of people that use it & I beleive most of them are cyclists & long-distance runners. I play hockey, do interval sprinting, & weight training so I thought it would be good for me. I guess it was okay, but I find for my type of training that Gatorade G-2 PRO Series works better. I do NOT use the pre-workout or the post-workout G-2 PRO Series, I use just the ""Perform"" which is for during the workouts. I have other supplements that I use for pre & post workout. The Seller, Shipping & Price Get 5 STARS *****. The product, for me particularly & my experience gets 2 Stars."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I drink the protein with milk every time after I came back from the gym. After using this protein for one month, I found my muscles were growing. The chocolate flavor is acceptable for me"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"So healthy and good for you, and it tastes great. I know that's a personal view, but this is my favorite of all the coconut waters I have tried. No added sugar, and so not too sweet.The pack of six x 33.8oz cartons are great value too."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"the heating pad just does not get hot enough. I do like the shape and stitching, it doesn't get wrinkled."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"Great product...Although I do not breath much better, this product has eliminated my severe sinus pain...but you must keep using it (expensive) to maintain the effect...This product has really improved the quality of my life. Thanks"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I don't get sick. If I start to, I dose up, and I don't get sick. It is amazing. Period."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was a little hesitant to try this at first, not sure really how this could work. I am sold on this product for sure! It is a sure way to completely cleanse/detox your system!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This is a sterile dressing that has helped facilitate healing cuts in my husband's heel. It stays on the foot all day, and keeps out any bacteria, and has made the cracks in his heels heal with speed. Very good product."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I only wish I had found this a long time ago. Having a sensitive heel this has saved the day. I use it with shoes without shoes with socks without socks and it supports the ankle too, wow! I will buy again if this one ever wears out."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've owned this product for 9 months now and I'm still amazed that happiness can come from a piece of wood and a lathe! I spend 8+ hours a day on my feet and there is no shoe that makes it okay, but five minutes with this roller and I'm a happy woman. The double roller is definitely worth it or your other foot gets jealous (using both feet also helps to keep the roller from rolling away - something it really wants to do). This is a very inexpensive form of extreme happiness, it's not fattening or illegal but it IS addictive."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"Having had back and muscle pain for over 10 years from a workplace injury, I highly recommend this item for self massage purposes.It has been a life saver when my muscles spasm and ache."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"Have used this product, as recommended, and have not lost weight. But have had consistent daily BM for the last 2 weeks, which has reduced my extended belly. The first few days I did have quite a bit of gas, a nuisance but not the unexpected mess that I've been used to with the loose stool pills/powders I had been using. My pants seemed loose these last few days and a shirt that was a bit too tight actually hung nicely. At a meeting last night, my coworkers were complimenting me on my weight loss. This product is reasonably priced, compared to the other products I've purchased over the years."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,"This Anchor Hocking 1-Gallon Heritage Hill Jar (with Glass Lid) will last as long as you bother to take care of it. Obviously dropping it will break it into a hundred pieces, but when treated properly and handled carefully, you will get many satisfying years out of this. I guarantee it. Yes, you can store sugar, salt, pepper, coffee, or whatever else you like inside of this jar, and storing it in the corner of the kitchen counter is probably the perfect spot for the sake of convenience and to add to the overall look of the room. Go ahead and pick up this reliable jar."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,2.0,"First let me say that I am by no means a protein powder connoisseur, in fact, this is the first protein powder I have ever purchased. I simply wanted to add a little extra protein into my diet after I started lifting weights.The first time I tried it, I used 1 scoop of powder and added it to 1 cup of skim milk. On my way home from the gym I literally choked it down, it was so sweet (and weird tasting; although I am sure all protein powders taste this way). I then decided I would try to make it a little less sweet tasting by adding some instant coffee. My concoction is 1 scoop of the chocolate protein powder, 1 level tsp instant coffee granules, 1 cup milk. This makes it so much better, dare I say good.As far as people complaining about mixing, I use a battery powered milk frother to mix it, only takes about 30 seconds to mix without any clumps in sight.That being said - I give it 2 stars instead of 3 because I cannot even begin to imagine how sweet it would be if you followed the directions of 2 scoops to 3/4 cup liquid."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I bought the spoons when my daughter started solid food. The spoons are so beautiful that She liked the spoons right away. It happened that she was teething when I got them. She chewed on the handle of the spoon as a teething tool. No damage has ever been done. one thing I don't like about the spoon is that it's not very easy to clean the color of the food. For example, the spoon gets a little bit green after I feed my daughter spinach. But if you put the spoon into dish washer to wash or soap it in warm water for some time, the color will be gone."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,One word
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"First thing you can't beat the price anywhere and free shipping!I know that this product is mainly target for people with chronic fatigue or neuropathy. I don't have any such medical conditions. I have been using this product for a couple of months and the the most noticeable effect is recovery from strenuous activity. For example the first leaf clean up of the fall is always a killer. The next day my neck shoulders and lower back are stiff sore and just ache, taking about a week to go away. This year there was a snow storm the day after so I had to shovel after spending a day clean my yard. That said I was just a little sore the next day and had no problem shoveling ! Ribose taste a little sweet if added to water mixes smooth absolutely zero grittiness."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"I use this machine about 100 times a year, and my only complaint is that the mat wears out quite fast, that is that the AED won't activate anymore when you place the pads on the mat. I find myself replacing it about once a year...but really with the amount of use I get out of it it's been a good product, and the AED is one of the most economical and easy to use."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"this is the BEST candle i've ever had, my mom and i love it and have bought this scent for several years now. we have a large, open kitchen/family room and when we burn this candle it fills the entire space! i love it and will continue to purchase this scent. the shipping was fast too!"
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"I found this product to be very effective for several months. However I was foolish and thought I could take it in combination with other natural calming formulas, that incidentally had redundant ingredients. I unwittingly was overdosing myself. Then when my life got really stressful, and I had to turn to traditional medicine, I went through MAJOR withdrawal symptoms that were hell."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,This is one of the BEST baby products I have ever had! My son loves it. He will literally sit in this chair for an hour or two. He is four months old and the seat supports him in every way. (except his head of course) I will be getting another here soon. I am so in love and my son is a happy boy in this thing!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"This pasta actually has some zing, though not hot. Great flavor. It's my favorite flavor, lemon is second favorite. Buy it when it's on sale or subscribe for the discount (don't forget to cancel your subscription after it ships so you don't get stuck with a higher price on your second order!). Great pasta flavor. If you're just craving pasta with butter on it, this is the one to satisfy your cravings."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product really works!I've been taking these supplements after reading about them in the Journal of Life Long Holistic Micronutrition - a fantastic magazine if you really want to detoxify your body and spirit!Anyway, after three months of Bone Restore, I've found that my erections are firmer and longer lasting - it's amazing!You've got to try this supplement!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This is amazing - ordered for neck, but very base of spine kicking up something fierce.

Nice long ties/good knot stretchy fabric - and so easy to use. Had gotten the Myashi* Pillow, but no hot/cold application there, as well as no batteries no cords a real plus."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,3.0,"I bought this for use on my arthritis based on a recommendation from a friend. I don't know if they work or not. But, there are lots of pills in the bottle and they are not distasteful to dissolve under my tongue. In all fairness, I have this same reaction with many different pills, including Tylenol. They do not have the strong effects of the pain pills my doctor prescribes, but they have none of the ugly side effects either. Sometimes it feels like they're helping; sometimes, not. But, after all, pain is just a state of mind... Right? Hmmmm..."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"Very yummy, and easy to take anywehere. Fills me up. Would suggest this cookie for anyone wanting lose a few pounds."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"While I was born in the states I absolutely love having this on my cheese and tomato sandwiches. I had this while studying abroad in London, and I've been hooked ever sense. So anytime I can find it here in the states or online I always buy it. Unless you like pickled things in general you may not like this. My boyfriend thinks it's horrid but the tangy flavor and crunch adds a little something to your sandwiches."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"After fooling around years ago with several different teas, my wife settled on this one. I have no memory of what I was drinking before PG Tips, but that must mean that it was forgettable. PG Tips is not. The English seem to know what they're doing in this department. No surprise there. To me it has precisely the right flavor, full and rich. If I get up in the middle of the night, for whatever reason that happens, PG Tips is there to quiet me down and put me back to sleep. (Won't work for those sensitive to caffine, I'm afraid, but I am not.) Now, after a long absence, I've returned to drinking it in the morning in place of coffee. My wife still thinks of it as something to have in the afternoon. Just the best at any time. Try PG Tips!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I've used this product for years to remove lactic acids that build up after deep tissue massage therapy, or after a vigorous work-out. It's relaxing and if you want to, you can put in a drop or two lavender oil for the ultimate aromatherapy relaxation treatment. Bought one for me and one as a Christmas gift. This is one ""must have product for me! I don't recommend products unless I see results, and this delivers! Great Value & find on Amazon!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,3.0,"I didn't expect to fall into a trance or anything like that. But I wasn't hypnotized. Meaning, I didn't find myself viewing food any differently from listening to this CD. I did however, find the message and mental imagery of my ""new"" and thin self to be motivational...especially the big white room part. It also helped me to relax and fall asleep. So I still listen to it when I'm having trouble sleeping."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Picked this up today, spent the extra money on the deluxe...good size, soft, but nowhere close to enough heat. It barely gets warm & that's on the highest of 4 settings. Taking it back tomorrow & will try a different brand. Read several reviews on SoftHeat heating pads...many similar complaints about lack of heat. I have used Sunbeam in the past, & heat seems to be good, but they only last a few years, then don't heat up very much."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,"My favorite winter meal has always been a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Like most folks, I grew up eating Campbells, but after trying Amy's tomato bisque, I can tell you that this is in another league! It's delicious and is my new favorite soup, and I now keep at least a case on hand at all times when it's cold outside."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Upon opening the tissue paper-like bag inside of the thin cardboad box, my first thought was that there were a lot of little stem pieces and tiny twigs, probably in excess of 20 per teaspoon. I was not real impressed. After brewing a cup I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not good at describing flavors, but I did know that I really liked it and I drink alot of tea. I always add a good dollop of raw honey so that may have had some bearing on the flavor. I brewed the leaves twice and both cups were good. I then examined the used leaves. I found that they were bits and pieces, no whole leaves in sight. But considering what I paid for this tea I was still happy. I feel it is an excellent deal for the money, with a good, pleasing flavor, but due to the abundance of stem pieces and no whole leaves I felt I could not go higher than 4 stars. I would definately buy this again."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"It's hard to be sure if a product is working. It takes time to build up in the system and the pain relief is very gradual. When I stop taking it for a day or two, the pain is back to remind me. I am now a believer."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,These coconut bars are terrific. They satisfy the need for something sweet but are healthier than many snacks. I absolutely reccommend!

health personal care,health care,cough cold,4.0,"This product smells very good. It absorbes quickly and isnt greasy. Ive had it for a few months and used it on atleast 2 colds. When my baby was younger it did seem to help her breath a bit better,now that she is almost 8 months im not sure that its making a difference. Ill continue to use it in the hope that in the middle of the night it is giving her some reliefe. Ive also used a Mustel brand chest rub which seems stronger and that might be better now that she is older."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I cannot eat soybean oil or other soy products. I reviewed several online products, and this one did not mention soybean in the ingredients at least that I saw. But in fact, when it arrived and I read all of the ingredients it did in fact contain soybean. So I had to mail it back. I wish I could obtain a CoQ10 product without soybean.Pat Gladden"
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"This stuff is amazing! For the past month I had developed a bad cough with phlegm and couldn't get rid of it no matter what i did. When I finally went to the doctor, he told me I had allergies and would have to use an inhaler, allergy pill, and a prescribed nasal spray. I couldn't believe it! I was like is my nose that stuffed up? What I realized was that I had very bad post nasal drip. It didn't matter that I slept on 5 pillows to elevate my head. Every morning I would without a doubt cough of phlegm. Panicked, I started researching post nasal drip and how to get rid of it and found out about neti pots and the simply saline mist. I bought the simply saline mist because it is closely related to the neti pot and i wanted to test it out to see if it actually works before I purchase the neti pot. Guess what? It works!!What I like about the simply saline mist is that you don't really have to prepare the mixture (like the neti pot). You just tilt your head and poof it will come out of your other nasal passage. I was disgusted/ intrigued with how much mucus I had in my nose! I could breathe and smell fine before but wow!!!! Just imagine if I did feel my nose stuffed. My doctor was absolutely right, it was my allergies (that I never knew I had) and my nose all along. No tonsillitis or bronchitis like I thought I had before. I will be sure to use simply saline in the morning and night from now on. I am determined to get off an inhaler and back to health.Oh and another tip of advice. At first I couldnt get the the mist to empty out from the other nasal passage. Sure, mucus would be coming out of that one nose, but what the hell why wasn't it coming out of the other nose like I saw in demonstrations online? You have to make sure it is going towards your back of your throat. No, you wont be drinking it. Don't worry about that, it will get to the other side. Just make sure you have tissues next to you!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,Don't waste your freaking money. Its a placebo -- the product does NOT work. I've used different brands before so I know how it should work. No wonder its so cheap. The only reason it gets a star is because they shipped it fast. And I'm pissed that I purchased two bottles. Say no to Swanson.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Not bad, but i'm still not sure about that taste, my coffee taste completely different using this Stevia. And i was'n aware that i can only use 8 per day. :}"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I can't say enough good things about this product. First, I use a lot of Source Naturals products, and in my experience, they are always of high quality at a very reasonable price.Now as to why I'm taking this supplement...I'm working on recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome caused by leaky gut and gut dysbiosis (severe Candida infection for the last several years). I've read that people take 15-20 g of this a day to heal the gut. I started taking it on an empty stomach before meals, and the effects have been life-changing; and, no, I'm not being dramatic. It turns out that during times of stress, glutamine in the skeletal muscle can become depleted by up to 50% (perhaps even more based on some statistics I've read). The body needs glutamine to fuel immune cells and to repair tissues; the liver needs glutamine for detoxification, etc. So the body snags from skeletal muscle the glutamine that it needs. Although the body is able to make glutamine from other amino acids in the diet, during periods of prolonged stress (like chronic infection or disease), the diet simply is unable to provide a sufficient supply. This has certainly been true in my case. I seem to eat and eat all day long, but it's never enough for all the repair that is going on inside my body - yet I still have no energy. It's frustrating. This product has changed that. I'm not miraculously cured or anything like that, but it has certainly made a big difference in my quality of life as I continue to recover. I've got a lot more energy now, much less muscle aches, less difficulty digesting, and less allergies after eating. I am able to sleep through the night without waking due to hypoglycemia, and I no longer wake in the morning with muscle pain and fatigue. In short, I just feel a heck of a lot better.I can't speak for everyone, of course, but in my experience, I recommend that anyone working on recovering from a chronic illness take glutamine. Sift through the scientific journal articles online; many studies have been done, particularly on its effectiveness on healing and protecting the gut."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,I find this product okay for the price I paid. It is somewhat limited and I would have gotten an up-grade after seeing and using the pad. I guess you get what you pay for!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,These are the best I have tried. I'll do anything that might make me healthier while also possibly helping me keep my hair (tough fight I know) and these are probably the best I have tried for Grape Seed. I also did the NOW brand and they were also good but not quite the amount that these put in their capsules. Olympian are also a very nice brand with quality packaging and products all around.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"These were the worse pecans I ever got. They were adverized as sweet fresh shelled pecans.They are not, they were bitter tasted like last year crop. Do not buy them. You will be sorry if youdo just like I am very sorry I purchased them."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I got this a few days ago, and I've already been using it several times a day. Seven attachments and two speeds equals fourteen different sensations. I use it on back pain in the morning, foot pain when I get home, scalp and face massage to relax before I go to sleep, and, as other reviewers have mentioned, whenever I get my groove on solo. The attachments are PVC, a flexible, rubbery plastic that contains no latex or silicone, so you can use any type of massage oil, lotion, or ""personal lubricant"" products you want. They all wash off the attachments easily with regular soap and water. Like many of the other reviewers, I am seriously considering buying another Wahl as a backup, perhaps getting the one with the heated attachment next time. The price is a steal and well worth it. You will find at least one use for this thing."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I bought mine at the hospital gift shop shortly after giving birth to my daughter 3.5 years ago. I saw it and was like hey that's handy. I've never regretted that choice. I nursed her for 1 year using it, and its handy to have something to cover up that wont migrate. I love the stiffer area around the neck so that I could peak down on her. The fabric is nice weight, and even though I had her in AZ in the summer we were never overheated like we would have been with a blanket. I am due any day now with my second and this was the first thing I slipped into my diaper bag. I love the color choices! Makes me almost want to purchase a second one. A friend makes them, and hers are no where near as nice, though I won't tell her that."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,ice cream frozen desserts,5.0,"Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar. Tastes great, but you MUST be careful on pricing. I only paid $2.99 per bottle and at the time of writing this, the price is now $6.95. Consumer beware!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This tea retains its flavor and fragrance over several years and always delivers a flavorful tea that doesn't take like boiled wood.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,This product didn't seem to do anything for me. Good ol' fashioned demand does the trick when my supply seems to be decreasing.
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,"Well OK, it is cheap in the way of being inexpensive, so you aren't being ripped off for much. But this is an awful product. It would be expensive if it cost a nickle. I'm sure the goal of the manufacturer was to make this thing absolutely as cheap as they could, with quality the last consideration. It is wafer thin, with no heft, and made out of hard plastic.Start an IV and have a blood tranfusion handy before you use this, since the teeth of this comb are like needles and will painfully scrape your scalp; you could lose a lot of blood. I finally used some fine sandpaper to round off the sharp points of the teeth, and that helped a lot.Just putting the comb in your pocket will bend the teeth so the comb becomes progressively less effective. I'm telling you, this thing is a cheap piece of trash. You don't want this.This is the comb you would have bought if you were living in Moscow in the '70's, a comb designed and built by Central Planning. With no competition there was no need to be concerned about quality. Kind of like the Trabant. Hey, who knows, maybe someone found a million of these combs in some Soviet warehouse, bought them for a penny each, and put them on the market."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I can see through women's dresses again with use of Bilberry Ginkgo! Amazing.Just follow directions. Solgar is one of the finest brands you can trust.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,water,5.0,"I love this beverage because of the slight bitter taste. It's an adult orange soda that I would not have liked as a kid. Yesterday, I bought some egg nog at Safeway, and they had some cold bottles of Southern Comfort alongside the egg nog (smart cross-sell). I bought both (sucker). Frankly, I didn't like the taste of the Southern Comfort in the egg nog. Today, I tried a little Southern Comfort straight up, but found the smell and taste, slightly peachy or bubble gum - not grossly so, but too sweet. I did a review on the Southern Comfort and others also describe the peach aroma and taste. I probably would not buy Southern Comfort again. Then it struck me that it might go well with the San Pellegrino Aranciata in my refer (kind of like a fuzzy navel). Of course, often an idea doesn't play out that well. I poured about 1 ounce of Southern Comfort onto the ice in a cognac glass and then added 2 ounces of the San Pellegrino Aranciata. It smells very nice, tastes delicious, and the bitter of the orange peel balances out the sweetness of the peach in the Comfort - it's much more subtle and drinkable than a typically syrupy sweet fuzzy navel - a more sophisticated version. This is a great all-season sexy drink that everyone will like. My only caution would be that it tastes too good and goes down way too easily. I was playing with a name for this drink"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I ordered this product as described on Amazon.Com as I had read that it could possibly help with Enlarged Prostate issues as well as hair loss. At this time, it is too early to tell if this product will address some of those concerns, but I can state that the product came in a timely manner and as described. I am and have always been very pleased with Amazon's products, delivery and customer service. I would have rated this a 5 star, but it is too early to tell the results."

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"I was impressed with this when I first put it on because it blocked out all the light and didn't press against my eyes. However, once I lay my head down it's virtually impossible to get it to block out the light all the way. Will probably end up buying something else."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Been taking this wonderful supplement for 5-6 years now, and it seems to be the most absorbing one on the market.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"Decent taste, good protein/calorie mix; however, this flavor does not mix nearly as well as other Sytha-6 flavors (chocolate, chocolate peanut-butter, vanilla). Mix is lumpy, and one either has to wait several minutes for the drink to ""soak"" or use a blender. I would buy it again, but only if it was the only flavor available from Syntha-6."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I bought this for my mother and she loves this product because it works fast, just follow directions. Highly recommended. will do business again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,The thing people don't always notice is that most vitamins require 6 pills a day to reach the values they post. These vitamins only split the values in half so 1 pill a day is plenty. This will be my go to multi for as long as they make it.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"This product is huge, noisy and doesn't do anything exceptional. Actually just throw hot water in your feet in a way I cannot call it ""massage"". It's my worst online shopping experience ever. And to return the product I will have to pay more than $30, I lost time and money with that. Pay attention"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I always used Clear Blue digital tests which are pretty expensive around $35+ tx for two in a local drugstore but they were easier for me to read ""Pregnant"" or ""Not pregnant"" and no need to sit with a microscope over the test strip not to miss a second line. This time around I was 100% sure that I am pregnant(because I knew the conception date) and as always bought Clear Blue (they claim results 5 days sooner). I tested in a morning 1 day before my period and result came out ""Not pregnant"". I was kinda upset and went to Amazon to find a cheaper test with a good reviews( I often use Amazon for great deals). This test was top of the line. I read few reviews,looked and the price and quantity and decided to give it a try. So I placed an order with a rush delivery( Thank you Amazon Prime for fast and free delivery). So I got my test next day and since there are so many of them I did not wait till morning and tested right way.As other reviewers said you need to wait 5 min before tossing the test.5 mins later I saw the second line which was pale but I could see it without microscope. I was so excited! So I started to test every few hours afterward during several days till my line became darker than control line. So conclusion is these tests are great value( I think doctor's offices use them too)and I will never buy Clear Blue digital test again."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,3.0,"First sampling yielded a ""not-quite yuck"" factor but definitely not a ""hooray"" either. I've gotten used to them and will finish the order, but future orders will be Mexican Harvest. In general, I love the crunch and healthy ingredient list as I avoid traditional crackers."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I was alarmed when I first saw the size of these vitamins but I am pleased to say that they are easy to swallow with a morning smoothie. No after taste or stomache upset. My skin became flawless within five days of taking these. Very pleased.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I am Raster from thecandidadiet.com forum and I use this product every day. Its a very effective long term antifungal and it is very difficult for candida to adapt to this when compared to other antifungals. I highly recommend this product as well as a good 14-strain 30+ billion probiotic to help get over candida. This stuff is very effective and safe for long term use.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This seems to offer 100 capsules of 1080 mg burdock each, which sounds like a great deal, but if you check (I had to go to vitaminshoppe.com to see a complete label), it's a ""serving size"" of 1080 mg burdock, which consists of 2 capsules, each with 540 mg burdock, and so there are only 50 ""servings"" per package, and this is a package of 100 capsules of 540 mg burdock, just like all the others, so it's comparable/reasonable, but not the ""amazing"" deal it appears to be.Vitamin Shoppe - Burdock Root, 1080 mg, 100 capsules"

I will take the recommendation ofinger Energy Bars are too sweet and pass on this product.If nutrion and ingredients are not available hard to trust this product
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,I bought these because I had previously been using the Sharkies kids chews for long runs and was unable to find them at stores near me. These are the perfect size to put in my running belt and are easily digestable while I'm working out. They taste great and I even keep one in my purse for those times when I'm out doing errands and need a quick bite.
health personal care,health care,thermometers,4.0,"I have been using a temporal artery thermometer for my toddler but needed a rectal thermometer for my newborn.

health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I was in rehab for almost 6 months. They used them in the rehab center to clean up patients to clean up table, wipe down telephone,food spills and etc. When I was released to go home, they sent some home with me and I have used them ever since - better than 5 years now. I like the dispenser because it gives you a moist single cloth and another is ready for the taking.I am 85 years old and i don't know what I would do without Prevail Premium washcloths. I order them by the case from Amazon. They Have the best price I have found any place. Thanks Amazon."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This product is very effective. The commercials were a bit of a turn-off, but the product is great. My fear is that they are discontinuing it. It's becomming harder to find. Amazon is the only place."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"My son is 13 months and he loves this cup. It fits in his little hands much better than a cup with handles. The main thing I like about these cup is that they dont spill at all! My son would chew his soft spout cup and dribble juice everywhere. His other cup leaked too. I was pleasantly surprised when these cups didn't leak even when dropped on the floor. My son is breastfed and he didn't really take to his other sippy cups, now he giggles and gets excited when I pour juice into this cup. I wash and reuse the cup so these will last a long time."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The backdrop (skip to 2nd paragraph if you just want the product review).. I'm a health conscious, young male from NY and I've been looking for the best vitamins and supplements I could find to get into a long-term routine and stick with it. I got introduced to supplements through Garden of Life products, which are great and have excellent sources. I recommend them if you are looking for super-food supplements. Although now I personally take 'Source Naturals Men's Life Force Multiple'. Anyway, after reading the reviews and getting interested I decided to try these as an immune system supplement and I'm completely impressed.After the change of this season, 3 people in my house became sick with a cold. I did not and I credit it to this product primarily because I was taking the recommended dosage for staying healthy and a few weeks into their illness I started to get a mucus build-up (like you experience right before you get sick) and decided to ramp up the dosage to the recommended amount. After doing this, and drinking mixtures with apple cider vinegar, I got over it almost immediately. Absolutely no nonsense, gone. However, in order for any supplement to work, you have to eat properly in the first place. Taking in a lot of sugar, drinking, depressing the immune system with junk it can barely make use of all reduce the effectiveness of anything you take. So keep that in mind & I hope this review helps in some way."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I grew up eating Muesli. I will mix some of this with low-fat plain yogurt, if it is still dry for your taste add a dash of milk. My kids also like a little honey or maple syrup mixed in (this is still way better for them than those sugar filled cereals)! Muesli with yogurt is a tasty way to get fiber, protein, as well as the healthy live active cultures!As you find yourself ordering your second or third shipment of this I would recommend just putting it on auto-reorder, that way you save % each time!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,1.0,"The spices smelled heavenly when they arrived. However, the product was poorly packaged, and the seal was broken with the spices leaking out into the box. And, no, I wasn't going to try a food that was that poorly packaged. Personally, I think sanitarily made and packaged food products are just as important as products that taste good."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I love my Total Woman vitamins. I got my vitamins for a great price and fast delivery. I would definitely order from them again.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"This is terrific and works precisely as advertised. It is relatively thin as these things go so it doesn't stay warm as long as some of the smaller alternatives. Works best if you put a blanket over it. A microwave with carousel is required if you don't want to ruin it. The ""stuffing"" stays put. The key advantage and reason to go with this is its coverage area and the flexibility to fold it over to cover a smaller area and stay warm longer."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"After trying a bunch of different oatmeal (Steel cut, Irish, rolled, etc, etc) I have come to the realization that this is one of, if not the best breakfast oatmeal out there. At Amazon's price you really can't beat the 4 pack deal too.Overall the consistency of the oats is something you normally can't find, its a pleasant mix of steel cut texture (semi hard, bits) while still being like rolled oats (mushy)- once finished I like to add Bob's recommendations, milk and honey, which also helps cool it down. My own personal additions include a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar, though I use this sparing since part of the reason for making it is the protein content. At 6 grams per serving it's right up there with steel cut for oatmeal for high protein content. If you're a weight lifter who is looking to mix it up I'd recommend this all the way. (Or anyone for that matter)Concerning complaints of cooking time"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This Clif Bar gel (I've tried both the Razz and the Chocolate flavors) are, like most gels, easy to carry, open, and eat. The product info states that Clif Bar gels are ""fast-acting and easy-to-digest, semi-liquid sources of carbohydrates (70% complex/30% simple) and electrolytes.""Okay, what I am looking for is a mix of sugars to fuel my muscles during a race (I'm using one every 6 miles), and the right combination of electrolytes for mid and long-distance running. Is this it? Well, I haven't passed out yet.I do appreciate the use of organic ingredients, and, as I remember, it does not contain HFCS."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I love this heating pad. I have used it several times per week, often daily for over a year now and it is still perfect. I don't understand the low ratings. (which is why I had to add my review) I picked mine up at Walmart and loved it so much that I bought another for my office. I use it for castor oil packs, sore muscles, and tummy aches or just when I want a little extra warmth. I love that it is washable, large and soft. I appreciate the auto turn-off as I often fall asleep with it on. I'm so glad that I did not look at the reviews before I bought it, because I may never have purchased it. I would not want to live without it!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Because I am allergic to many scented products (most are scented by chemicals not natural products) I use lemon oil, spearmint oil and or peppermint oil and make my own mix to spray when someone walks into my office with a scented product (try to drop theirs to the floor with my natural one), and I use these droppers so I don't waste my oils."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've used these for biking and running, and they are a great way to carry energy. I used to mix up some gatorade for long rides or runs, but now I just bring some of these Gels along instead.They are easy to eat on the go (if you pre-open the package before going out on a ride).I like all of the flavor's I've tried so far. They aren't quite as tasty as gummybears, but they have a similar texture."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Ok, first of all, this multivitamin is very complete, it even has things others don't, which is really good. the problem is that it has too much of some things. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that these pills contain saw palmetto which is a plant used for prostate health. Some people claim it also helps hair regrowth. However, one of the side effects of it is that it can cause erectyle dysfunction! Believe me, I personally experienced this while taking these pills. I completely lost my sexual drive. In addition to that, it also caused insomnia! Do your own research and you'll confirm what I'm telling you. I could not even finish the bottle. Be careful with saw palmetto."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Bought this item for my wife to help with foot problems. She normally does not like gadgets but loved this product. It has helped with the foot problems and I have used it and it felt great. It heats the water and when the water gets too hot, it is very easy to tap the on/off switch with your foot and continue enjoying this foot bath. Strongly recommend it even if you dont have foot problems."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"My boyfriend sleeps very light and says my snoring is very loud and keeps him from sleeping. He bought the strips for my nose and said they didn't help much. Then he bought this stuff. I was NOT optimistic. I expected it to taste terrible and not work at all. Well, it has no taste. I mean none at all. It feels a little different -like maybe kind of dry but not really. It seems to make me salivate a little more than usual but not so much to make that a problem. Most importantly is that it actually works! My snoring only woke him once when I rolled onto my back - and even then it was several hours after using the product. It seems like it might wear off after about 5 or 6 hours so tonight I told him to wake me when he hears me snoring and I will just respray my throat and that should solve that problem. Ok enough about how it helped him, let's talk about how it helped me! Lol... Ok I am always tired and exhausted every day of my life. The first night I used this I woke up with swollen eyes and a slight headache and I didn't know why. The next night I used it, I woke up feeling well rested and got through the whole day without that exhausted feeling. I think my snoring was keeping me from sleeping soundly and now that I'm using this I seem to get a much better nights rest. I think that first night i used it, i slept so hard it caused the swelling in my eyes and a headache! I'm excited about this stuff because it actually works, it doesn't cost a fortune, doesn't have tons of horrible side effects and now my boyfriend and I both sleep better!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I was SO excited to have found tea that tastes like aveda tea without the price. Based on the high reviews, I figured I would give this tea a try... I just received this tea and it tastes NOTHING like Aveda tea. It does not that that great licorice after-taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"For someone who had DHEA levels reading at .8, I was in dire need of some bioidentical DHEA supplementation. I started taking the DHEA 4 nights ago at 50mg twice a day. I decided to take it at this dosage for the first week as a boost. The night I started taking it, I finally slept through the night (usually I end up having to wake up for the loo). The next day, I noticed that I was drinking more water and using it too rather than having to use the bathroom more frequently. I had more energy than I had in weeks and did not have to take any naps during the day. The same was the case for the first 3 nights. However, certain events took place after that that were too emotional draining so I ended up having to rest during the day yesterday. Otherwise, so far so good.Natrol DHEA tablets are small and dissolve easily. So I get the satisfaction of feeling it dissolve a little under my tongue before I swallow it with water (may be weird to some but I feel like it may work better that way!). Best feature of Natrol's DHEA is that it is VEGETARIAN. Took me a while to find a brand that was vegetarian and affordable!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I'm sure this product is helpful for some, as the other reviews testify. But, I think it's important to recognize that it has very serious interactions with very common medications, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. I ordered it thinking, ""great! I can sleep better!"" but after doing so, I researched it online after I got it(I know, should have done so first!). It appears to be helpful but only if you don't regularly use other medications. To me, the risk to me is too great...I take pain medication from surgery on occasion as well as aspirin daily, and I don't want to mess around with it.Just because something is an herbal supplement doesn't make it safe, and it's scope is outside the FDA's approval, so theoretically, you can't be sure what you are getting.I'm giving it three stars because I think herbal supplements that have SO many dangerous interactions should be more forthright with explaining these prior to someone purchasing them. Given that it can be purchased here online with no label or detailed information is sort of scary....one would assume it's safe. I think it's important for the 'buyer beware' policy to be in our minds when we order, but at the same time, if they aren't providing the information up front before purchase, it could be dangerous.Additionally, I did my research at several websites, not just one that might be biased. It's pretty evident that considering the side effects and drug interactions is a very big deal. I hope you find this helpful in some way before you buy."

I took my after meal readings one after the other and my readings were 97, 133 and 162. This is ridiculous. Doctors recommend this one because the company might be paying them extra money for doing so. Anyways, all that physicians care about is filling their own pockets. I am highly unsatisfied and will return it today."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,4.0,"I purchased this seat for my 4th (and last) baby. Because she is our last, I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This seat is less then half the price of the last booster seat I had (the Fisher Price Space Saver) but I like it much better!I understand the two seats have different intentions. The space saver is meant to be more like a high chair and is meant to accomodate young babies, but as a booster this seat beats that one out of the water. I love that there is no cover to clean around or have to wash out. It's all plastic so it just wipes down. The adjustable base is easy to adjust and allows me to put my daugther at just the right height.The tray is nice and secure and she has not been able to pop it off, which is a great as that's an issue I've had with seats in the past!There are 2 things that kept me from giving it 5 stars, 1) I would love to see a 5 pt. harness option. My 8 month old is a busy body and she as able to turn and pull herself up unless I have the waist part very tight, which means adjusting it depending on what she's wearing and what kind of diaper I have her in (cloth or disposable). Might not be an issue for some, but it is for us. 2) the snap in tray doesn't snap in tightly. She easily removes it each time I put her in the seat. Not a big deal right now as she is not self feeding yet, but I'll probably not use it once I let her, as it could end up being very messy for my floor.Otherwise, I have no reservations about this seat. The price is perfect and it does it's job well!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,sports drinks,5.0,The product is bright and cheerful pink and very sturdy. The customer service was excellent. I had some questions and they were responded to in a very timely manner with much respect.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I ordered this protein powder a month ago and I like it so far. The taste is good, the price is acceptable. The only thing I'm not very satisfied is the solubility. Looks like this protein powder is not easy dissolved in the milk 'cause I saw some clumps in the milk lots of times. Anyway it's not something I can't tolerate. So I would give 4 stars for this product."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,3.0,"About a month ago - just in passing - my doctor gave me a bottle of 1mg Melatonin chewable tabs. For my whole life, I've had periods of sleeplessness and them periods when I sleep very well.When I went to see him, it was for my routine annual physical and I have no idea why he just gave me these -- other than the fact that it's probably the only free drug he's ever gotten because he won't take ""the good stuff"" from drug reps!Okay. I took two (so that's 2mg) of the chewables (same manufacturer as these) which worked fairly well. When I did wake up at 4 AM, I just let another melt under my tongue, and I drifted off. I woke up as though I had had a decent night's sleep, but I certainly was not a model for a TV ad where I had awakened REFRESHED and ready for a triathalon. I felt okay and not at all lethargic.When I saw that Amazon carried the same manufacturer's Melatonin in a 2 MG TIME-RELEASE, I knew that these would be perfect. If the ""chewables"" worked, then time-release would be better because there would be a steady stream of Melatonin released over an 8 hour period. My logic was so good that I got two. That's 480 nights if I disregarded the warnings about continuous use.Unfortunately, the first night, they didn't work at all. I was up all night. The second night, I did fall asleep, but when I awoke, I was ... not groggy ... but not full of energy either.I stopped for two nights, and tried again, and this time I awoke are 3 AM, and just got up and read.I'd give the chewables 4 stars, but with several caveats. Melatonin is a hormone that helps with adjustments to circadian rhythms. If your rhythms are in synch with nature, don't fix what ain't broken. If you have a periodic sleepless night, take the chewables (peppermint's good) if you think that you're going to be restless. If you take these time-released pills, you're assuming that you are going to have a sleepless night, and this may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.So I'm back to the chewables a couple of times every two weeks - sometimes even when I'm exhausted from hiking or raking a continuous supply of leaves, Mother Nature's own time-released pain in the neck. The time-released just haven't released or, as I said and as silly as you may think, you may be up just waiting for them to kick in because you know that you should drift off. The only place I drift to at 2 AM is the fridge."

health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,I always had problems with multivitamins affecting my stomach and making me sick. I started this formula about 6 years ago and still love them. They give me energy and make me feel awesome and I when I don't take them i really notice a difference. Everything in them is organic and they actually go through a cold fusion process as opposed to other methods of traditional vitamin making. ALl of the ingredients are frozen while the vitamin is made to ensure we receive as much of the nutritional value as possible. Other brands will typically heat the ingredients during the process and some nutrients are lost. I'm a fan and believe me I am super picky so enjoy!!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I've been taking this for 2 years while my hubby and I tried to conceive. I didn't have any problems in all that time. It is a HUGE, non-coated pill, but I didn't have too much trouble swallowing it.Then I got pregnant.At about 5 weeks, it became impossible to swallow without gagging and forcing it down my throat. I almost vomited trying to swallow the darn thing. It's just too big!!I only just learned that in 2008, the FDA identified this vitamin as being number 5 in the list of prenatal vitamins containing the most lead! You can read more about it by doing a search for ""prenatal vitamins lead"" and then clicking on the link to the FDA's site.Definitely scary stuff!"

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,I used this pump with my son who was breast feed for 7 months. It does not hold suction very well and when it did I found it ok strong. I got tears along my nipple that I didn't even get from my baby latching on. I took it on some over night trips when I didn't have my baby and it did not re-leave me at all I would pump 8 oz and still be in pain in certain spots.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,2.0,"*I realize Amazon hasn't touted this as a beauty item, but many other places do and I wanted to write this review for those who found this item in the manner I did.*I attempted to use this as some other posters mentioned - for acne in addition to insect bites. On several beauty sites, this was touted as a great way to get rid of blackheads, etc. Not even close. Deep cysts, it helps bring to the surface a bit, but definitely not for smaller blemishes.I'm writing this review for those of you who happen upon this item in the same manner I found it. This is NOT a beauty tool and will not help with clogged pores.Hope that helps those of you who were looking at this item as I originally was! Best wishes to you folks who wanna go camping with it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I can't find this in any of my local stores so I was thrilled to find it on amazon. Had purchased a bottle in the uk and loved it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I usually use KAL liquid stevia, but this was cheaper so I decided to give it a try. Maybe I'm just used to KAL, but I just didn't taste the same sweetness with this. I couldn't seem to get the amount right.The NOW brand is syrupy whereas KAL is liquid, and you need less of the NOW brand. The NOW brand seemed to sweeten thin drinks, like tea, better than thicker ones, like coffee with milk. The KAL brand gives me consistent results no matter what I put it in.I felt like I was tasting a bitter aftertaste (NOW brand) that kind of ""stuck"" to my tongue, but it was very slight, almost ignorable and I don't know if I was just thinking that because I'm not crazy about the syrupy consistency.This stuff isn't bad overall, but I've been using KAL for a few years and this isn't good enough to make me want to switch."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I am nearly finished my first can of Alive, and I couldn't be happier with it. I started off drinking a scoop in plain water.I can't say it was the most tasty thing I have ever put in my mouth, but I was drinking it for the protein and vitamins, not for the pleasure of taste so I would gulp it down and go on with my day. The flavor isn't bad, its a bit tart and bland. Soon I began mixing chia seeds in the glass, letting both the chia and the Alive sit with the water for 5-10 minutes, and I found it tasted much better for some reason. Now I mix it with chia, fizzy Acai Vit-C powder and water and I love it. I once mixed it with apple juice and it was fantastic, but I avoid juice so that won't be my regular breakfast. It is hard to mix, as others have said, but again, I am not trying to create a culinary masterpiece... I drink it with the lumps just fine and am happy I am getting good nutrition. Eat to live, not live to eat... at least I can do that once a day."

I buy mine at a local grocery store and I can't imagine ever going without it. The tea bags are individually packaged and come in your standard-shaped tea bags.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"We have never been to the restaurant, but we bought a small canister of this Stubb's Chili Lime Spice at a gourmet foods market. We like chili/lime and wanted to put some kick into our salsa. Oh my. It's the best stuff out there, and I can say that with authority. Read on.During all of our futile trips down the spice aisle of every place in town, we picked up chili/lime spice mixes by other brands. Nothing compares, and believe me, I've tried them all by now.It's been pretty sad around here lately. We have tried to ration the Stubb's, and we watch each other veeeeery closely when it's being used. If someone accidentally shakes some on the counter instead of the plate, there is an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes while we ponder how many bites we have missed out on having properly spiced.So I'm so relieved to be able to buy this whole CASE of Stubb's for my boyfriend for Christmas. It's not the most expensive gift he will be getting, but it will definitely be his favorite. And mine too!"

However, it has a VERY strong peppermint taste. I decided to swallow as a pill, not let it sit under my tongue to dissolve as I just couldn't handle that! I am used to real peppermint - I make a tea with peppermint essential oil from a very reputable company."

Also this is the vit E that you want.I have this product for months and the more I take it and learn about it the more I respect it. Like I said, the real deal. the price is good.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is soooo delicious. Some reviewed the taste as too coconut, I guess you should complain if you purchased Vegetable oil or Olive oil. But it is COCONUT oil, hence the flavor. I use it on toasted bagels, potatoes, to stir fry string beans/ almond slivers. I've used it in my lotions, and hair conditioner (in its liquid form, I mixed it into the products). When my son was a baby, we used it for his delicate skin instead of baby lotions, a great massage oil for adults as well."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"This product works, period. I am a skeptic by nature but not so dumb as the one guy who gave this product one star. Anyone who thinks that homeopathic medicine by nature is superstition is just ignorant. Over 3/4 of the drugs produced in the World (yes, the US as well) are based on natural ingredients modified, strained or concentrated to intensify and isolate their affects. Don't beleive me? Next time you take an aspirin or cold medicine go ahead and look up the ingredients on wiki and follow where their ingredients originate, dumb ass. Everything starts with minerals, plants, algae, saltwater, etc.So for you to say something like this and deter someone like myself from giving a product like this a chance is ignorant, just ignorant. To me your review looks as if you didn't even try the product. I'm 37 years old, a doctor, and just tried it for the first time a few days ago. I've tried every cold medicine under the sun, and each one, like dayquil, Coricidin, Alka Seltzer, etc. worked to releive my symptoms but lasted a few hours, made me jittery (pseudoepehdrine) and my cold lasted a week or more. this product, I took for about a day and a little the next am, and my cold was gone.Maybe next time you should try something first, and then if it is truly a hoax then give everyone your HONEST opinion, not your prejudiced one."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I have never had to deal with lice until my son started itching his head constantly! I checked it out and sure enough...he had lice. We treated with Nix, and I spent hours making sure I had all the nits out. A couple months later...lice again. Ugh! I had done everything I was supposed to do. This time, I treated with Nix again. The following day, we picked up a Robi comb. We ran it through my sons hair and came out with about 15 more lice. They were all incredibly tiny. The second day we found about 6, and today there was only 1. I plan to check his hair with the comb every day until next week. I figure that way I will catch any hatchlings I may have missed during the nit picking. Without this comb, we would have been back to square one in no time. The Nix definitely cut the numbers down, the comb finished them off."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"After reading up on krill oil I came to the conclusion that NKO looked the best. Well it turns out it is great! Do not listen to bad reviews, they are being rediculous.The fishy smell some people are referring to is extremely mild and there IS NO FISHY AFTER TASTE what so ever... So I don't see why it would matter what it smelled like before hand anyway. I'm in college after taking these for a month my memory started to improve and my grades went up!MEGARED HAS SORBITOL! STUDIES INDICATE THAT THIS CHEMICAL CAUSES EXTREMELY DETRMENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS WHEN TAKEN IN SMALL QUANTITIES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELFAbout two months after I started using NKO I received a free sample of megared krill oil. Sorry megared, not gonna work.Sorbitol was right there in the ingredients. On the package, megared explains that their krill causes no fishy after taste because the fats are carried in a phospholipid form and are readily absorbed by the body. I believe this is probably true because NKO has no after taste. Why then megared? Why do you use sorbitol? My guess is they want to avoid the inevitable fishy smell that the bottle has when you open it. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK. Though less potent, the fishy smell is still obviously there, the sorbitol has a slight masking effect but he smell but it is still clearly present. So, people that complained about the smell, go ahead and switch to megared, you will have your slightly better smell when you open the bottle. But you can also have fun with the health problems you have in about five years because you wanted to take megared."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I don't care what anyone says, these do work.My husband was the lab rat with a horrible cold.Thinking he was due for another round of antibiotics for a sinus infection thatnever wanted to leave I gave him these.He took these according to directions and by the next day he looked and sounded 100% better.His nose wasn't stuffy/gross and no more sore throat.One additional day taking these and he really is better with no issues at all.I bought these because Chestal worked extremely well for my son.Boiron products have been great for us so far, I wouldn't hesitate to try another oneif the need arises."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"I love this stuff. I've tried a few brands and they're all much the same at the end of the day, but Patak's version isn't too bad at all. If you've never had lime pickle, bear in mind that it's an acquired taste, like olives. My first reaction was that it tasted like curried soap, but these days a good tiger roll with thick slabs of cheddar isn't the same without this stuff in it. It works on cheese topped oatcakes as well and when I'm most badly in need of a spice fix, I can eat the stuff straight off a spoon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been plagued by herpes, on my lip, since I was a small child. I tried several remedies over the years, but, Super Lysine Cream is one of the cures that was definitely more effective.

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"I was torn between buying a high chair or a booster seat so my 6 month old could sit with us during dinner. After reading other reviews, we went ahead and opted for the Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster seat and I'm really glad we did. It's usually at our diningroom table but has been in restaurants, other people's homes, our livingroom floor, etc. It is extremely easy to clean and portable. So glad we went this route."
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"Honees are quite possibly the best thing ever created. I discovered these purely by accident at a candy shop while seeking cough drops for my cough and I was so impressed that I got home and bought a whole box, despite the fact that my cough was actually receding. Great stuff. I keep some around just in case someone acquires a cough, or not."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"This product does seem to work. However,I cannot give it glowing recommendations. I am hungry a lot of the time. My major complaint is that it tastes really awful. I have tried vanilla, cinnamon etc. but have found nothing that helps make the taste less offensive."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I bought these as an additive for my Lactation Cookies. It does the trick and does not affect taste or texture at all. I've had it for months now and baking a dozen weekly and am only about halfway through it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These multivitamins are excellent. I have noticed a substantial difference in my child's health. Her energy and focus has done a major turn around. What really turned me on to these vitamins (to be honest) is how they have changed her bowel movements. She would have horrible constipation, and ever since I have regularly given her these vitamins she has no problem whatsoever.I was going to my not so local health food store and was paying $30.00 for the 120 count jar, which to me wasn't a big deal because I knew how much they improved her health.There is no comparison to the other children vitamins sold out there, I would never consider another multivitamin. Now knowing that I can get them for MUCH cheaper on Amazon is a blessing and a lot less hassle of having to drive out of town to get them. They even arrived two days earlier than expected. I was super excited. And to tell you another truth, I myself eat them and give them to my husband as well!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"Delicious as usual for this cookie. Love them. Glad Amazon had them on their website, esp. on sale when I ordered them. Can't beat that."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The last few years I have developed a case of SAD but didn't want to resort to Rx meds so I read about 5-HTP and thought I would give it a try. I found Jarrow Formulas 5-HTP 100mg caps on Amazon and the results are as follows:The first night I took it I couldn't fall asleep because of the boost it gave me! Which was okay with me, because I hadn't felt that way in at least a month. I found myself lying in bed feeling rejuvenated and energized, the next morning I awoke with not enough sleep and I felt okay. To go from feeling completely exhausted when getting 8 hours of sleep before 5-HTP to feeling energized off of 6 with 5-HTP was awesome! The next day I noticed that I had a little pep in my step, and the third day I found myself laughing, really laughing, and I realized I hadn't really smiled or laughed in a long time. Here I am, 5 days later, and even though there is no sun to be spoken of and it's been raining the past few days, life is good!I finaly feel like myself again. I'm singing, doing dishes, life is good. I feel like this product could really help someone who's suffering through their depression. I wish I had known about 5-HTP years ago!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I got it last night, and was excited. Just wanted to make some crystals, now first I boiled the alum in the water on the stove, that created a goo-y substance that was pretty fun. Didn't work for what I needed it for but it was entertaining, then I desolved it in hot water off the stove, much better (But not the cool goo-y thingie). Excited to see the Crystals I can get out of this stuff. Thank you!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,You have got to be kidding on the price of this!!I have bought this product for years all across Canada including the far north and Vancouver island and have NEVER paid more than 6.00 CD. Most often it is less than 4.00 CD.It is a fabulous product if you like a sweet thick sauce.I was first introduced to cacip manus 15 years ago by my Dutch inlaws who spent several years in Indonesia. Another brand is Kikkoman but is is much pricier. I guess this seller thinks he will use that as a guideline.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"The pic doesnt do any justice. In person it is a very beautiful bracelet. The colors are very bribrant. I ordered 2 for a gift and i wish i would have gotten one myself. The price is resonable too, just shop around."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"I occasionally suffer from bad neck spasms and experience agonizing pain. I went to my local pharmacy and purchased something to put in the freezer that had little pea like beads in it that fastened around the neck. I paid $20 and it was horrible. It was made out of plastic and the edges cut into my skin and it was too tight around the neck.I was desperate for something comfortable, that could adjust to a bigger neck size and be used as a heating pad and for cold therapy. When I got this I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this item. It is very well made, very cushioned and it fits comfortably around my neck and holds well with the velcro. It can be helpful for big necks and little necks because it can be adjusted.It covers a lot of area and I like the fact that it covers the back of my shoulders well, the nape of the neck all the way up to the bottom of my ears and jaw bone as well as all around the throat.It is a little tricky at first getting it to warm up to a temperature in the micro that is perfect. In my Sharp Carousel microwave it takes about 35-45 seconds on each side. Sometimes more sometimes less. If it feels too hot, just let it cool off a minute or so. Once you do this a few times you will get the hang of it and know exactly how long to heat it up for. The heat really helps my neck spasms. It stays warm for about 20 minutes or so and then wanes. I just throw it back in the microwave again.The cold version is nice, but does not last very long and does not feel as cold as I would like it to be despite being in the freezer over night. I noticed the coolness will last only between 15-20 minutes tops. When it is cold, it feels like a cool damp towel and is quite flexible, not hard like a block of ice.When the coolness wears off, I take a bunch of ice cubes, place them in a ziploc bag, wrap that in a dishtowel and place it under the Elasto-gel Cervical Collar. Then I close it around my neck with the velcro and I am ok for a while longer. It holds the ice pack on for me.I would give it 5 stars if the cold and warm therapy would last longer, but the ice cube method works and the collar holds it in place wonderfully.If you do the ice cube method, please make sure you keep the ice cubes inside a ziploc bag and keep a dishtowel around it because this cervical collar is not allowed to get wet. If it gets wet, the gel inside it will get ruined and render the collar useless."

health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"I have used the Ov Watch for MANY cycles, most of which are not ""regular"", meaning I do not ovulate on the normal day 14. I have never had an issue with inaccuracies or conflicting information from urine strips, the Ov Watch has always been right on. My husband and I have struggled with infertility and the Ov Watch has definitely helped us to conceive 2 children (1 in which ended in miscarriage). I don't understand why people have had so many problems with the Ov Watch, it is so simple to use and could not work better in my opinion (possibly user error??).Do not hesitate to buy this watch, it is worth the money and WORKS!!!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,4.0,"Love the taste of Annie's organic Mac & Cheese. Plus it's a great source of fiber and is certified organic, making it a better alternative to Kraft and conventional brands. Serve it up with some steamed broccoli or a toss salad and you've got a nutrish and delish meal in a jiffy."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I am reordering, so, clearly, I like this cereal. I normally have it for breakfast at work. I put some cereal and hot water from the coffee machine in a big coffee mug with lid, mix well, cover, and let it sit for 5 minutes. At this point I add some Craisins, mix again, cover, and let it sit until it cools down (another 5 minutes). I like the flavor, and the fact that it has no added salt. At about 2.50 per bag the price is good too."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,"I was planning to use these two ways; as a key chain pill holder, and as a tag holder for my cats. After seeing all the reviews about how small it was i thought it would be perfect for cat tags. I have small pills that will easily fit inside, but they are a bit large for my cats. I am still debating whether or not i will be returning them. However i rated them as 4 stars because they are exactly as advertized. I wish there were more pictures and measurements though."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I wanted to start off with fresh tubes after using my Medela pump for one year with my first child. I don't know if that is necessary, but the pump had sat idle for almost a year, so I thought I'd play it safe.These tubes are exactly the same as the original tubes that came with my pump. They work perfectly and I'll probably order another pair when my third child arrives! If you can't get them for free from Medela (apparently many have had success with that), then this is the place!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This massager provides a nice restful buzz as is it vibrates up and down my scalp. I got it as a gift and thought it was moronic and another useless gift until I tried it. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it was a real de-stresser as it vibrated my troubles away. This was so good, I actually started dozing and felt my body go limp. Silly sounding ---- yes. Relaxing ----- double yes. I just had to put my 2 cents in on this one. If you are into massages, this is calming."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"After hearing about ""the stick"" in PT (but never having tried it) once discharged I opted to purchase one for myself to continue to keep my body healing and releive pain and it does that and so much more. It gives you a sense of independence when you can get to areas that you would normally avoid, pay someone to stimulate, or worse; continue to be in pain by doing nothing! I highly recommend this product as its very useful, easy to use and a great tool. Best to buy it in conjunction with a durable Foam Roller it is useful for getting into spots the foam roller can't in a toally different self-guided process that you control 100%"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"If you like Acacia honey, you will like this honey. Acacia honey is a light flavor. I was getting very disappointed that Meeks honey has been getting darker and darker. They have lots of dark Meeks honeys for sale, but no light honey. I think Acacia honey has to come from Italy. I used to buy another brand of Acacia honey in a gourmet shop, but they stopped carrying it years ago. So, this stuff is really the best. Once you get spoiled by Acacia honey you won't want to go back to dark honeys. Clover Honey is ok, but kind of bland compared to Acacia honey."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This product was advertised in Prevention Magazine. I tried it and I think it's just wonderful. This particular shipment, however, is not for one pill a day; it's 6 pills a day. (Guess I wasn't paying attention!) This is not so easy for me to do. I'm going back to one a day for my next shipment. It's really great stuff!"

I'd obtained my last jar years ago from a small mom and pop RX store since out of business. Couldn't find it anywhere else I looked but was happy to find it on Amazon.com. It's a very small jar, but you don't need to use a lot and it lasts for a long time."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I can't get decaf in my local grocery store anymore. At least on Amazon I don't have to pay shipping. Best home-made decaf.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,3.0,"I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewers say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.Sucralose replaced aspartame---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"Before purchasing the Priva Ultra Plus sheet protector, my husband I would use garbage bags and old beach towels after nights of heavy partying. It worked okay but sometimes the towel would get bunched up and the pee would leak through to the mattress. This was especially a problem since we have a tempur-pedic mattress which soaks up your pee like a sponge. We were also sick of the crunchy noises the garbage bags would make during the night. Now we just put down the priva mattress before going out and no worries in the morning! If you are in a situation with simultaneous night-peers like us, I would recommend purchasing his and hers sheet protectors."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,12-19-11 Saw this product discussed on Dr. Oz. He stated that this product is a miracle natural skin healer. I had an ugly raised bur on my arm for over 20 years. Within one month of taking this product (4 caps 2/day) the burn scar has flattened and is disappearing. It also helped me heal a deep gash wound on my foot with a couple of weeks. People say that my skin glows and I think it is because of taking this product!!@

baby products,feeding,food,5.0,"I am really happy with this baby food mill. I've never used one before, but am a convert now! Initially, I found it difficult to use, but then I rubbed a little bit of vegetable oil on the gasket and this lubricated the gasket and made it MUCH easier. I've never had issues with leaks or explosions. I've put steamed carrots, peas, chicken, rice, steamed squash and banana through it and it has handled all of them well. It makes me feel good to know that I can control exactly what goes into my child's food. Very happy with the quality of the product for the price paid - highly recommend."

I love the bright colors. Plus, I have a high table w/ bar height chairs and this works great when I attach it to the chair.Definately recommend. It's is easy to store, easy to take along anywhere, and has some really neat features. The first one I received the right arm was loose, but Amazon took it back and sent me a new one free of charge."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"There is few dollar of difference between refined and unrefined. I only cook with extra virgin olive oil since the mono to poly unsaturated oil is 7 compare to almond 4.1 and coconut 3.2. Applying heat to poly-unsaturated fat creates unhealthy factors compared to mono-unsaturated fats. Now, once in a while it is fine for me if the oil is becoming rancid to use as cooking oil and consume before the 6 months window before the nut oil going rancid but on regular basis it is not a good idea. There is two type of nut oil, and unlike one reviewer who puts PHD next to her name and misinforms, refined is an oil that is missing some characteristics of the nut like smell and taste and for that reason you can apply more heat to refined since it is missing certain ingredients which can burn during cooking and create unpleasant conditions. Not having smell has nothing to do with organic or conventional seed. Coconut is the healthiest of all but it is like a cream not a lotion so I use coconut oil for hands and feet. Any nut oil should be good enough that you can consume it raw or use it in cooking and Spectrum is the better one since it really is sold all over right next to all other cooking oils instead of health section. I like Spectrum because of the glass container."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Several years ago I would catch a cold, would think it would go away...only to have it get worse.Often it turned into an infection and then I'd need to take antibiotics. I was feeling miserable too often. Winter, Summer, it didn't matter.Then, a friend told me about Oreganol. At the first sign of a tiny sore throat, or if I've been exposed to a sneezing person or 'runny nosed' kids...i get out the Oreganol. I have not had a cold since. It's been almost two years now. I'm not a scientist, but I am convinced that this product has made all the difference."

We were very happy to have found it at Amazon.Same performer and outstanding prices for the product and shipping.
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"When I first heard of d-mannose, this is the product that I purchased at my local healthfood store. I was amazed that it could cure my Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) because I had been relying on anti-biotics for 30 years or so since my pelvis was crushed in an accident. The infections were getting more and more numerous over the years and the anti-biotics continued to mess me up with yeast infections and bowel problems, etc.Anyway, I found that this product cured the infections in very short order, in fact faster than the anti-biotics. I was amazed and since there are few if any side affects, I was grateful.However, I read a review on Amazon that said not to bother with the cranactin products because it was just the d-mannose that cured the infections. So, I figured they must be right and took straight d-mannose. It would not cure the infections. It kept me from getting really, really sick but it would not cure the infections. I figured that the d-mannose must have stopped working and started taking the anti-biotics again.Then when I was at the healthfood store, I bought some d-mannose with cranactin from Solaray. It cured my infection. So, I suppose for some people, the d-mannose might be enough, but if you have stubborn UTIs, try the d-mannose with cranactin. It just works better.You can get it in bulk here so that's good too."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"I bought this for my husband who is a huge toffee/butterscotch fan, but so far I have used most of them myself. The coffee itself is delicious - a rich, medium roast, but the added flavoring makes it a nice treat. You can taste subtle notes of chocolate; however, the primary flavor is a similar to butterscotch. Not necessarily a first thing in the morning kind of coffee, but definitely great as a late morning or afternoon treat."

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,2.0,"I like that these bowls have lids, it's great for storing food that wasn't finished.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,i am allergic to citric acid and get skin rashes and hives from it. Just a warning to those who are like me. The malic acid in this supplement made my stomach very sick and then i broke out in hives. I honestly had no idea what malic acid was. I can't say how this product worked for my Fibromyalgia due to the fact i have only taken 3 pills total before i was forced to discontinue. I'm very sad about that after reading the great reviews on this product.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I got a variety pack of these bars, and double chocolate was the only flavor that was remotely edible.It has the best protein:sugar ratio, although I think Cliff Builder bars are WAY better tasting (but have comparable sugar, less protein). I get both so I don't get bored of one thing."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"In researching dandelion root, I came across a lot of different, sometimes contradictory claims, none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research. I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect, and it is supposedly good for the liver. Again, those claims may be dubious, but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason (caffeine, acid). It tasted terrible to me at first, but after about 4 cups I really started to like it. I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes. Now it basically tastes like coffee to me (note that I'm more of a tea drinker, however)."

What I like most about this drink is that it provided 25% of DV = Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet per serving (8fl oz)= one bottle. And nutrition to help get strong on the inside."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,condiments,5.0,"Branston Pickle is basically the UK's version of our sweet relish. It's chunkier and brown, due to ground raisins and spices being in it. It is also called ""Ploughman's Pickle"" and is an integral part of a traditional ""ploughman's lunch."" That consisted of a thick slice of bread with a slab of cheddar and a thick slice of onion that farmers would wrap up to take with them in the field. When it was time to eat, they'd pull out a jar of Branston Pickle to top it with. There is nothing better IMHO than an open faced sandwich with Branston Pickle, aged cheddar and fresh tomato slices, broiled until bubbly. Yum!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I started working nights a few months ago, and was terrified I wouldn't be able to sleep during the day. A friend of mine who works nights recommended them to me. I love these. They are light weight and silky feeling so I dont feel like they are smothering my face. You can adjust the strap so I can wear my hair however I want to when I have these on. They do a great job keeping the light out!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working, I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,Best tasting protein bars!! This flavor is the best too. It tastes more like a candy bar then a protein bar. Highly recommend! I eat one for breakfast every morning and its great dipped in coffee. = )
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Pros:Delicious (I've only tried extreme milk chocolate)Easy to mixDoesn't cause stomach crampsOver the past couple of years I have tried many types of protein powders from EAS, Muscle Milk, and other ones that I don't even remember the name that were on sale. This by far is the best tasting, less filling, and easiest to mix out of every other protein I've tried. I hate when other proteins give me stomach cramps because it feels like I just ate 5 plate at a super buffet and they don't even have nearly as many grams of protein in them. Other proteins are hard to mix and get chunky and lumpy at the bottom but this powder is so fine that it is as smooth as milk.As I said I've tried many protein brands in the past couple of years and usually I am open to try something new and I get bored with my current protein. I used to not stay with the same protein for more than a few months but I've been on this protein for about 6 months and I don't plan on changing for a long time. I did recently switch to the natural version of this protein because it is only a couple of dollars more. I am going to start using other proteins in my diet like casein and hydrobuilder; I am not going with any other brand than ON!"

Still a good price here you may want to check your local Wal Mart though if you're concerned about colors."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"This was supposed to be a ""Sunbeam Health at Home"" heating pad. The one I got was called ""Soft Heat soothing therapy."" I wouldn't have minded a substitution except this is horrible. There are 3 heat settings and only a one button to control all of it, including the on/off function. I press the button to turn it on and to scroll from low to medium to high. I don't mind that, but because the main button is used to scroll through the settings, there is no OFF setting! It goes low, medium, high, and back to low, instead of going to off. There isn't even any WAY to turn it off, except by unplugging it.The instructions say that if the pad has gone to the auto-shut off, I should press the power button to turn it off, then select the heat setting I want. Yet, the power button does NOT turn it on or off once it has auto shut down (or ever). I have to unplug it, then plug it back in. Also, mine starts to heat up then goes immediately into auto shut down without even getting warm.Perhaps mine is defective, but either way, I will be returning this and will NOT buy the same kind again. Even if it did work as stated, it isn't as good a design as the one I have at home (this one is for at work)."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"The most disappointing thing is the failure to show the actual elemental magnesium in the pills. I think it is deceptive to put 500 mg Magnesium Gluconate up front on the label, make it difficult to see the ingredients list and then into the bargain leave the consumer to figure out that two tablets have ?64 mg elemental magnesium/14% daily value - 32 mg Magnesium Gluconate per tablet."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I started using this about three months ago. I am one those folks that can eat and exercise like crazy but cannot gain weight. Moreover, the more i pushed myself the longer it took me to recover as i would have tremendous muscle aches for next two days depending on how often i was at the gym. This not only made it hard for me to go to the gym often, but also diverted all my energy to just recover.I randomly picked this product with out a lot of research and I am happy with it. The lemon lime works just fine. Honestly, i dont feel like i have been at the gym anymore as I dont have the usual aches anymore. I am putting on the muscle at an extremely slow pace, but that was to be expected. Now, i dont think twice about doing weights or running for more than 20 mins everyday. This thing works!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"This machine was given to us as a gift for Christmas, and I had seen it on TV once but honestly didn't think much of it. There are many claims of what this machine can do for you, but none that I could actually find officially documented in detail anywhere online besides on sites that sell various Chi machines. I consider myself quite open to alternative medicine and healing, so I figured I'd give it a try. My husband has back problems from work so supposedly this would assist (among many things) with back issues. He's been trying it for a few days now, once a day for about 15 minutes and so far he's felt that it's helped his back pain a bit and helps him to relax so he plans on continuing to use it. As far as I go, I've been using it 2 times a day for about 10-15 minutes per session. I don't have any back pain or any body pain, but I do have anxiety and sleep issues. I've been looking into meditation for my anxiety but I always find it extremely hard to calm my brain down and just breathe. With this machine though, I've found it extremely easy to calm down and clear my brain. The motion of the machine and the noise just seems to help me tune out and completely relax..that's definitely a huge benefit to me. I have also been sleeping better lately which is another big plus. So while I'm not sure if it will help me align my chi, lose weight, boost my immune system and cure any ailments I may have, I know that it definitely helps me reduce stress so far and that is huge. I have found that it's best to use the machine in a quiet room without distraction. This machine has variable speed settings and while I hear it's beneficial to use it at a speed where your whole body is actually moving, you should use it at whatever speed you feel is comfortable to you. The manual advises to start off no longer than 5 minutes for the first week (though for the first day or 2 we tried this and found that going up to 10-15 min was just fine for us), and after any session you should lay still for at least 2-5 minutes to maximize the benefits of the machine. Drink a glass of water when you get up to flush toxins out and that's about it. I'll continue to use the machine and hope it continues to help us."

It has a nice fresh pleasant taste which makes for a good thirst quencher. I enjoyed it.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"My orthopedic surgeon told me he has had a lot of success with this particular product and for me to start taking it. While reviewing the product description and trying to find information on the ingredients I saw KidIdaho's review and his remark about the Titanium Dioxide as well as the link to view the California Proposition 65 Warning, which entitles California consumers to special warnings for products that contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels. I did an internet search hoping to view the actual product label which I found on the NOW website, but was unable to see where this product contained the Titanium Dioxide. I would like to watch for this particular ingredient so that I can avoid taking it if possible, as it is one of the top fifty chemicals produced world wide and a known carcinogen (a substance that causes a cellular malfunction, causing the cell to become cancerous and thus potentially lethal to the surrounding tissue). Does anyone know if Titanium Dioxide is listed on product labels by a different name? If it is in this product why doesn't it show it on the label? How can I make sure I don't take it in other products?"

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"Beanpod candles are nice. Try them and you will see they have a smooth burn and nice aroma. I tried the automatic shipment program with Amazon.com thinking I could get a different candle fragrance each month, but I could find no way to do this at this time I am writing this. Pricing on Amazon.com is good. I would have paid more in a physical store paying the sales tax than I would buying the candle and paying the shipping charge. I know, I tried and it would have cost over $25 in a store for the 25oz size. Yankee Candles I used for about a year, but the Beanpod candle is just better in all aspects and on Amazon.com is much cheaper than buying in a physical store."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I bought a box of this tea after I had to go back to work and my baby was refusing the few bottles of formula he had to take while I was away. I was pumping but was not getting enough milk, with my first child I had tried the fenugreek and it worked but this time around I didn't want to be having to take pills all day. I saw this at the Walmart while I was out one day I picked up a box and I want to say that within two days of drinking it three times a day I had more than enough milk. The taste does not bother me and I enjoy drinking tea if this is a hassle for you maybe the fenugreek is a better option. I plan to keep drinking it as long as I nurse that way I can keep baby exclusively on breast milk for a few more months. I do think that other things along with the tea help like nursing and pumping more often so its not a miracle worker on its own but I do recommend it for anyone who is looking for something to give their supply a little bump."

health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"After my 3 year old son had tubes put in his ears, we were told to keep water out of them for a few months. The other earplugs didn't help much and would keep popping out during bath time. Those that stayed in longer were also more painful to put in. These, however, worked incredibly well. The putty is soft, yet firm enough, to stay in place without getting lodged in his ear canal. Due to the softness, the material forms a perfect seal and does not let water in. The best part is that these can be reused over and over again (just be sure to rinse them out after each use) and do not harden or lose their ability to stay in place. They work even in the swimming pool. The only ""problem"" I've had is that the bright colors attract his 1 year old sister and she wants to keep pulling them out of his ear. :)Would strongly recommend these for anyone who's looking for effective earplugs for their children. These would probably work just as well in adults too."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"I love these bottles! As a first time mom, I was very new in choosing bottles but I did know, I wanted the curving style. These were also recommended by a friend. Dishwasher safe! I do both depending on if it's a night my dishwasher needs more stuff to fill up with. My son is 3 months and have been using these since day 1 and no appearance of too much wear or anything.I like and dislike the many pieces. Like because I know for sure all that the bottle itself gets very clean down at the bottom as well. but dislike because of the hassle of all the parts, but because of the good cleaning it gets, doesn't bother me too much.Never had a problem with nipple collapsing or leaking as long as you have the parts screwed on correctly.I had two bottle warmers because the first one I thought was just the brand, and ended up returning both of them because I figured out it was because of the bottoms. We have since just stuck with room-temp water and my son doesn't mind it at all.I have no reason to turn to another brand (decided to try the evenflo curved ones and that was a fail!) so I will stick with these for my future children as well."

I highly recommend this to anyone doing a low carb diet as a supplement."

I usually have mine blended with fresh banana and blueberries and some nonfat vanilla yogurt (w vanilla variety shake) and it is like a decadent smoothie. But if i don't have the extras on hand, I can take it with just water. Not as good that way but just as nutritious.Bought the first can at Whole foods. Will be back here for next round. Much cheaper here."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I had no idea what to expect from these pills. Young barley was recommended to me for other reasons but I chose this product instead of just taking a barley supplement. Now, it is a normal part of my diet and I hate to go without it, which I have to sometimes because I live overseas and the mail can be unpredictable. I've tried several other pills for daily greens. They do not come close! Do yourself a favor... ignore negative comments on this product (please no offense to anyone) and try this! I was able to tell the difference as soon as I started taking these. Oh and a little background on me. I take my health very seriously and I workout at least 5 times a week whether I am training or not. When I am in training for an event that will be extremely phyically challenging, I push my body to the limit and I rely on my diet and the vitamins that I take to give my body what it needs to go!

An avid herb gardner, I thought - ""Well, I'll try it.""The flavor is great and if I double up the tea bags per cup, I get quite an energy boost in the afternoon. However,trouble came when every local store stopped stocking this great tea. So happy to find it on Amazon - you came through again!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,puffed snacks,4.0,"We love the Pirate's Booty products and buy Veggie Booty, Tings and Pirate's Booty in bulk to save money, since it's only available at a few stores where we live and it's expensive out here. My only complaint is that the last box we bought, we stored up in our pantry with only that front cardboard part pulled out, and just grabbed a new bag when we needed one. I went to pull the box down today and discovered that 2 bags had opened at the top seam (or more likely had never properly been closed) and so had to throw them away. That bums me out, and it raised the overall cost of the remaining 10 bags about 50 cents each. Since I ordered the box over a month ago, I don't feel like I can request a refund, so my only advice is when you get your bulk package, don't just open the cardboard cutout and store it. Be sure to go through and inspect each bag for any problems. That way you can contact Amazon and get a replacement if there is something wrong. Otherwise, I highly recommend these products at healthy alternatives for snacking kids (and adults)."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Very sweet that takes getting used to and amount to be used, but the price so under cuts the other yellow package sweetener, any inconvenience or mild taste differential is not worth spending on the Splendid brand.I wouldnt bake with it as another customer noted, despite what the box suggests, the taste is not a substitute for sugar etc."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I take this before bed and it seems to help me sleep better. I have heard very good things about 5HTP. Because it works on seratonin, your stomach may be queasy for a couple of days but it usually subsides.This brand seems good and i will get it again.I haven't experienced weight loss with it, but I'm hoping it will be helfpul. I am not sure if it is helping with hot flashes because I also take bioidentical hormones to help with hot flashes.Overall, it seems like a good product with little downside--so i figure, give it a try and see if you get any of the benefits and if not, then stop taking it. For things like depression you may need to take 4-6 weeks before full benefit is reached."

I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices, the 690 is accurate, fast and reliable. It also has a history, which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while, don't bother with this, but if you even have to take it weekly, I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"A friend of mine purchased this product and put a picture of herself on facebook and I saw how well it worked for her. Of course I bought it and just after 3 weeks i've notice i lost inches more than pounds during my first 2 weeks. Which is good because I can fit into a size smaller that what I normally wear and my belly doesn't look as big as it had before. Yea it keeps you going to the washroom, so it would be best not to take it the day your know your going to be out and about if you don't like to use public washrooms. I do give my body a break for like a week but I try not to eat as much during that week off as well. I would recommend this product to anyone that is willing to loose weight but can't stop eatting that good food. To see fast results I would recommend working out while taking it as well. I've started going to the gym and notice now i'm loosing pounds as well."

health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"I love this thing, and always recommend it to all of my new-mom friends.It has less suction than the hospital aspirator, but the hospital one doesn't remove much if you can't get it up your child's nose. My child would squirm and fight and cry when the hospital bulb came out. I'd worry about poking my child's eye out with all the fighting and squirming. With this, my child would stay still, and sometimes try to put it in his nose himself - it's that much more comfortable. And since it's shorter from bulb to tip, I feel that I have better control getting that tip in.I *love* the clear tip - so I can see how much or little has been suctioned out - and I love the fact that I can take it apart and clean it. We've had ours for 2 years and it's still working great! I'm here because I was looking up the link to give to another mommy friend."

health personal care,health care,women s health,4.0,"Well I have had yeast infections with my two previous pregnancies and my doctor said it was safe to take Monistat for them. In the past I have bought Monistat 3, but now pregnancy #3 I yet again have another one and I wanted it over with quickly and easily. Obviously if you have irritated red almost raw infected skin its going to burn, plus its on a tender delicate area. You insert the ovule and when the medication begins to seep out of it you will start to feel the burning and itching (which you have to begin with so what's the big deal) My way of thinking about it is like pouring alcohol on a wound, it will burn for a bit but then it gets better after that. If you can handle the not so severe symptoms as people describe just for a while It's worth it. I've used it before and will continue to.There is a reason it is the best, because it is quick and effective. There is no magic ointment to rub on and tada it's gone. If you prefer the all natural effective treatment I would use garlic. Peel a clove slice some slits on it or cut in half for a more potent treatment thread a string on it and place fresh one up there every night until it clears up. Proven effective but causes you to taste garlic in your mouth for some reason."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I am not for or against alternative remedies but I am into feeling better fast when I am sick and not having to deal with side effects.This tea tastes pretty good, and is excellent with honey. When I come down with a cold, or feel it approaching, I usually drink about 4 cups of this tea in a single day and the cold is averted or my symptoms disappear. The best part is it does not make me drowsy or have any other side effects for me. That I like.Highly recommended for anyone looking for side effect-free cold solutions."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,Clif Bars have gone from one of my favorite energy bars to one of my least favorite due to a recipe change.I contacted them about this and they told me that they knew about the issue and I shouldn't worry- they would be going back soon.That was many months ago and I just tested them again- same story. Now more than the chocolate chip bars taste sour- the peanut butter and peanut butter and chocolate are the same.I am unwilling to buy from them again- they offered to ship me a replacement sample and never went through with it. Too bad I have 20 useless bars to get rid of now.Before all this- I would have given them a 4/5 or 5/5 as I really liked them.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Before I bought this I read all the reviews and they are all pretty accurate. It's a great product. I take 1.5 tsp twice a day once in the morning and once at night. It helped me sleep better, it made going to the bathroom easier, I wasn't craving junk food as much as usual (I'm usually pretty healthy about what I eat), and I just felt better in general. Great product I would give it 10 stars if I could!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Day 1I did this the day after New Years. I was still a bit hungover and I ate a ton of not so healthy meals the day before. But day one wasn't too bad. I was just getting over food poisoning and I was mentally prepared to go through it. The pills are HUGE. Enough to feel like they were actual meals! The fiber drink was absolutely DISGUSTING the first time I tried it and wondered if I could even manage the whole kit without wanting to puke.Day 2At this point, I looked forward to the fiber drink. Which was pretty sad, but I knew in the end it would be good. My energy level was the same. I did do some light gym work on the first and second days, but I knew if I would not last if I kept it up so after the second day I stopped. I have been only drinking water and herbal teas for the first two days on this cleanse. Still wasn't going to the bathroom to flush out, so I took an entra colon clear that evening.Day 3The most challenging day for myself. No energy what-so-ever. It was an absolute struggle to get out of bed and getting ready for work. I picked up some pressed carrot juice and after a glass (mixed with fiber), I was back in the game. I realized that my blood sugar must have been low. This was the day I finally ""flushed"" everything out of my system...oddly, I continued to do so everytime I would have to relieve myself in the restroom. Decided to stick to the juice every morning and night.Day 4Feeling better, energy is higher. Although, I don't know why I tortured myself with watching the Food Network during my entire fast.Day 5AMAZING. My energy level was similar to when I drink cups and cups of coffee. But the best part, it was a natural energy. I made myself a smoothie with apples, spinach, cucumbers and blueberries that evening. I wanted to reintroduce myself to food in a safer way.In conclusion, I am glad I did this cleanse. I am an lacto-ovo vegetarian, so I normally eat clean. But during the holidays I went a little crazy with eating a lot of sugary and processed foods. I ate whatever cookie and sweets were around. Then I got food poisoning on Christmas which ruined me. I knew that if I completed this kit, I would get back to my old clean eating habits.I am going to continue to eat clean and raw for a couple of weeks and reintroduce dairy into my diet slowly. Overall, an amazing cleanse and I encourage anyone to try it. It's challenging, but in the end, it's all worth it. Oh yeah, I lost 7.5 lbs!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been taking this product (niacin 500mg sustained release tablets, Now brand) for over 20 years. I started it when my cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL became abnormal, increasing my risk for coronary and other artery disease. I had been told about niacin by another physician (I am a physician) a few years earlier because that's what he was doing and it was working for him. He is still alive at about the age of 90. I am now 63. The pharmacology texts describe this vitamin's beneficial effects on lipid profiles and reducing the development of atherosclerosis, and I initially learned about it in medical school.Please read this whole review to see how to minimize the flushing that nearly everyone gets from niacin.I had learned that I would need to start with a low dose and gradually increase it to 2 to 3 gms per day. Even with that, there were some episodes of mild flushing when I started and with each increase of dosage, which is not surprising. The flushing wasn't noticeable by others, just me. I actually found it kind of interesting and stimulating. So, if you want to want to normalize your lipid profile at a low cost and avoid the potential side effects of the much more expensive presciption medications, please follow these directions.1. Start at 250 or 500 mg per day. You may take 5gr (325mg) of aspirin 30 minutes before your niacin dose to reduce flushing.2. Once you are no longer experiencing flushing at your current dose, usually after a few days to a week or two, increase your dose by 250 or 500 mg, and stay at that level until you are no longer experiencing flushing, eventually reaching 2000mg (four tablet of 500mg)per day.3. Have your lipid profile checked again after you have been on 2000 per day for a few weeks, and if it is not yet normal, continue the above procedure to increase to 3000mg (six tablets of 500mg) per day. Check your lipid profile again after a few weeks at that dose. It should now be normal or close to normal. If it is not, you are not going to respond to niacin, and should try the prescription meds.My results (granted, this is anecdotal, but not atypical):My lipid profile normalized at 2000mg per day, and has stayed that way ever since, with greatly reduced total and LDL cholesterol, greatly reduced triglycerides, and significantly increased HDL. My personal physician has been amazed, considering that my levels were so abnormal before I started, the fact that my father had severe lipid abnormalities and died at age 66 of coronary disease, and that I have a great liking for all the wrong foods.To cap this off, I underwent a pre-operative cardiac catheterization a few years ago, and my coronary arteries were COMPLETELY CLEAR, without any signs of atherosclerosis. I have no reason to doubt that they have remained that way, and my peripheral pulses are full and bounding, like they were when I was in my 20s.On another note, I believe that niacin has actually been shown to reduce atherosclerotic plaques in those persons who have already developed them.So, please do your own research from reliable medical and pharmacological texts and articles, don't believe the bum raps from people who didn't use the above procedure, and give it a try. It just may extend your life.By the way, don't use the ""flush-free"" capsules, because they don't seem to improve the lipid profile the way that the sustained release tablets do."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This tea has so much flavor, its so wonderful. And I love the sayings on the tea bag. Such a nice treat after a long day with little ones. I looked at the ingredients several times, there are no artifical flavors, so not sure what the other reviews are taking about. I really really enjoy this tea, and I use a natural sweetener, Stevia to sweeten. I normally do not like the Stevia due to a bit of an aftertaste, but in this tea, it works excellent. Such a wonderful cup of tea, and I am picky about my teas."

Even though the Dr. Brown bottle brush didn't hold up as well as I would've liked and is more money, I still liked it better than the Munchkins one because that one is just too rigid and tough but that's my personal preference."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I agree with C. Wright! This thing is all levels of nasty. I bought this thinking I'd get the flavor of regular green tea with added lemon and honey but nooooo doesn't taste anything like it. If you read the ingredients it doesn't even mention honey or lemon (lemon grass doesn't count). Not sure how to describe the taste but it's very strong and herby. Better stick to the regular green tea and just add lemon and honey yourself. I had to hold my nose drinking it cuz I didn't want to waste the cup of it I made. But in short, DON'T BUY IT!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"If you want something that doesn't pack the calories and leaves you satisfied, this is it. I have used it for years. One thing though...if you use it to bake, and can have sugar, I would recommend doing 1/2 sugar twin and 1/2 sugar. In other words, if something calls for two cups of sugar....use one cup sugar twin and one cup sugar. I have found that if I use all sugar twin, I am not as happy with the texture. Things do not seem to rise as well (more dense). I hate it that I can't pick this up at the store anymore, but was glad to see that they are not out of business and that it is still available. When I use splenda my ankles swell and my joints hurt. I dont have any of those problems with this product."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Love the Chillow...having night hot flashes makes sleep difficult, but the chillow will cool you down quickly and lets you sleep without overheating. At first it feels pretty cold, but you quickly appreciate how it cools you down. I put some white vinegar in it along w/the water since we have well water to avoid any mold growth. I check the plug every night to make sure it is sealed well, so far no leakage. Would recommend to anyone that has hot flash/night sweat issues."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I'm going to go ahead and say that we love these sippy cups -- they work great for us. We have been Born Free fans since the very beginning of bottle use. So it was a natural transition for us to use the sippys. All the parts are interchangeable with the bottles -- except the lids; if you use one of the bottle lids for the sippy, you'll have leakage into the bottle cap, if the bottle is getting tossed around in your bag or whatever. The flow is good for a bigger kiddo -- it would have been way to fast for my kiddo at 6, or even 9, months. But now, at 16 months (we started using them at a year), they are all I really like to use. They don't leak when being used for us, ever. A winner in my book!"

Yippee! It is unobtrusive, stores easily, and used half an hour when I get up, made it easy to adjust to a new routine. I felt the price was reasonable and the quality of the light appears to be just fine,as well"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I have used one of these neck pillows and find them very effective. I have given them as gifts and each person loved them. They are very comforting and relaxing. When warmed they make you feel so relaxed and does a great job in comforting you -- you actually go to sleep. Great product and I would definetly recommend this to everyone who needs that special moment of relaxation.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"As long as I can remember, my family had one of these massagers. I started using it when I got older and it was useful as you don't need any battery.

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"The table is nice. Like the size, heat, portability. The arm rest is designed poorly as it makes Velcro noise and tilts as one arm is removed thus disturbing the client. You will end up not using it. The vendor and company and Amazon really disappointed me in the sales process. The CD's were not shipped with the order. How hard can it be to just send me some CD's? They are ""investigating"". Sound like a scam. If you want one of these table, expect to be happy with the table, disappointed in the sales process and the arm rest. Good luck."

health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because I am a neutral party.This product might work for you I don't know- each human body is different. I myself am leary of spending this kind of cash on something that is ""unreturnable"" for things like canker sores. Perhaps it will work for the other types of herpes breakouts.I combat kankers and fever blisters like crazy- cold sores used to be common for me. I find that stress brings it out. For those of you that are like me. I found that Hylands cold sore and fever blister tablets are a miracle. Kankers and cold sores typicaly last for about 14 days- shorter if you are lucky. I place the quick dissolving tablet on the sore and let it melt there. you might want to make a paste for external blisters. You'll want to swallow 2-3 the first time then follow up with one tablet- three times a day (more frequently if you have severe cases), until the pain is gone. Mine dissapear in 48 hours. NO joke.Also Goldenseal is a good herbal rememdy that combats the Herpes virus. TAKE FOR NO LONGER THAN 10 DAYS IN A ROW then rest for at least 2 weeks. I also suggest this in capsule form- the liquid is detestable, unless you are simply using it as a topical solution. Hope this helps someone :)"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"Just got this today. I don't know why but heating pads these days don't generate much heat. I got one at CVS and after setting it to *high* as a test it took forever and the heat was what I would expect on low. Took it back, got my money back and got this one from Amazon. Same thing. The heat is a little higher but not much. We need one for my elderly mother and will settle for it for now. I'm not saying don't buy this one. Just be prepared to wait a year for the heat to come and don't expect the pad's *high* to be the standard version of high. If anyone out there knows of a better version PLEASE let me know."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,4.0,"I purchased these over the counter for more $ and less tablets. This was following a dx of IC and no relief from prescriptions, bladder instillations, and diet modification. Definitely worth purchasing on amazon- more tabs, less $, quick shipping. I take 2 at bedtime and before any questionable stuff ( sweetener, coffee, tomato based stuff). I would say the biggest difference for me is decreased trips to urinate at night (now down to 2 from 4 or 5) plus I don't feel I have to run. I also no longer have dreams where I had to pee, so I'm guessing my bladder is feeling better! Next time I get a uti I plan to take them right away to see if they help prevent a flare. I've also had some relief from daily Zyrtec and Zantac twice daily. Glad I found this product! I'll keep it on my cupboard from now on. Thanks for offering this product, wish I knew about this years ago!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,party mix,5.0,"I use this after a gym workout, at that moment when my energy is waning and I am getting a blood sugar drop, before reaching food!!! It is the perfect taste and consistency. A Clif Bar is too much work and too filling for those times. I can't stand the gels. I have also used this before a workout, for a quick booster. I use it for outside sports, too, including swimming, skiing, runs, etc.I also let my 3-year old daughter have some when she is very hungry and for some reason food is delayed. She loves it and I always have to fight off demands for more! :)I usually get the Cran-Razz flavor. Note - the Black Cherry flavor contains caffeine, in case you are also passing it on to kids! I don't like the Strawberry flavor at all. Another one I recently tried is Mountain Berry.I can find it in some local stores, it's a hit or miss..."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola trail mix bars,5.0,"I just received these bars and inhaled one in about a nanosecond, that's how good they are. Also I guess I'm a bit perplexed by the comments on how hard they are. It clearly says they are ""crunchy"", which they are, but are no crunchier than the ""Nature Valley Oats and Honey"" bars that I am also a fan of. They are crunchy because they don't have all the fat in them so it's a great pay-off as far as I'm concerned. I couldn't be happier, they are a quick, easy, healthy snack. YUM!"
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I have been using this product for quite some time, but paying more for it.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I am a SAHM, so while I don't need to pump multiple times a day, I do need to be able to pump some so that I can run errands, spend time alone with my daughter, etc. For the first 4 weeks, I didn't have a pump or use bottles, and the 2 hour time restriction was just too stressful. I decided to get a pump, and originally was planning on a double electric. I was looking at the Medela Freestyle, which I decided quickly was ""overkill"" for what I needed. I then narrowed it down to a few other double electrics in the $75-150 range. Then, on a whim, I read reviews for this one. I figured I'd try it, and if it was slow and uncomfortable, I would just keep it as a bake up for an electric one. Well, needless to say, I never bought the electric one. This little manual pump is a workhorse! I now pump once a day, in the mornings, for my ""just in case"" freezer supply. I can fill the bottle up (about 5.5 oz) in less than 10 minutes (I get 3.5ish in the first 5)! My son is almost 6 weeks old, and this is more than he can even usually drink in one sitting! Granted, in the morning you're always pretty full, and I've never had supply issues so I'm sure it varies by person. It also doesn't hurt my hand at all, like I was worried about. I think dragging out an electric pump with all the tubing and parts would be a bigger pain than it was worth, when this thing works so well. I don't think you'd wanna use it for exclusive pumping (although, I guess it depends on it's efficiency for you) but using it a few times a day would definitely be doable. Highly recommend!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"My experience with BSN products has always been positive. This is true whether you are using one or stacking with others and there is no better place to buy this stuff than Amazon (especially if you are a Prime Member). As some reviewers say, ""I don't write product reviews"" and I am no different. However there are not many reviews so I feel compelled to share my experiences.I run on average of 40 miles per week, not including about 6 hours of strength training. Thus I consider myself an intense trainer. That said, this stuff will seriously ignite your body like no other thermogenic or vascodialater. This gives you the energy and push to start your workout and carry you through for quite sometime. I do notice that it starts to wear off about two hours into a run or workout, but most people do not exercise that long. Some say that when it wears off you get a ""crash."" I do not notice this at all yet there is a difference between 30 minutes after you take the product and 150 minutes. If there wasn't a difference in these times, why would you purchase the product? There would be no need.You can tell that there is caffeine in the product, so I wouldn't use if you are very sensitive to caffeine. There is a no caffeine version of this same product however, I have not tried that version so I am unsure if it is just as effective. Other than the vascodialater there is different types of creatine which is one of the only products proven over and over again to increase strength. So there are many reasons to buy this stuff.As always, you should remember to cycle on and off, if you do not then your body will become dependent upon it. Thus if you continue to take it, you'd just be wasting your money.I have read other reviews as of writing this and despite some of the negative things people had to say, I do not agree. I have nothing negative to say about this product. If you want to work out longer, lose weight, increase strength, or all of the above, THIS product may be right for you!"

grocery gourmet food,snack food,nuts seeds,5.0,"I've been using this product (Hodgson Mill brand) for about 3 years. Smells good and never takes away from the taste of my foods. I first learned of flaxseed by reading an article about an African-American actor/physical trainer who swears by it. She stated she uses it every day, at least one tablespoon in her cereal and recommends it for everyone. This is some good stuff...and this company is wonderful."

baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,3.0,"We have two Grandchildren under the age of 2 why we purchased the booster. (we already had a high chair) This works fine, but would not want to use this daily. Felt safe only the tray does not come off easy like our high chair. Great for the price and what we are using it for. Like a standard high chair better. What is nice this packs up easy and in storage waiting for my Grandchildren's arrival again."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am an asthmatic and since I have started taking this type of vitamin C, I have not had asthma. It is easy to take and it helps ward off colds if you take 4 or 5 packets the minute you feel like you are catching a cold. It is expensive, but cheaper than going to the doctor."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I knew the 24mm size breastshields that came with my pump weren't fitting me properly, so I purchased the next size of 27mm. They work great! Easy to assemble, use and clean. Amazon had them for much cheaper than the retail store."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,3.0,"I bought the Senokot simply out of curiosity, to see if the brand name product really improves on Sennna, its generic substitute. Sad to say, while it tastes better it does not seem to be more effective, leading to questions as to whether it's worth the extra money. On balance, I'd say not and hence my 3 rating. It's OK and I like it fine but not enough to buy it again."
health personal care,health care,allergy,3.0,"My office is rather dry and I seem to suffer from sinus infections most of the winter. Things got better when I had my tonsils removed and sinus surgery. However, this year has been awful. I use the Simply Sailine Nasal Mist and love it. So when I saw this ""artificial snot"" I had to try it. The concept seems great, so I thought I would use it at night before bed and while at work. Something in the ingredients irritates my nasal passages. I was using a q-tip to place some of the gel not very far in my nose. I would then close my mouth and take a breath in via my nose. I would get a burning sensation almost immediately. I ended up switching to the NeliMed ""artificial snot"" in a pump and I like that product much better. Plus it's somewhat less conspicuous to use in the office. Which is great since I work in an industry where any odd behavior noted by my boss or co-workers has to be noted and investigated, the last thing I want is to waste a day talking to a psychologist and the friendly people with guns."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"I have to say, this is by far my favorite coconut water~ taste great and does not taste like artificial flavored. it does not exactly the same as fresh coconut water, but what do you expect from a packaged beverage? I am going to keep buying these~"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,3.0,This GREEN Habanero sauce is quite potent. Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).Ingredients (as copied from the label)

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"These are exactly what I needed. I live in a house that is heated with a wood furnace and the house is kept around 12 degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) most of the time. By evening, when I am sitting quietly, my feet start to cool down, and by bedtime, they are like little blocks of ice. I found it so hard to go to sleep with such cold feet. Even with my hand knit wool or alpaca socks, they still got cold. I heat these at bedtime and slip them on before getting into bed. They are wonderfully warm and just the thing I need, and I fall asleep much more quickly as a result. They are not designed to be ""slippers"" for walking in - they are designed to be foot cozies! If you want something to warm your feet while you are sitting quietly or going to bed, these are the perfect thing."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I love this one! I've had issues with Syntha 6 making my stomach hurt but I haven't had any problems with this one. I'm a chocolate lover (especially dark chocolate) so the taste is a big deal for me. I tried with water and it was not very tasty at all! Second time around, I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk and it really helped. It's also pretty filling and it mixes pretty well with ice in a blender bottle."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I have a neck injury from an old auto accident, which sometimes causes muscles in my neck to cramp, resulting in a nasty all day headache. I have tried numerous remedies, including normal heating pads and the microwavable/reusable neck wraps. This heating pad is by far the BEST thing for my neck. Although I am not pain free, I no longer take ibuprofen as much as I used to. I highly...HIGHLY recommend this heating pad."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"My husband and I are planning on a baby soon so I wanted to take a pre natal that I could take once a day since I am horrible at remembering to take pills.. So far, the only problem I have had is constipation. Since I have had some prior issues, and this is not making it any better, I am a little concerned, but read some other reviews that suggested taking it every other day to help which I will do and increase water intake. As far as swallowing goes, I have to laugh at some people...if its that bad to swallow, take it in applesauce, or yogurt or something. I take it in applesauce, cant taste it, or feel it going down! I will also comment...it may give you some bad gas during the first week but that has since subsided. My poor husband LOL !!! good luck ladies =)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I bought this product and love the flavor. A great and relaxing way for me to end or begin a day.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,We boil some tri-color vegetable rotini add this soup to the drained pasta and add a large can of pre-cooked ckicken. Makes a tasty casserole. Add cheese as desired. Buying by the case saves $0.50-$0.75 per can over our local supermarket price. Sometimes I add more vegies too depending on how many are eating.
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,1.0,"10 years ago I had two different clip on high chairs for my kids, and I loved them (different brands from each other, and different from this one). I purchased this one for my sister in law with her new child. The distance between the top support pad and the bottom support pad is nearly zero! What table thickness does this chair fit? I can't imagine a table with zero thickness. I took the chair for its debut into a restaurant, which had five different table styles. It fit NONE of them. I don't even see how the chair fits on the table shown in the picture. I think this might be a case of a manufactured item leaving the factory without the specifications being checked by quality control. I am returning it. Of all the items I have purchased at Amazon, which are more than one hundred, I am returning something for the first time."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"CLA is great at what it does and that is aid in weight loss. I've only taken this product for 2 weeks and I've already lost 10lbs, of course that is with proper eating and exercising. I just take 1 pill after every meal.Another great thing about CLA is the way its packaged. It is simply bursting with pills - none of this 'fill the bottle halfway with pills and the other half with cotton' crap. You get your moneys worth."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I have used the regular Ocuvite tablets but decided to switch to the Adult 50+ because it has more leutin. So, I ordered three from an Amazon supplier. The first and second ones smelled of fish the minute I opened the packages; the third one reeked to the point I got a headache from the dead fish odor. I don't know if this is due to the Ocuvite 50+ having Omega3 or the way it was stored by the supplier. They were all within the ""use date"" stamped on the packages. So, no, I will not get them again."

health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,2.0,"Visit[...]It looks like the manufacturer has agreed to reimburse anyone who has purchased any of their magnetic products.Over the years, lots of people alleged that holding a magnet close to your body would improve your physical condition. Evidently, no one has been able to demonstrate that their product actually works as advertised. Usually one of the federal agencies or FDA handle situtations like this, but this time a legal firm took these unsubstantiated product claims to court, and the manufacturer evidentally can't show that they actually do anything, so after a hearing with the judge, they're going to give everyone a refund.Terms of the Class Action settlement are at the above link.But if you're needing help with pain or a skin disease or any other medical problem, look for a product that has had its claims verified through a FDA-approved testing facility. Otherwise, be prepared to throw your hard-earned money away on something that probably won't do what you need it to do.Good luck, and Best Wishes,"
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,1.0,I purchased this for 89 and 92 yr old couple the alarm was barley audible and I called e-pill to see if I had a defective one. They told me they had no complaints and put me on hold; when she came back she said I bought it on Amazon and to contact them to return it. She offered no help and would not accept that I might have a defective one. I had no problem with the seller just the manufacture VERY POOR customer service. I have returned this item
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,4.0,"Just opened the package. It's exactly what I needed. I tend to forget if I took a particular med even just after I took it cause I'm thinking about other things. Using this product, I will know exactly whether I took my meds that day or not. And it's an attractive product so I'll enjoy using it.In response to what another reviewer wrote, if you lean the open sections against an edge, they lay flat so that you can fill them easily. The only drawback is that when you open the individual section both the am and pm sections are open at once.This product looks like it will work just fine when I need to take my pills along somewhere. The sections snap shut and don't look as if they will open in my purse,(to be sure, I can always place them in a zip lock bag) and yet are easy to open so they won't bounce out upon opening.All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"This product definitely works. I lost six pounds in two days and could see my stomach flatten out almost immediately. I did the 3xday shake plan for the three days suggested with the hope that I would continue on to 2xday shake plan with a meal. I tried my best but I just couldn't stomach this shake. I tried everything to make it taste good. My best combo was 10 oz. unsweetened vanilla almond milk with coconut extract and cinnamon. I tried flaxseed but it was too bitter for my taste. I never looked forward to ""meal"" time and the smell made me nauseous. I did fairly well until the third day. It was late afternoon and I started to feel weak and just not right. I grabbed a small snack and felt better. I proceeded to drink my last shake of the day. Unfortunately, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling completely off. I was jittery and hungry. I went in the kitchen and grabbed a snack and immediately felt much better.Also, I never felt full like others have commented. I always had that underlying gnawing hunger that made my day uncomfortable. If you want to try this product, my suggestion is to buy only one container of this shake and make sure you can handle the taste. I would also recommend doing the three shake a day plan only for two days. You can re-evaluate and go from there. I will personally go back to Weight Watchers Points Plus which doesn't deprive you of real food and is extremely manageable.OK, it's now 3/21/12 and I wanted to update my review. Since my first review 3 months ago, I have not gained back one pound from the 6 lbs. that I lost with the Almased. I decided to give it another shot but changed up the ingredients and now don't think it tastes so bad. I use 10 oz of the 40 cal vanilla almond milk, 6 Tbs of Almased (that's the amt for my height), I add 2 Tbs on flax seed oil, 1 packet of Splenda, and pumpkin pie spice to taste. Oh my goodness, what a difference. It now doesn't taste so bad and the fact that I use all milk instead of a water/milk combo keeps me full longer. Another key is to make sure you mix it really good otherwise you'll have clumps of powder. I already lost 3 pounds on day one and hope to get through this time with no problems. Still not the best, but definitely worth trying."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I have been using Green Vibrance for five weeks now and I can say that I don't feel more energetic or healthier. In fact, the use of this product has actually interferred with my past complete vitamin program.In my opinion, Green Vibrance is an incomplete product. For example, the only ""B"" vitamin included is B12 and only at 44% daily value. What happened to the other ""B"" vitamins. One deletion that affects us all, especially men, is the exclusion of zinc. The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1. The manufacturer also omitted amino acids.The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D. This prevents someone from supplementing with a multi-vitamin because that would put A and D over the recommended dosages. The only way I see to have a balanced vitamin and mineral regimen while taking this product is to purchase individual Calcium and Magnesium, Zinc, and B complex vitamins. Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily? I'm not so sure I want that everyday. You can make up your own mind.For the price that this lists for (and thank heaven for Amazon's pricing) this should be a complete supplement,(of course with the exception of omega 3 fish oil).To be honest, I'm a little suspect of all the positive reviews."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,I was thrilled to receive my Heat Pad and took it away on holiday with me so that I could use it on my shoulder which had recently had a tendon repair. I needed it to help with pain relief. Imagine my great disappointment when I found the plug was not compatable in New Zealand. I would have thought knowing where the item is being sent and to be used that it would come ready to use for that country. I should have sent it back instead decided to take it to have a new plug put on so that I could use. Unfortunately for me the engineer that was to do the work removed the plug and prepared the wires for a replacement plug before he read the fact that it wasn't compatable for 240V. I now have a heat pad that is unusable and unreturnable due to the fact it is not in the original condition.I suggest everyone who is purchasing items that you check if it is compatable for your use in your country. That was my mistake

baby products,feeding,solid feeding,3.0,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter received this set as a Christmas gift. After reading a review on the 4 piece set where the paint was coming off, I was extra careful not to run these through the washer. Unfortunately I accidentally did, and sure enough, some paint came off. I made a point to hand wash after that incident, and recommend you do the same.My daughter absolutely loves the Minnie fork, and asks for her at every meal (not sure if this is good or bad). We've had the set for only 1 month. With daily use and hand washing, about 25% of the paint is gone.Note that there are different versions of the set. The one we got has Mickey on the spoon. If I reordered, I'd get Minnie on both. She doesn't get as excited about Mickey as she does Minnie. And yes, the spoon is very shallow. It's okay for scooping solids, but can get a little messy with any liquids (soup/applesauce). While the set is not perfect, it's still fun and worth buying at least once."

I will continue to buy this product from Amazon but wanted people to know this. Is it a fluke? I don't know...but it came as a complete shock to me. Such a shame!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"The first time I took this, using the recipe on the can w/almond milk, my energy levels felt *wonderful* and my cravings disappeared completely (amazing!). However, at that quantity and consistency it literally took me several hours to eat/drink. Because of that, I haven't managed to take it consistently - it ends up taking much more time than just eating normally.Because this is truly nutritionally excellent, I'm going to keep experimenting to find a practical way to fit it into my schedule"

The second time I ordered them, they tasted very stale, almost burnt. Absolutely disgusting. Normally, if something is not up to par I will at least eat it to prevent wasting, but these were so bad that I threw them out and considered calling amazon for a return, although I never took the time to do that. I just made the decision never to order them again."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"I love the flavor that permeates the air when this tea is brewing, but unfortunately the aroma oversells the taste.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have looked in to getting protein supplements for a while. When I saw this at first I hesitated because of the price. Although what I quickly came to realize is that it was worth it. I'm a huskier fellow so I added this to weight loss routine, with additional muscle building days. I didn't want something that was heavy on the calories such as the meal replacement variety, though this could also work as a meal replacement. Anyways, this product is very worth it, and if anything else is worth a try."

IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! it moisturizes like no other. i use it on my hair as a light deep conditioner. i put it on my hair before i wash my hair.like a hot oil treatment. i just let it marinate in my scalp and stuff. and then i wash my hair. it leaves it soooo soft and it even detangles!!! and it leaves my hair feeling strong and it is growing. but be careful if u use too much on ur hair it will become very very greasy and heavy. u only need a tad. okay next, i use it on my skin! i wash my face and i put it on my face afterwards. it leaves my face feeling extremely soft, clean and moisturized. also, it doesnt clog my pores. and once or twice a week i will do a soothing bath with the coconut oil. a warm bath mixed with the oil, is sooooo heavenly. Lol. Also use it when i shower too. it leaves my skin feeling soo soft. like i have eczema and it doesnt irritate it at all. my skin loves this stuff. it melts fast and the smell will takes some getting used to. i havent tried cooking with it yet because i really just wanted to use it on my skin cause i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema and i needed something pure and organic. and honestly, i can see my skin clearing up. my eczema is less itchy and actually looks better and is under control. coconut oil is so vital to my everyday skin care regimen. best thing ever."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"The EXACT thing happened to me this month! I also emailed them and was told it was backordered.Unfortunatley, I wasn't made aware of this problem while ordering. There are many other places to buy this product.If I had known the circumstances, I definitely would have gone elsewhere."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"My first Protein drink and its not a disappointment!recommended by my trainer. I bought the vanilla ice cream and i like to mix it with milk, although there will still be lumps of the powder, it doesn't bother me that much since the powder taste normal milk powder.will buy again, perhaps another flavor."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"This Himalayan salt has made us very happy. We miss it when we dine out. My husband is quite a good cook, and now -- with this delicate pink salt -- probably better than anyone he watches on the foodie channels."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I purchased this a couple years ago & only used it a few times because it made my stool very watery (of course was drinking lots of water at the time). The end of last year I was doing some heavy duty studying so I was drinking lots of coffee, caffeine energy drinks, diet sodas, taking Excedrin almost every day, etc. My eating was atrocious...lots of fast foods, processed foods, and sugary sweets and to top it off I was barely drinking any water. This went on for about 3 months.When I decided to start eating healthy & lose some weight, although I rehydrated myself (drinking at least a gallon of water a day), I still wasn't losing the weight I should have, my stomach was constantly bloated, & I was barely going to the bathroom. I tried metamucil bars which worked a little, then I tried psyllium husks which also worked a little. I tried senna capsules & that barely worked, even an enema barely produced results. At first I thought ""maybe I'm not backed up"" but I wasn't going hardly at all...I would get the urge but then...nothing.I then began taking 3 Mag 07 in the evening & let me tell you...things are REALLY moving now! Not just water either like before! This is a stool softener so don't expect your stool to come out formed, but this worked when NOTHING else did. I'm going to keep taking 3-4 every evening for the next 5-7 days as recommended on the bottle as a cleanse. HIGHLY recommend this...no cramping & very predictable. I've been taking it at 11pm & by 4 or 5am I have to go.UPDATE- MARCH 17, 2012"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,I have been using this product for a month on my hair and I truly love it. It last long so I only use it once a week on my scalp and also on the edges and ends of my hair. I put a little in my conditioner as well; I aslo notice that my scalp itches less. I even use it on my boys hair. Overall great product and I will be reordering a larger size next time!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"I've been using Nature's Way Metabolic Reset for 4 weeks and am very impressed. I am very overweight and have been looking for a meal replacement that fills me up while providing protein and fiber. This fits the bill. I know there are other vitamins in it, but I take multivitamins anyway, so I'm not as concerned about that. Anyways, I'm a foodie, so I love to eat. Reset satisfies my hunger and I do not feel deprived. I've lost 15 pounds so far, but haven't started my exercise program yet. I anticipate continued success with this product.I've tried all three flavors and like chocolate the best. Strawberry is a distant second and the vanilla falls to last place. None of them are horrible, though.I highly recommend."
grocery gourmet food,baby food,cereal,5.0,"My 3 1/2 month old was eating all the time and reconstituted rice cereal with breast milk just wasn't doing the trick. After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try. I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food. My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner). Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far. It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,2.0,"When I read the positve reviews on this product, I ordered it. It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium, this soup would fit the bill. If you are just trying to cut back on salt, again this soup will work fine. I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try. I like the convenience of it being ready to serve but I must admit, it has very little flavor. It's almost like drinking water with a slight mushroom taste. Truthfully, I miss the salt. I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland. When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference. Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin. I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial. I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes. I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products. However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful. I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious. More companies should do the same. Salt and sugar must and should be reduced -- a little can go a long way."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"This coffee has very good flavor and reminds me of my time living in Jordan. It sure brought back many memories. That said, I have finally found a local supplier that is much more reasonably priced. But if you can't find Turkish coffee in your area, this is a very good product."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love this tea. It has an AMAZING creamy strawberry scent and I just can't get enough of it!Unfortunately like with most teas, the scent is better than taste. I like mixing it with lemon juice and honey - it gets to be simply divine!I like using my big mug and have to put 2 tea bags to get the right flavor. I have a feeling I'll go through it pretty quick. I drink it every day and would recommend this tea to everyone."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"Lots of pills to swallow but really good. I've moved on to other things because of that, but this is a 5 star product nonetheless."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,5.0,"Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.The Product?These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I bought the product based on a recommendation at a big vitamin store (Willner) in NY whose salespersonseemed to be very knowledgeable. I was looking forward to find a natural substitute to theStatins that I have been taking for years (40mg) and which kept my cholesterol level low.Let me note that I am watching my cholesterol diet as well as weight and I exercise almost every day.After one month of using Cholestsure instead of the Statin, my LDL went up from 81 to 191!!!!Nothing changed in my diet, stress level etc... only substituting one pill (statis) to 3 pillsa day of Cholestsure. A side note"
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,5.0,"Ordered for myself, absolutely love it. You wouldn't believe how much tar accumulated inside the filter after one cigarette. Ordering more for my parents. Would recommend to all smokers!"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,1.0,"Ok, I'm all for natural treatments. But, this is product does not work. In fact, I am more stuffed now from using it only for 2 days. I will now have to go to the doctor to get medicine whereas before I was just having light stuffiness mainly in the morning. I can barely breathe out of my nose now. I'll be returning this!"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I had been having Hodgson Mill's oat bran (which is also a great cereal) when I noticed this also on the shelf at the grocery store. I know that flax is good for you so I thought I'd give it a try. I like it even better than the plain oat bran because of the nuttier flavor and texture. I will say that I don't fully cook it according to package directions -- 2 minutes in the microwave, let sit for a few minutes, and that is it. I add one square of dark chocolate after cooking, and let it melt. Then I stir gently and top with a bit of skim milk. Keeps me satisfied easily until lunch with no spikes or drops in energy levels. Happy to see it available on amazon."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I have a wheat allergy and have tried just about every type of gluten and wheat free cookie mix out there. I have to say that this cookie mix is a-m-a-z-i-n-g and the BEST.Prep and Baking:Super easy, you add butter and an egg, that's it. You want to bake them until the bottom of the cookie is a light brown, be sure not to over bake. I knew they would taste good, as even the dry mix was super yummy, not overly sweet, but more buttery and chocolaty tasting.Texture:The texture of these cookies is so light and fluffy; they simply melt in your mouth. They also have the perfect combination of an ever so slight chewiness and a hint of crunch. Basically they look and feel just like a ""real"" chocolate chip cookie.Taste"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I use Bio Freeze spray for my feet at night and it works well to stop the burning on the ball of my feet.
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,5.0,"I have been using this for about 2 to 3 weeks now.. i can tell u it is amazing at how much tar is contained in this gadget. i have even used filtered cigars with this and seems more tar is obtained than a cigarette. i only use it during break at work or when i'm out drinking with friends.. i am technically a social smoker, but i would recommend this to anyone who smokes more or less than me.. The only problem is of course the smell of it when it is full of tar.. i would highly recommend using isoprophyl alcohol. Not the rubbing kind, the kind you might find at a chemical store. Just leave it in a cup to soak overnight and if you did purchase the brushes, they would help but u can pretty much use anything really. i would also recommend rubber gloves so nothing gets on your hands.. for me to get rid of the smell, i used fabreeze spray.. i really don't know when to replace the o-rings.. but i would change it when its up to the smoker.. other than the cleaning, i enjoy using the targard filter. thank you for your time.. and if you do purchase this, do enjoy using it.."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I was looking for a natural product for coughs and all my research led me to Enzymatic Therapy. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough. Soothes the bronchial passage and soothes coughs! I highly recommend you try this product. It works great with our 5 year old if he starts to get a cough.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This has helped me lose some weight, but it did have an anticoagulant effect that I was not expecting. About two months after I started taking this, I had a cut that would not stop bleeding for quite a while. I am pleased with the weight loss, and my guess is I won't be throwing a clot any time soon."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,4.0,"This soup base does indeed make a lovely coconut ginger soup, and is much faster and easier than trying to make it from scratch. I was intrigued by the instructions for making this into a rice dish, but thought the results were underwhelming. While the soup has a wonderful flavor, the rice dish was rather bland and disappointing. Still, I bought this to make soup, and do love the soup it makes so 4 stars."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,this is a great product if you are prone to xold sores and oral irritations I would reccomend this product to all
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,1.0,This coffee was absolutely awful. Weak coffee with a chemical taste. I can't return it; I am now stuck with several packages of this awful swill. :(
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"This is the best hot chili sauce in the Asian section, IMO.I dearly love heat, but this is more than that - it tastes good too. No aftertaste, undertaste, or sidetaste, just 'good taste' - and it is hot, did I mention that? I use it on all kinds of foods, and it's a staple in my fridge. It doesn't really change the food taste much, which I like.One of my favorites is hot & sour soup, and add a heaping tablespoon of this stuff. Not recommended for the faint of tongue.If you have only a few kinds of hot sauce, this should be one of them."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,I was so happy to see these for such a great price! I am a working mom and pump 4x a day. I couldn't live without my pump. My only complaint is that the cup portion of the shield is frosted which makes it a little more difficult to see if everything is centered for an ideal fit.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,2.0,"Just to let everyone know, this product is NOT gluten free. It contains barley, which is not a GF grain. My favorite Dr. McDougall's soup is the Black Bean! So good!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"my breast fed baby loves these as well. for travel, you need to use the disc to prevent leaks. great bottle"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"This is a great product to help with insomnia. Really great. Some do not like the smell or taste, but I actually love it. Maybe it is an acquired test. A+++ for this product, it is excellent."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Misleading, because it's not pure flax. Once I received it I was disappointed but I thought ""hey, maybe it'll taste delicious with the sunflower oil, rosemary extract and all that..."" but no, it's bitter and not enjoyable at all."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I love using the Biotone Massage Gel! It glides like oil, but washes out like water! The money I save on sheets and work clothes makes it worth paying a little extra for this product. I have been using it for the last 15 years."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,5.0,"I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups. They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.The Maple oatmeal is very good. My one recommendation is to fill the cup slightly higher than the fill line; otherwise the oatmeal may come out too thick."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We bought this chair to use when we visited all of the grandparents over the holidays. It strapped tightly to a wide variety of chairs and my 8-month-old little one loved it. The height adjustment is great - worked for a variety of table and chair heights. It snaps down into a fairly small size, which is great for the car. There are 2 things I disliked about it, but they are minor. The first is that the tray is a little difficult to unsnap. My husband had no problem, but it takes me a few seconds to get it loose. The second problem is my little one figured out how to pull the tray insert up towards her. It doesn't go very far up due to the way it snaps in, but she did enjoy banging it around. Overall, it works really well and is quite handy. It would probably work well if you wanted to use it as a primary high chair, but it's great for travel."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Prelief has changed my life. I can't put words to how amazing this stuff is. I suffer from Interstitial Cystitis, and prior to finding Prelief, I was in *AGONY*. No sleep, curled up in a ball in the worst pain of my life. Someone suggested Prelief, which I had never heard of, and by the next day, I felt human again. It's been two weeks since I started taking this with every meal, snack and drink, and I can now say that I often forget I even have IC. I can eat foods I otherwise I couldn't, I can drink coffee with it, I can live a normal and pain free life. THANK YOU to the makers of Prelief for giving me my life back."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,3.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I used to have an Eglauf Clamp (bought on Amazon) that applied pressure to both sides of the hand simultaneously and it worked better for me than this band. However, the clamp broke and is no longer available anywhere...I don't think it's even made anymore. This band is the next best thing. This item is a good addition to my migraine arsenal. I use it along with OTC medication, ice packs for forehead and neck, and laying down and relaxing. It doesn't cure anything by itself, but it eases the intensity of the pain and assists with the relief. The band is adjustable with a hook and loop on elastic, so it probably fits most adult hands. It started to fray almost immediately upon wearing, however the fraying didn't continue and it seems to be holding together fine. A side note"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love a hearty cup of black tea, but have been trying to cut down on my caffeine. Herbal teas just aren't my thing. My previous experience with decaf black tea has been that they end up weak and wimpy in flavor. I assumed it was a side effect of the decaffeination process. Apparently it doesn't have to be, because PG Tips has created a wonderful, strong, smooth cuppa in decaf here."
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,5.0,"I have been trying to find the right sippy cup for 6 months and just stumbled upon one of these on clearance at walmart. I thought I would give it a shot and lo and behold, it is phenomenal! My little man loves it and it is the only sippy cup he has ever used! I have a cabinet full of every different shape, size, and kind of sippies that just sit there because he refuses them! I've searched everywhere in stores and couldn't find anymore so I am thrilled to find them on amazon! These cups are great because they are relatively easy to clean, they don't leak or spill, and I absolutely love that they are insulated. The only downsides are that I'm not crazy about some of the designs or prints and they do have a tendency to splash some liquid on you when you flip them open but overall I am very pleased with this product and intend to purchase several."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"What else can I really say, I was looking for a hawthorne berry extract for a good price, and this really is the best that I found after doing some research."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,1.0,I got this because I heard wonderful reviews about it but the milk I got was clearly used. Not pleased.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"This is a great product and often not always available in stores. Good to be able to purchase in bulk. I purchased this same carton of 12 Sweet and Low bulk boxes in March of 2011 and the price was $23.72. Now the price is over $64 for the same item, plus over $10 shipping!! Bottom line--as with any retail transaction, you need to determine whether or not the price is reasonable in relation to other sources of the same product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have two daughters who are self-professed vegetarians- and anemia runs in our family. So I was not surprised when the pediatrician said they needed to take a daily iron supplement. We tried the liquid iron drops (which was a daily battle) and children's chewable multivitamins (which were almost as hard to get them to take as the liquid iron was) before we found this product. WOW! What a difference this product has made in our lives! Instead of trying to coerce them into taking their iron supplement they now ASK for it- every day! They say this tastes like candy so we have to keep it out of sight and we've had the talk about too many vitamins could make you sick, but now we have no more fights about vitamin taking! YEAH!!! Parents of anemic children talk to your pediatrician about this product!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I have been using this product for several years and it helps me be able to deal with my severe cases that would have put me in the nut house for 6 months, (Just Joking) but this is a miracle product for me and has made poison ivy contact easy to deal with."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I started taking MET-Rx in the early 90's after taking junk like Hot Stuff etc. I could not believe what happened to me. In just two weeks I saw results. I started gaining strength and size almost immediately. Started at 165 and ended up at 205+. My personal records done while taking two MET-Rx a day were 365 bench, 395 squat and 335 x 3 *stiff leg* dead lift. I still use MET-Rx to this day although I admit I only take one a day now. I also took creatine which made me strong and HMB."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,Tortuga Rum Cakes are a great choice. ALways fresh and moist. never have had a bad product come from them. I would recommend them to anyone.
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"When I received my Adventure Medical .9 I opened it up and checked the contents, everything was there that was expected. However the moleskin was not precut, a plus in my book, but others may disagree. The outer waterproof bag contains two inner waterproof bags, perfect if you want a striped down kit for a day-hike. Fully packed there is still a bit of extra room to supplement your own equipment, but if you plan on adding a lot, be prepared to remove some items. As far as expiration dates, the earliest was April 2013 but was ibuprofen so easily replaced, and the average was in 2014. Very satisfied."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,cereals,4.0,I was shocked at the size of the box. 2 Huge bags.Fresh and it will last a long time .
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am a 63 year old female. I have bad arthritis in both knees. After one month of taking this product, I can tell a difference in the AMOUNT of pain so much that I will continue to buy this product. I take 3 TWICE a day. I also take Ultra Omega-3 and take 2 twice a day. NOW is a great product and the price is affordable."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,Great price & prompt delivery service!!! Will definitely order again in the future. Love the automatic ship feature! Prices were even lower than my last order!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"The product is what I expected. It arrived on time and in good shape. I had been buying this size for some time. I have only recently stumbled upon this same product, from the same manufacturer in a 250 capsule size.......which is what I'll be buying from now on. This is a good price (100 capsules), that is a better one (250 capsules). Either way, I'm pleased with the product!"
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"I have been so sick in my first eight weeks and have food aversions to everything. It got to where I could not swallow my prenatal vitamin. It was big and even cutting it in half did not help. Something about it dragging over my throat triggered my gag reflex and I just couldn't do it anymore. I was at a loss of what to do, knowing that I have to take a prenatal. I did a search for liquid prenatals and came across this product. Bolstered by all the good reviews, I ordered a bottle. It came today. I shook it up and put a teaspoonful in some apple juice. Wow! It was painless! It tastes good, I would say even improved the flavor of my juice. You do have to refrigerate after opening and it says to shake well before every use. My husband has been harassing me to take a prenatal also. So from myself, the fetus and my hubby---THANKS! I should attach a photo of me cheering!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"The smell of this cologne is one very different from regular perfume. It is not alcoholy or overwhelming but pleasant and sweet and fruity. When I put it on I instantly begin giggling or laughing because it has an uplifting effect on me. It actually smells like a person so to say and it blends with your smell. About the pheromone and attraction thing im not 100% sure on this because I have only used it at university but I did notice some reactions around me and people looking at me weird, but I can't tell for sure that this is just the perfume as I dress up with dresses and skirts and with makeup, still I believe something does happens. You rub it in your warmer places and pressure points for better results. Smell goes away after like 2 hours and last for a long time ( that is if you don't wear it everyday) If you want to smell amazing and personal then this is for you, but if you just want to attract mates try a stronger scent. Overall im loving the experience, but it depends on the culture you are living too, united states is very antisocial they dont look at you in the face and just don't care, you gotta go where people are friendly"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,1.0,"These are my husbands favorite SF cookies, and our grocery seems to always be out... they have the vanilla & peanut butter ones.... but always seem out of the chocolate. I was going to buy some here, until I saw the price. You've got to be kidding! They are good, but come on....... on one search I find $13+ for 1 pack... on another I find $8+... from the same vendor. What give? These should be no more than $3-4."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,1.0,"For me it was a short bout of itchy eyes and an extremely runny nose( I have also taken them on more than one occasion, with the same results every time) when I first started to take them I would just blame the weather, but after taking too many in too many different occasions I figured it was probably just a slight allergic reaction.It could have worked if whatever was in it that gave me the sniffles and itchy eyes so bad was not in it.If you have never tried it before I would suggest starting with a small package first.I am not sure how bad this reaction could get, or if other people are more sensitive.I would actually advise anyone to speak to there healthcare provider about this one, especially if you haveever had an allergic reaction to antibiotics, pollen, or pet dander."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"My wife loves this product, she wont go without itAnd I dont want her to. It replaces the estrogen she was taken from the doctorMort"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Hands down the best chocolate flavor among protein shakes - but they come at a cost, calories - so be sure to take that into consideration. FYI, I mix it with peanut butter/water on a blender, sometimes I add a shot of espresso...simply delicious!"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,3.0,"I've yet to use this product yet. It arrived in a 100g white bottle, sort of like a medicine bottle rather than a pack of 2 50g. The bottle seems a little worn, maybe from travel. It also isn't pure asafoetida---I should have read the other reviews. Also the bottle is about 1/4th empty. Hopefully it will work for my recipes though."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This omega taste better than the others I have tryied, almost no fish smell, easy to swallow. Safe to use for kids and pregnant woman. I'm using both as a suplement to my pre natal vitamins and to improve my boy attention. I'm very pleased."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I was a little nervous to try my first ""Ultimate Meal"" shake this morning for breakfast because of the bad reviews about the taste. I was pleasantly surprised since I was expecting something really awful. I think the key is to find the right mixture for your palate. I didn't use the apple but used frozen banana, replaced the water with unsweetened almond milk (only 35 calories per cup), and added 2 tbsps of PB2 (the chocolate one). Besides the fact that it was green, it tasted pretty good...like a chocolate banana peanut butter smoothie. I drank it at 8:30 this morning within the 15 minutes it suggests and I'm still quite full 3 hours later and I feel energized. I have been doing the Insanity workout program and I was looking for something to fuel my body afterwards. I couldn't see myself drinking this shake BEFORE a workout because I exercise so early in the morning and I don't think I would keep it down considering all the high-intensity cardio. This does appear to be a good post-workout meal however. I'm guessing it will take care of my breakfast and morning snack then I will eat lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner to get my 5 meals/day. All in all, I want to improve my overall health and lose weight. I know this meal replacement doesn't claim to help you lose weight, but I'm hoping it will help me cut calories during the day. If you're on the fence about this product solely because you're afraid it will taste bad, you need to try my recipe above because it was pretty good and totally drinkable!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"On the package, it clearly states that these are for use in all pod brewers. So, naturally, I thought I'd be able to use them in my Keurig single cup brewer. I guess if I get a My K-cup I might be able to use these, but otherwise, I wasted my money. I'm very disappointed. Live and learn, I suppose."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,2.0,"This product totally eliminates heartburn & reflux. I had serious problems with reflux (including nighttime choking from acid in throat) and this was the fix; taking this, it was like the acid never happened.In the past I was a subscriber and would have given this product 5 stars. (Amazon's subscription service was excellent.)However, this product also has the capability to send you to the hospital if you're not careful. Be aware of side effects, especially loss of calcium and potentially other minerals. Prilosec is noted for weakened bones leading to breaks, but that's not the only outcome. I ended up with extreme weakness and heart symptoms, ambulance, a hospital stay, thousands of dollars of medical expenses and a long and difficult period of recovery from a mineral deficiency. This was the most difficult episode I've ever dealt with in my life, and after extensive medical testing eliminated some other possibilities, Prilosec stands out as the likely culprit. I certainly wish I had known beforehand.I might have saved myself major problems if I had realized the risks, so I would like to warn others"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,2.0,"I much prefer the Original Cholula hot sauce. This variant adds a heavy dose of garlic to what was otherwise a fine hot sauce. Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some garlic - then add it yourself and in the quantity you prefer.This sauce really should be called a Garlic Sauce. The garlic flavoring is so over powering that it is hard to detect any heat from the chilies.The original Cholula hot sauce is a fine hot sauce, much better than average. Unfortunately some marketing ""genius"" came up with both a lime and a garlic version of the original sauce. In either case, these variants are worse than the original and so heavy handed with their flavorings that they obscure the finer qualities of the basic sauce.I love both garlic and lime. But I prefer to add these ingredients - when and if needed - in the exact quantities I prefer.Buy the original Cholula hot sauce!BTW"

health personal care,health care,stress reduction,4.0,"I have a cat who chronically overgrooms. Something will set her off and she increases this problematic behavior. I have been using Rescue Remedy for about one month and it has reduced, but not eliminated the problem. I am seeing regrowth of hair, but there are still patchy spots. She is quite fussy when I try to administer anything, so I put a few drops on Temptation treats twice a day and she eats them up. I've tried the collar and other lotions, so short of RX medication, Rescue Remedy has produced the most positive results."

You may as well be eating a cookie and popping a multivitaminevery bar has 23g (92 Calories) of sugar compared to 10g of protein! D-:i know it is an ""energy"" bar, but why is the energy coming from sugar??the only reason i see for buying this is if you want to replace junk food, like chips and cookies. This is definately a better choice. But a terrible choice if you are looking to get in shape."
health personal care,health care,unknown,1.0,"I am a light sleeper who has been using ear plugs at night for several years. About 8 years ago I began usingMack's Pillow Soft Silicone Earplugswith great results. However, I decided to try something new with Ohropax after reading the many positive reviews.I followed the instructions to the letter, and I immediately noticed that the earplugs were greasy and left my fingers uncomfortably sticky. The wax plugs were at first hard when I removed them from the cotton and difficult to mold. However, they did soften with a little work. Trying to get the small chunks of cotton off of them was also a pain. Afterward I found myself having to wash my hands to remove the sticky film left behind.The plugs stayed in at first, but one of them fell out during the night. Putting it back in was another sticky adventure. Throughout the night, I had to press the plugs back in several times to keep them in place. I noticed that when they had been over my ear canal for sometime the plugs had become gooey soft, which added to the problem.The next night I went back to the Mack's silicone plugs. I find them much more comfortable and dependable, as I easily get 8 to 10 uses out of a pair. Plus, it's very easy to split the Mack's in half to get double the usage without losing their effectiveness.I really wanted to like the Ohropax ear plugs, but for now I'll consider this loss as stupid tax."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I recently bought these Wilton tints and they worked great! I was able to tint white cake batter as well as buttercream frosting in seconds. I do have to say, however, that the colors come out much better when used in the icing than in the batter. However, overall, I was very pleased with how good the product was. I agree with other reviewers about the red tint. The red never seems to get really ""red"", but rather a really bright pink-red shade. I used at least 8 of the colors in the past week, and have been really happy with all of them! Highly recommend! It is a great price for the variety that you get. You only have to use a small amount of tint, so the set should last you a very long time. This is a must have for any aspiring baker...and they work WAY better than food coloring! Have fun!!"
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"The basic idea is interesting, to have a glove that has spots that are firmer than the hand to give a harder or more focused pressure. But the spot must be on an easy to use place for the finger or palm of hand to direct the pressure. If the glove doesn't fit snugly, the plastic buttons shift around and are hard to use.Gel points would be better, and instead of small spots on the heel of the hand, have a band about 3/4 inch wide running along the knife edge of the hand and the heel of the palm. The spots on the upper palm didn't do much at all, it would be better to put a band of something over the knuckles to get more precise control and deeper pressure.interesting idea but don't waste your money."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,2.0,"I have been drinking cinnamon, vanilla, pecan flavored coffee for some time now. My favorite is Lola Savannah, it is delicious but rather expensive considering you must pay shipping. I finally found a fairly close second, Target's Archer Farm brand. It is really good, too, but you can't buy it on-line and the nearest store is 30 miles away so when I run out I can't just go get it when I need it. I was in high hopes this coffee would at least come close. Boy, was I disappointed. When I opened the bag and smelled it I was rather certain it wasn't going to be good. Just as I expected, it did not taste any better than it smelled. It tastes old and stale and I cannot taste any of the flavores it says it has in it. Now I am stuck with 4 bags of coffee I can hardly drink."

I would say that the itchy and the redness goes away when you start working out.Didn't fell any side effects.I was taking 4 pills before working out (about 20mins before).I was a little bit exceptical with this product, especially because I had never heard before of the Lab and the green man on the bottle is a little bit weird.Give it a try...

However, it does have a smell to it, my young son calls it the ""macaroni smelling thing"". I think it is probably stuffed with something like corn meal and that is what is causing the smell. I would have given it 5 stars if it was odorless."

The information only said that the protein content was 20g perserving, but not that that would include 24g of carbs. There are much better shakes out there that will help build muscle. (i.e. muscle milk or muscle milk light) This would be considered more of a mass gainer than protein shake because with 24g of carbs you will gain unwanted weight from drinking this shake."

My husband got sick several times & I kept telling him to drnk the tea! The last time he finally listened & ended up not even missing any days at work. He keeps a box for himself at work now. You don't have to be sick tho, it's a great tasting tea...even if you don't like green tea. And the bonus is that it's good for you!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,2.0,"Luna promised me a protein bar with peanut buttery goodness but I was lied to!!! This in no way tastes like a peanut butter cookie, let alone peanut butter anything. The first ingredients should be peanut something or other but its towards the bottom. I knew that this was not going to be like a peanut butter cookie but I thought at least it would have a peanut butter taste. I guess the best way for me to describe the taste would be like a very sweet yogurt like coating on the bottom of a supper sweet saccahrin sweet rice crispy thing. The one that I really enjoyed was the Nuts Over Chocolate luna bar, that one has a nice peanut taste and delicious chocolate bottom to boot. So dont go in thinking that you are going to get any peanut butter taste at all, but if you like a mystery flavor thats really sweet then go for it. I give it two stars because at least it has nutrition in it."

Economical - almost daily use in two diffusers and 4 months later, Ive gone through a little more than half the bottle. All natural and no smoke unlike incense or resins, so it wont negatively impact health via smoke inhalation. Just a great scent."

When you buy the bottle version you are required to toss is after it has been open for 3 mos. I always end up throwing out 90 strips from a 100 strip bottle, if you do he math you end up spending more on the bottles than the foil wrapped. Unless you test often this is the way to go."

It always felt so good, so I finally asked to see what they used. Turned out to be the Wahl All Body Massage! I couldn't have been happier to find out it was so affordable. Now my wife and I give each other back massages after long days of work (seriously nothing sexual). Not sure how long it will last, but with how cheap it is, its easy to replace."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is priced a few dollars less than at store, and the 24-oz packaging makes it easy to keep your flour from going stale too quickly. The automatic reordering option is great, too, so you can get an additional discount and plan on your next shipment.If you are making recipes using Annalize Roberts', ""Gluten Free Baking,"" she mentions this brand is too coarse for most of the cake recipes (but OK for pizza dough.) I bought some white rice flour from the Asian store and you can definitely feel the difference. The finer ground flour felt like regular flour, and Bob's Red Mill had a slight grittiness to it."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"When I first got home from the hospital and my milk hadn't quite come in yet, this pump was invaluable to me. My big double electric pump didn't get anything from me, but this little guy got just enough - an ounce or two from each breast in less than 10 minutes. My son had lots of difficulty latching, so we decided we were going to exclusively pump and bottle feed the breast milk. I wouldn't recommend this product for everyday use - a big double electric pump gets about 10-12 ounces from me in less than 15 minutes. However, I keep this little one in a gallon zip lock bag in my car in the event of an emergency. If I didn't bring enough milk with me, I could always get this one out and fix a quick bottle without having to bring my big pump with me everywhere. Different pumps are made for different reasons - this is a very good investment to have on hand for certain situations. I highly recommend!"

I've taken these for years, always get them from Amazon, and they always arrive in perfect condition. The bottom line is that I just feel better every day I take these, and I never get sick even when my wife does. I'm a prime member and I order a ton of stuff from Amazon, but this is the first time I've ever felt the need to actually write a review. I love this stuff. There might be debates about the best whatever other supplements, but when it comes to vitamins these are hands down the best."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Echinacea works for me. It's not some kind of silver bullet, but it definitely helps me when I'm catching a cold or recovering from one. I used this product at the optimal time as instructed, and I believe it helped. In one instance I did come down with a cold, the typical kind that doesn't stop you from going to work but makes you miserable all day. However, I don't expect echinacea to prevent colds in the same way that vaccinations prevent certain illnesses.Some people swear that echinacea doesn't help them. I believe it helps me and I think it's a kind of wonder herb. This product seems to have a good dosage of quality echinacea so I recommend it for those that benefit from this herb."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying, if you are looking for crazy hot, this isn't the hot sauce for you. I would call it luke warm hot, but the flavor of this sauce is very good which is why I give it 5 stars. If you are looking for crazy hot, try Dave's Gourmet Insanity Sauce (which I have also tried and reviewed) or Daves Gourmet Ghost Pepper (which I haven't tried, but if it is hotter than Insanity, it must be ridunkulous hot). I like my hot sauce to have some flavor which is why I like this Habanero Sauce...the flavor is very good...just not very hot. I can actually just put this sauce straight to the tongue without much of a problem. Bottom line...if you are looking for a good flavored hot sauce that won't make your tongue shrivel, this is a good one to try out."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"Usually when a supplement company discontinues a product and creates a new one to take its place, you can be pretty sure that the new one is just going to be a watered down version of the old one. However, this is definitely not the case with Hydroxycut Hardcore Pro. For those of you who don't know, Muscletech recently discontinued a great product called Hydroxycut Hardcore X. In place of it, they came out with their ""Pro Series"". Being a big fan of the ""X Series"", I had some misgivings when I first purchased the Pro but I will say that i am impressed with this formula. They worked all the kinks out of it as well as increased the potency. I have never before had so much energy as I do with this new formula and without all the sleeplessness and ""jitters"" that are apparently so common with most other diet pills. According to the recommendations of several reviewers, I have been supplementing this with another supplement called 'Carb Stopper Extreme' that is supposed to boost the results of the Hydroxycut formula. My results with the two have been outstanding! I have been able to cut 15.3 pounds in just under two weeks and I feel fantastic. This combination has really given me the boost I needed."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,rice cakes,3.0,"It is an OK rice cracker, but the cheese flavor is very light. It is nice and crispy like the other Ka-Me crackers.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"When I have trouble winding down, I make myself this tea. It has stevia in it, so once I weaned myself off of needing REALLY SWEET tea, I realized that I don't need to add anything to it. The longer it steeps, the better it tastes. This is what started my love affair with Yogi teas. It's usually about $4.50 a box in the grocery stores (DC area, so your mileage may vary), so the subscribe and save option on here, or even just getting one six pack, is a HUGE savings. Highly recommended."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have a 2 week old baby that LOVES to nurse. He loves to suck I think partly for the comfort of it at times. I have had an amazing milk flow production so far... however, a few days ago, I felt like I was running low, and I found myself drinking a chamomile vanilla tea about 3 times a day. I LOVE herbal teas... so I thought, why not drink tea that will actually help with producing more milk. I have been eyeing this on amazon lately. I read a lot of reviews about taste, etc. So I wanted to try it first. I send my husband to our local organic health food store. MIND you, he paid about $8 for ONE box of 16 bags of tea. I immediately tried some, and I take my tea with honey... and I REALLY liked it. I was thinking to myself, why others do not like the taste?! Another thing worth mentioning, I use my Keurig coffee maker to brew the HOT water, in my 16oz Contigo cup. I dont like the idea of a hot cup of tea around my baby without a lid and am paranoid it would burn someone. I carry my Contigo cup everywhere with me, full of tea. That said, I only use 1 tea bag in my 16onz cup. This is double the size they say to use on the box. However, I dont think it is bad... You should drink significantly MORE water when you're nursing. I actually always have my 30onz cup of ice water. I do drink this tea before bed, typically 1 to 2 16onz cups. I drink the same sized cup in the morning when I wake up, and throughout the day I drink it either over ice, or in the hot cup... As I said, I like the taste, and being that I am not going on 3 days drinking this, I can see the difference. If the difference is because of this tea, or just the fact that my son nurses A LOT and my body is making more milk to compensate for that fact, I dont care. I like the tea and will continue to drink it. THIS price here is the BEST I have found around. I subscribed and saved too.I suggest watering down the tea a little if you think it tastes too strong and put some honey in it. Honey is better than sugar and tastes delicious inside..."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I have been using this product for about 7 months. I enjoy the Rainfall setting and the Summer Night setting.I was not sure whether to get this product, since several people said that it did not work, or stopped working soon after they got it, and complained about the quality of the sounds.However, mine has been working fine. Here is my situation and how I use it:I don't have insomnia or anything that keeps me alert and awake. I tend to sleep lightly and wake up when small sounds happen during the night, so I bought this item to help me go back to sleep when I wake. It does the job perfectly. I think the quality and variety of the sounds are just fine; I like them and they sound real to me.I keep it about 2 feet from my head and do not crank it up, so I haven't been able to notice the sound loops as some people have. I think I would notice them if I had it right next to me, but keeping it further back seems to solve that problem. Pretty much the only button I push on the thing is the timer button. I don't twist the volume knob; I just set the timer and let it run or go off according to the minutes. So I haven't had any staticky issues with the volume knob.Bottom line, I don't move it, I don't mess with it, and it works fine. That may not be the most helpful, but if you're like me and you plan to put it on your night stand and just leave it there, then I think it's a pretty safe bet.Update to review"

The serum is great for my skin, but leaves it just a bit tight after it fully absorbs. I apply a bit of the rose water after the serum, and it refreshes, locks in some moisture, and prevents that tight feeling from occurring. Also, smells divine."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"It's easy to get confused by what fish oil to buy. You're basically looking for two things - quantity of active ingredient and purity. EPA and DHA are the active, helpful component of fish oil and these are the numbers you want to pay attention to. Far too many fish oil supplements only list the amount of oil in the capsule (usually 1000mg or 1200mg) in large print on the front label. This can be deceiving because the active ingredient is generally only 300mg (180mg EPA, 120mg DHA). This 180/120 formulation is indicative of fishoil that whose quality and potency can best be described as ""baseline"". The cheap 180/120 store brand fish oils are also of suspect purity as well. They are probably ""ok"", but most of them are rebranded bargain basement formulations so you're not quite sure what you're getting without doing research.So where does that leave us with this product? Well, NOW Super EPA is a 320/240 potency formulation which means it has twice the active ingredient as most baseline formulas. These capsules are no bigger than standard 1000mg capsules, so it's not like you're swallowing a horse pill either. NOW has a very solid reputation in the supplement industry for potent, high quality supplements. You can trust the purity claims on this product.So here is some math to show you what you're getting for your money. 360mg EPA + 240mg DHA = 600mg active ingredient per softgel. 240 softgels = 144grams active ingredient per bottle. At approximately $23/bottle at the time of this review, that is 16 cent per gram of active ingredient.After doing a fair amount of research, this was the lowest price I could find from a reputable manufacturer. Buy with confidence knowing you got a great deal here."

Only downsize is that you have to take 3 per day, but it is totally worth it because it absorbs better to take one with each meal anyway. Also, drink your milk because these don't have a full daily value of Calcium. Reason being that it is the calcium that makes most vitamins huge to begin with. It is a very large mineral. Could be coated better for easier swallowing but they are so small to begin with that this isn't much of a complaint.Ps... Even if you were to only take one per day it is still better than not taking a vitamin at all!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I was really looking for something that DIDN'T taste like a protein drink. Maybe my standards are too high but this wasn't what I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, it tastes okay but it definitely has a protein drink taste.It is also worth mentioning that I did have several of these that were damaged in shipping. In the product's and Amazon's defense, I don't think it was designed to be shipped via methods such as UPS or FedEx. However, Amazon's customer support is always outstanding and they promptly issued me a GENEROUS credit (talk about great customer service.)I'd suggest that anyone who does purchase these understand that there is a high risk of damage during shipping. Also, just because the lid is still tight doesn't mean that these are okay to drink. Squeeze the container and make sure there is no give. That confirms you still have an airtight seal. This product is very susceptible to mold and other air-born pathogens so even a slight dose of air can make the product dangerous to drink."

health personal care,health care,unknown,1.0,"This is one hundred twenty-three dollars worth of placebo. Anyone considering using this or any other homeopathic remedy really needs to become aware of the fanciful principles behind homeopathy - it's not some sort of natural, herb-based treatment; it's pure wish-thinking. Homeopaths believe that a substance which produces disease symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure a person already suffering from the same symptoms. If that's not childish enough, homeopaths also believe that in order for this magic to work, the ""active ingredient"" must be diluted repeatedly until not a single molecule of the substance remains in the dilution medium (water.)Read that again - there are NO ingredients in homeopathic remedies apart from water, sometimes sugar, and whatever binding agent is used to turn this ""concentrated nothing"" into pill form. This is why homeopathic doctors (read:QUACKS) can state truthfully that there are no side effects to homeopathic medicines - there are no effects whatsoever, beyond a possible placebo effect. For years skeptics like James Randi have downed whole bottles of homeopathic sleeping pills while delivering lectures on the idiocy of homeopathy, with nary an ill effect, and without getting at all drowsy. Unfortunately, due to the general ignorance about this baloney, drug companies have even put homeopathic labels on actual medicines (Zicam, for one) just as a marketing gimmick, even though (by homeopathic standards) the medicines contain a huge overdose. Quackwatch.com has a good section devoted to this nonsense - I recommend anyone considering throwing their money away on these products (AND, by rejecting real medicine, jeopardizing their health) check the site."

health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,"I have had this exact unit and the model before it (Kaz) and loved them both. They are simple to use and are a workhorse. I saw some of the negative reviews and believe the majority of the problems are not the units but the water being used or that they have not been cleaned properly. I am very guilty of not cleaning my unit and as a matter of fact hadn't cleaned this one for the 3 years I used it. I noticed this week that the steam wasn't coming out so I set out to buy another one when it dawned on me it may need cleaning. I did exactly what the owner's manual said to do and my unit is working just like it did when I first got it. We have hard water in our area so don't need to add salt, but if you have soft water you will need to add the salt. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a nice, quiet small unit.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Being an Elementary school teacher, I come into contact with a LOT of germs, and for quite a few years there, I could count reliably on coming down with some sort of new cold or flu every six to eight weeks.While things are no longer *quite* that bad (knock on wood!), I still frequently fall ill during the school year (and am always perfectly healthy during the summer when I'm away from my students!). I felt something coming on just a few weeks ago, and, remembering that I had these capsules, I decided to put them to the test. It was a good time to do it, too, since there was a particularly nasty bug making the rounds at my school. Thankfully, I never did catch whatever it was - either way, it never developed into a full-blown illness - and I fully credit these Gaia Herbs capsules for that.I like that one can look at the packaging, and be able to tell specifically where the contained herbs originated. I also found my nerves soothed by the knowledge that these herbs were processed in a manner that maintains their purity, keeping them pretty much as close to fresh-harvested as possible.It may have only been one time that I tried these out (as you're supposed to consume all 20 capsules, over the course of two days, at the onset of whatever illness you're battling), but they seemed effective enough that I definitely believe they'd be worth it to keep a bottle on hand. I always used to believe firmly in OTC meds for fighting various things off, and was skeptical of vitamin or herbal remedies, but with Dr. Mehmet Oz's consistent touting of natural and herbal remedies, and my own observation of their effectiveness, I think herbal is definitely the healthier, safer way to go on average, and these are being added to my list of smart things to keep on hand..."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Previously, the only way for me to purchase superfine rice flour was on-line. The only brand I could find with the superfine consistency was from the maker, Authentic Foods... at an extremely hefty price (at a little over $6.00 per pound after shipping). It was a fabulous flour that was definitely superfine though, and wonderful for baking. Then I found this rice flour from Thailand. I purchased it, opened it up and immediately compared the texture to my Authentic Foods superfine brand by rubbing the flour between my fingers, and was amazed. This Thai rice flour was waaay finer than the Authentic Foods brand... and cheaper. I didn't know rice flour could get any finer. The only thing is, I found and purchased my Thai rice flour (this exact same brand) at my grocery store (Food-4-Less) for $1.18 per pound. That is much cheaper than what is being sold here. I'd encourage you to check your local grocery store's Asian foods section first, but if you cannot purchase it locally, than Amazon is still selling this Thai brand flour for less than it's competition's lesser quality rice flour from Authentic Foods. Buy it without hesitation."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"Very strong looking, but the taste is pretty mellow. It's not as caffeinated as regular French roast coffee (because of the chicory mixed in). I like it black or with condensed milk.With that said $11 is hilariously overpriced for this. Go to any Vietnamese grocer (or maybe even Chinese) and you can find it for around $4-$7. If you don't have a Viet/Chinese grocer then by all means buy it here or from Cafe du Monde themselves. Another reviewer pondered why a ""Chinese"" grocer would have it---it's highly possible it's a Viet grocer. And if you know any history of Indochina then you'll know why they carry it. ;) ENJOY!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I purchased a carbon steel skillet and began an experiment with the anti sticking properties of flax seed oil. I got the method on the internet which consists of high heat and multiple applications of flax seed oil on the pan. The method stated required 5 treatments lasting about 2 hours each. Using my gas grill on high, I was able to apply the same nonstick surface on the carbon steel skillet in half the time. Apply oil to warm skillet with paper towel, super thin coat. Turn on grill to high, put skillet on grill upside down cook for 45 minutes, let cool to 200*, reapply oil 5 times. Comes out light colored carbon and non stick as long as you don't wash with soap or use acidic juice such as lemon. In addition, after use and cleaning(hot water-paper towel) I put a few drops of oil in the skillet and wipe out with a paper towel. This was far superior to the other nonstick methods touted. Works equally as well on cast iron. This was the best price I found and the product is not just for your health."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,3.0,"I wanted a moist heating pad that was like the one I used many years ago and lasted for years. Though this may be among the best in the market place, it doesn't fulfill my needs and was returned. The reason is that the instructions state that you can't lay on it and if you do, it won't be able to generate the moisture needed (which is by chemical means). If I was able to lay on my stomach, I feel certain that this unit would be able to provide me with the comfort and relief I need. I since have learned that most, if not all, heating pads warn against laying on them for fear of the user falling asleep. If there isn't a timed automatic cut-off, it could result in severe burns, especially if the heating pad remains on a high setting for an extended period. That seems to be a liability issue that has little to do with laying on most heating pads."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Any bottle nipple, no matter the hole size, is going to be too fast for a breastfed baby - even this one at first. BOTTLE NIPPLES give baby CONSTANT FLOW, whether they're sucking or not. On the breast, however, baby has nearly full control of how much and how fast milk comes out. It's why the Ameda breast pump (Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump) gives you a 'Cycle' option. You start out fast - just as your baby does when they first latch on - to allow for the milk let-down. Then, you switch to a slower cycle motion to get the most milk out - just as your baby would once they started feeding. On a bottle nipple, if baby starts fast, of course they're going to have issues at first, until they slow down their sucking motion.I regret buying the MAM bottles (MAM 3-Pack BPA Free Bottle, Boy, 5 Ounce) after I learned how easy the Avent bottles are. The MAM bottles work as intended, but are unnecessarily troublesome. When it came time to send my baby to day care for my return to work, I discovered just how frustrating the MAM bottles are. First of all, you have to make sure the bottom is screwed on **REALLY** tight, otherwise the water used to heat will mix with the contents of the bottle. This turns into such a pain - literally - when it comes time to take the bottle apart for washing. This extra thick, screw-on bottom makes warming the contents extra long compared to other bottles, such as Avent. Once you finally do get the milk warmed and take the MAM bottle out of the hot water, you have to be very careful not to burn yourself or your baby with the steaming water that collected in that screw-on bottom through the vent holes. Banging it out doesn't get all of it and makes too much noise for all those night time feedings or anytime for that matter. Using a wash or burp cloth to protect yourself and baby is yet another added hassle and one more thing to maneuver while trying to feed the baby.None of these issues exist with the Avent bottles. An extra ring is nothing compared to the base parts of the MAM bottles. Popping the lid on and off the Avent bottles is also another easy thing compared to MAM. When you're juggling a crying baby and a bottle at once, it's not convenient to have to use a counter edge to pop off a bottle's lid, but it's something I've had to resort to, unfortunately. Avent's lids are secure enough and prevent leaking without requiring a 2-hand operation.As an added bonus, Avent has a conversion kit that allows me to pump using my Ameda Purely Yours electric breast pump directly into any Avent bottle."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"The big 100 bar exceeds expectations in terms of the supplements it offers. What it fails at miserably is palatableness. Bear in mind that this is only true of this variety of bar. The texture is very sticky and almost clay like. And what are supposed to be chocolate chips, seemed to me like hard stones. It was absolutely horrible and I struggled to finish an entire bar.I would advise you to stay clear of this bar as there are other viable alternatives offered by Met-Rx which cost around the same amount of money. One of them is the Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal Meal Replacement Bar.(Super Cookie Crunch or Crispy Apple Pie). Both those bars tasted great and offered the same if not exceeding supplement value."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I've been buying these vitamins for a long time. I love the brand and their price and they deliver it right to my door and fast! I've tried to shop for this in Vitamin Shoppe and GNC but they never have this brand or the count or the great price. Definitely recommend it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I lead a high stress / high intensity lifestyle, and I'm sure this puts a taxing load on my body's vitamin needs. These vitamins are very well formulated using many high quality ingredients that most people probably overlook. Eg"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This my second time ordering the colonix kit. I was introduced by a co-worker who is a nutrition and fitness buff at the hospital that I work. If you follow the instructions it works as indicated. However one bit of advice take a probiotic pill in the am and night while on this product to ensure that you are replenishing your good bowel flora and drink lots of water.
health personal care,health care,cough cold,4.0,This chinese tea is great for preventing a cold or the flu. You drink it at the first signs of sniffle. And again the next day until you feel better. Great stuff.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I started making fondant cakes a few months ago. This works great for the finishing touches to the cakes without having to mix up your own colored frosting, which saves a ton of time!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"I guess I have a bigger nose than I thought. Whenever I read the reviews I thought the light leaking at the bottom wouldn't apply to me; Sadly, it does. It isn't a lot of light leaking, but it is just enough to annoy you. If you can manage to mold the mask a little bit more to fit your face, it's awesome. Super comfortable, doesn't smell (after you let it air out for a day), and well... it's a face mask - what else is there to say about it?"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,1.0,I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula. Stevia is just too bitter. I will not buy until it uses the old formula.
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,2.0,"This body wrap has an unpleasant and cheap outer fabric. Who knows what is in the inside....some little polymer beads, I believe. I have had far better wraps in the past. I will be sending this back. There should be more product info on line and on the box. I wouldn't have purchased it had I known it was entirely synthetic with a kind of brushed nylon fabric (the kind that catches the smallest rough area on a fingernail.) I am looking for a barley or rice filled wrap, as I have had in the past. They last a long time and seem to be a superior product."

It is so easy to use, folds down into a small box and is just perfect for travel or leaving with the babysitter! It is well worth the 20$ spent!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Hi,I found this kit to be complete. The material is sturdy and IMO quality. I mainly use the yoga mat since I only do yoga twice a week to maintain my flexibility. So far, it has remained in good shape, even in the desert heat and humidity. All in all, for the money, I'd buy this item again.Take care,Rob G"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a great product! I am a school teacher and used to get colds every 3 months, suffered from gas and gastritis. Although I ate yoghurt regularly it did not help much. The Garden of Life Primal Defense was recommended to me by an acupuncturist and it has helped immensley!! No more gas pain, irregularity, and the best NO COLDS!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"This cream is a very good product that helps heal skin, IF you want to smell like a Bento Box Lunch! STRONG sesame oil aroma."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I've enjoyed black tea all my life and have always hated flavored teas...until this one! I put a little cream in it along with half a pack of Sweet 'N Low and enjoy it every afternoon. I've had Bigelow's (as others have suggested) and they're both excellent. I'm on my 5th box of this and I love it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"The Caramel Nut Blast Balance bars are not a bad protein or nutrition bar, but they are nothing special either. As far as taste goes they are mediocre being kind of basic and bland. These do have a high amount of protein, 13g (28% of daily recommended value) which is a nice amount. The bars run a little on the small side (about 1.75 oz) and kind of high for calories at 210. Overall, I feel like the bars are just OK compared to others out there, and I would not likely purchase them again. There are plenty others out there that taste better, have fewer calories, etc. even other balance bars."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,I usually have a can in the evening if I am craving dessert. It helps make the hunger go away and is high in protein to keep me satisfied.Vanilla and chocolate are the best flavors though there is room for improvement flavor-wise. Banana tastes way too artificial. I'm not a fan of the artificial aftertaste these leave but overall it's manageable.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,1.0,"I use a lot of energy drinks (Jack3d, redbull, assault..etc). This is the worst energy drink you can have. It is just awful. First the crashing afterwards is maximized. i had to sleep for 2 days straight after this. No other energy drinks do that. Redbull and jack3d and Monster are all great. Worst part is, I did not even get that much kick out of it. It is the worst drink you can buy."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Stuff works great and for the price you can't beat it.It is a little gritty, but I don't find that a big deal. The micronized stuff dissolves better, but does the same job.I will but more of the same when I run out!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Normally, I don't really care to do these reviews. I actually wanted to take the time on this one. First and foremost, when it comes to a multivitamin, I can't take the normal grocery store stuff like Centrum, or Men's One a Day. I've tried a lot of multivitamins. I used to get an upset stomach when I'd take them. On some occasions, I would feel really jittery in the morning. With these however, I DO NOT see any of these side effects. It's best to take this with a full glass of water and some food. I do have to say, after taking this for 2 months, I feel amazing. I am a very active person too, so they fit right in to my diet/routine. I will never change my multivitamin. It's convenient and gives you just the right amount. I promise you, for this price, you are going to see a lot of benefits."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,"I highly recommend this product! The design is perfect - impossible to put in too far, easy to read, nice cover for the thermometer end. My baby doesn't even know his temperature is being checked. It provides accurate results really quickly and also saves the last reading, which can be helpful when you're dead tired with a sick baby on your hands."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I went to the Asian market looking for ginger tea because I was getting sick. Ginger tea supposedly helps you when you are sick (fight infection, inflammation, etc). The Intra Instant ginger tea comes in convenient little packets. The taste isn't too strong and tastes good. The product is from Indonesia so you don't have to worry too much about tainted food. I would buy this product again. Also, the product has 90 calories per packet. However, fewer calories would be better."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I bought this for my mom, and almost got her sent to emergency room.She had experienced skin rash, swelling on face and limbs after first pill.On the other hand, she didn't have any problem with the Nature Made Vitamin D-3, 2000IU, 90 Softgels."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Purchased this product because it was relatively low on calories compared to other products and overall it had good ratings. After trying it, it actually tastes really good when mixed with milk (or almond milk). I generally take it immediately after working out and before dinner. Seems to help with both weight loss and muscle gain. 5 pounds will easily last me two months having it once a day. For the price, I really can't complain. I plan on continuing to buy it."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I consider myself an avid tea drinker and although I don't care for most Celestial teas I do love this one.The flavor and aroma are really great and I like the hint of sweetness as well.You can't go wrong with this tea!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"I've tried a few protein shakes on the market. I've heard great things about ON Gold Standard and their quality. I had been taking some Intek Evolution protein, which has great ingredients, and tastes amazing (I look forward to my post-workout shake). However, at $60/5lb jug, it was getting pretty pricey.I accidentally ordered two jugs in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor (wanted the Double Chocolate which i hear is decent). It's not that the ingredients aren't good, I can't STAND the flavor. It's by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever had. I've tried everything, water, milk, almond milk, soy milk, even adding a bit of cocoa powder to it. Nothing. I now dread my post-work out shake. I cry to myself every time I see the unopened jug sitting there, waiting for me to reluctantly open it and consume the hellish powder that lurks inside. I'd give it away to someone but that's just plain cruel.If you don't care about flavor, or simply have some sort of strange, mutilated taste buds, go ahead and get the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor. It's cheap. However, i'd rather spend double the price for something I can stand. With Intek Protein, I found myself enjoying it to satisfy my sweet tooth, it was the perfect desert drink. Not so much of Gold Standard. Very Sad."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"My 12 month old son was leaking through his diaper EVERY night without waking. Soaked jammies, blanket, sheets, all the way through the mattress pad. We tried to limit fluids close to bedtime, no luck. I had tried buying up a size, he's already in a four, so I bought up to fives. No help. I tried other brands, we use Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies, Luvs.....nothing worked. So I ordered these diaper pads and wow!! He has been dry every morning for the last week. His diapers are enormous in the morning, but he is dry! I read all the reviews good and bad, and decided to try them with some sceptisim. I am now here to order more. They are plenty big for his size four diapers. I usually put the pad more in the front of the diaper, he's a boy, but it could easily put more central for the baby girls too. If you have leaky diaper issues try these!! My washing machine has already thanked me :0)"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I actually ordered this because I wanted to make my own natural dishwasher detergent. It worked really well with my recipe. It also worked well as a replacement for lemishine, which is what I usually add to my dishwasher to help clean due to the hard water in Phoenix. I got a lot for my money, and it has lasted for a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to change over to natural cleaning products."

I was surprised that these are nothing like the zand products. These are chalky pellets and the orange flavor did not mix well with the other ingredients.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I purchased this item because it is no longer available in the stores in my area. I wanted to try a divinity candy recipe I had and it called for a box of white frosting mix. The candy turned out real well, the only drawback is, that it takes several days to ""dry"" out. But it still beats the other recipes I have tried.....and failed at. ;("
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,"I was very disappointed when this tea arrived. It is too fine to use in most of my tea making devices, and that is disappointing. It seeped through 3 different infusers, making the tea not-drinkable. I was able to make it using some paper t-sacs, and it tasted pretty good. I just prefer my loose tea to be in leaf form, like the Twinnings Earl Grey is. Because I prefer using infusers and I hate using t-sacs, and I didn't pay much for it, I'm sadly considering dumping it out and using the tin to store other tea."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,Wow... I'm not gluten insensitive but my girlfriend has celiacs. We recently got a bread maker and have tried a few packaged bread mixes. I can honestly say that this is easily the best gf bread mix and is better than most whole wheat gluten breads or regular breads you purchase from the supermarket. It has caused me to give up normal breads and join my girlfriend in her gluten-free diet. Bob's is good too but (very spongey) but Gluten Free Pantry's sandwich bread has amazing flavor and that homemade bread texture. The store bought gf breads aren't even close to being on the same level as this product. Simply great!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I first received a bottle of this from my mom and I wasn't convinced I should try it. then I got pregnant and was looking for a good multivitamin that didn't have iron because my iron levels were fine and it causes constipation. Anyway, I started taking just one a day and was pleasantly surprised by the increase in energy and just over all good feeling I had. As my pregnancy has progressed I have increased to the full dosage recommended on the back (three tablets) and am feeling way better then I did with my first pregnancy. I was taking just a regular prescription prenatal and didn't even continue throughout the whole pregnancy because I felt no different when I wasn't taking it. I really love this Whole Food supplement and will be taking it for a while now while breast feeding and on into the future I'm sure."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have tried several multivitamins and now for the last two years it is the only one I buy. While no I am not pregnant I have issues with leg cramps and this was a recommendation from my doctor. I love it and recommend to anyone who asks-and even those who don't. Amazon has the best price out there by far and it is true you get what you pay for.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"This pad is a CareforTM brand underpad. I searched for a long time for a drawsheet or underpad that was latex-free, very large and able to protect my skin from perspiring due to the hot hospital bed mattress. This product fits the bill. It is perfect. Of course, I order the 36x54 and the 36x72 sizes for my purposes. I use these pads as drawsheets to protect my skin from skin breakdown and to ease repositioning me by my caregivers. The ""slick"" side of the pad glides effortlessly over the bed sheet. The soft, absorbent side is comfortable and prevents sweating from the waterproof mattress covering. The pad does not bunch up or move. It also washes well."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,After reading up on ACV for a few months I finally tried it. I have acne and I bought it for the sole purpose of getting my skin clear. For the past 3 months I have been using it and I can say it has been a miracle cure for my skin. I typically take it 3 times a day (1 tablespoon in about 2oz to 4oz of water) and it does the job. Literally in 2 days my skin showed signs of clearing. Just recently I took a 10 day trip to Japan and I left the bottle because I was unsure about being able to travel with it. My breakouts slowly came back and upon returning home I started taking it immediately and overnight my skin was back to normal. This is one product that I can say for sure has an effect on acne. It also makes me feel a little full if I drink it before a meal.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I purchased this oil, and mixed with water and baking soda to create my own air freshener. Using only a few drops for an 8+ oz bottle, I'll have months (years?) of air freshener at a fraction of the cost for commercially bottled spray air fresheners.Shipment was on time, and all I hoped for."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,"I ordered Black Truffle oil and got the white instead which I do not like as much. This however is smooth for its lower price which is nice. I cant afford to buy the super chic oils and this comes very close to the wonderful taste you pay hefty for. I have enjoyed using the white, but I like the fuller bold flavor of black."
health personal care,health care,first aid,4.0,"I received this kit (the .5) 3 days before the expected delivery date. I like it a lot. Fits well in my Maxpedition Jumbo, which is my EDC/GHB. I checked the expiration dates on every thing and I have about 18 months of good dates, which is better than many preassembled kits. I check all my first aid products annually any how. I had room to add a bit more in the areas of pain relief, burn gel and antibiotic ointment. I can barely feel the the weight of the kit. I plan on ordering the .9 or the weekender for my car. I really like this product and the fact that there is a little room in the bag to customize it a bit."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My lactation consultant recommended these supplements to get my milk jump started and WOW! I went from having 3 oz per pumping to 5 oz in just a few days!! I now can easily pump 7+ ounces every 4 hours and equate it to these! I have been happily freezing milk once or twice a week which is a huge comfort given my son is a big eater... This is the very best price you'll find anywhere beating retail and eBay by a landslide. As a tip - do take these with very little water before and after (15 mins each) for best results then follow up with lots of fluids throughout the day and you'll be impressed. I have had no trouble digesting these and zero issues with my son reacting to the supplements. We are both VERY grateful for the increase in my milk supply and i tell nursing mom's as much as I can how effective they are. The nursing teas are a mild version - steeping/brewing herbs instead of ingesting the extracts is night and day. I still drink the teas but More Milk Plus capsules work 10x better!
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,"THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT, BUT, DO NOT ORDER IT FROM THIS COMPANY. THE PRODUCT PAGE SAID THE AMOUNT WAS FOR 2 TUBES.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Cod liver oil is vile tasting, plain and simple. Even so, the health properties are worth it.Cod liver oil is a rich source of Vitamin D and has long been used for elimination issues. It does keep your system flowing and going. I have learned in recent times that studies have shown that cod liver oil helps people who suffer from asthma. I found that it helps with allergies, as I don't have asthma. It has certainly been an arrow pointing health upward. If you want 4000 IU, then take 1 T twice a day. (2000 IU per tablespoon). It's vile tasting, yeah, but be sure to drink a FULL glass of water afterward to wash the taste away. (I didn't like the flavored versions as I never found any taste that could meld with cod liver oil).Norway is the site of healthy seafood/fish products.I highly recommend this product."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We purchased this when our 5 month old started showing interest in solid food. He wasn't quite ready for the big highchair, but he was ready for purees, and this was the perfect fit. It's easy to ""install"" on any chair. It has a 3-point strap for the baby and high sides, so when the tray snaps on, I feel confident that he's safe if I need to move a few feet away. We've also taken it to restaurants when we weren't sure of their on-site kid accessories and it's been great. For $25, I'm thrilled."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,I loved this product.. I crushed up a bunch between my fingers and put it in my homemade buttercream frosting and they came out beautiful! I took a star away because you have to use a lot to get it to show because if you just sprinkle it on top they look like flakes and not sparkles even when you crush them.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I must say that I was not up for trying these out at first. I was just going to ""hand wash and save my money"" pshhh yeah right. Once I had my baby I had no time to hand wash anything. I use the dishwasher now! Needless to say I went and purchased these from target because I needed something right away to sterilize my breast pump to use it because I don't put my baby's things in the dishwasher. I have two different branded double breast electric pumps; Evenflo and playtex and i can fit all the parts per breastpump per bag at one time and in 3 minutes they are hot and steaming clean ready to use!! The easiest best money ever spent!!! you get 20 uses out of each bag and that is a good deal for the price because the pack comes in 5. that is a 100 times to sterilize...YAY!!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"This product really helps with let down of full breasts and helps with the production of milk. I love how easy it is to pop into the microwave and place on your breasts. It smells a little funny, since its natural flax. I already told other friends about this and think that its a good to have for breast feeding moms. So glad I stumbled upon it on amazon and decided to try it!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,5.0,"I recently became a vegetarian, saying bye to meat was not hard as I barely ate any before, but saying goodbye to cheese products that contain rennet and other things like sweets with gelatin was HARD! my resolve would almost falter everytime I went through the cookies and candy isle. one of my friends told me about Annie's cheddar bunnies (I used to eat goldfish like crazy)and their fruit snacks (gummies without gelatin) I found them easily enough at Whole foods and other natural markets by my house and even though I usually pay 4.00 dollars a box, they are sooooo worth it! the taste is amazing, they use non-animal enzymes!!! and best of all they are non- gmo! (I am trying to eat only non-gmo foods) I tell you the box doesn't even last the day, and as long as the company will continue using non-gmo ingredients and non animal enzymes they will continue to have my support."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"This neck wrap is great. I have a spinal cord injury and other spinal issues and now I have neck pain sometimes. I even use a wheelchair. This product has greatly relieved my neck pain including on days that my pain is worse. As a matter of fact, I hardly have any pain at all after using this product."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,Using this tool daily has helped keep my plantar fasciitis under control. Yes it works best with a rug underneath. Just grab one of your bathroom mats and use it while watching tv or surfing the net.It does not feel good like a massage. It feels like the treatment used by my chiropracter. Using the wheel gets at the right knots and muscles. You control the pressure. Best $20 spent in a long time.I recommend you try this tool. Use it daily along with stretching in the morning.

I cannot take the acid of Vit C, thus had also ordered Ester C, non acidic. Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also. I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time. I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon. Amazon, LOVE IT!!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"I have an 11x21 pack used on my shoulders, neck, and upper back. After about 3 months of casual daily use it started leaking its guts out. Others have have problems with them too.From reading other negative reviews, two suggestions from other owners stand out.One, the Physical Therapist who introduced one owner to the product line cautioned her to put the pac in an airtight bag when in the freezer, as the dry, cold air pulls something out of the vinyl over time, making it prone to seam separation.Two, another owner says vinyl repair patches, available at sporting goods stores, will stop the leaks. Another user tried silicone gel, duct tape, and other approaches to no avail. I tried duct tape, but the gel found its way several inches along the seam and finally appeared.They are supposedly warrantied for a year, but after about a week nobody from the company has returned my email about returning.My advice"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,granola trail mix bars,5.0,I hate making breakfast so these bars are perfect for winter mornings. Why save the flavor of pumpkin and spice for only the holiday season? These are delicious year round. They do however contain quite a bit of sugar so maybe they should be a treat and not a staple. Either way I'm happy when I eat one because these are a source of Omega-3. I can't see why anyone would say these are bland. They are bursting with flavor. My box says best before OCT 2012 so it is a fresh box. I could see how these would not taste good if they were stale.~The Rebecca Review

Until Amazon it was difficult to obtain them in the USA so I bought them a carton at a time whenever I could obtain them.

grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,2.0,I was excited about this flavor but so disappointed when I tried it. These are super-dense and really gross tasting. The brownie crunch and peanut butter (both chunky and creamy) varieties are a million times more edible.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"Before my gallbladder was removed, my stomach/diaphram would get enlarged after any-sized meal. After my gallbladder was removed, my entire stomach would get enlarged, and bloated, as if the tissues were inflammed. And my stomach seemed very sensitive to wheat products... even a dash of soy sauce.I did research online and found that ox bile could help. I ordered another brand for about 6 months. And it worked alright, but the price was too high. So, last month, I purchased a bottle of Nutricology's Ox Bile, 500 mg. And I'm pretty happy with the product. I've gone through a bottle, and can say that this seems to work a little better than the other brand. I like that these are capsules, rather than tablets. And though I still try to avoid wheat, when I do have wheat, with this product, I am not suffering afterwards. That means a lot to me.So, I'm ordering my second bottle.

I usually drink 2or3 of these a day."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I bought this tea from viewing Dr. OZ and he recommended drinking it for help burning belly fat. I'm not so sure how that is working for the fat burning being as I just started it, but so far one thing I can say is it has been surpressing my appetite when I drink it. The taste is smooth for me, but the smell isnt the best. Overall it works for me!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is by far the best TASTING protein powder I've ever used. I've tried protein powders from EAS, MuscleTech, GNC, ProsSource NitroWhey, Body Fortress sold through WalMart,etc and I find Syntha6 beats them all. I've only tried the Chocloate and Mochaccino flavors however. If you like coffee and are a regular at Starbucks you will love the Mochaccino flavor. Syntha6 does have more carbs than others and as another review states, it lacks some of the vitamins and minerals that Muscle Milk includes in their product. I don't find this to be a major con since one should be getting most of their nutrients from a balanced diet and add multivatamins to their nutrition anyway. I haven't found this powder hard to mix as other have stated. If you use a shaker cup or, IMO, GNC's ball-shaker cup, you'd have no problems at all. I can't attest as to how it serves as a weight gainer, or the like since I use it mainly as a meal replacement.All in all this is a great product. My only complaint about BSN's Syntha 6 is that some flavors, Mochaccino being one, are available only in the 2.91 lbs container and not the 5 lbs."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"BE AWARE WHEN ORDERING FROM THIS SELLER, PRODUCT COUNTS AND SHIPPING COSTS ARE NOT AS STATED.These jars were perfect. Exactly what my Mom had been looking for. Unfortunately, the seller does not honor stated product counts and prices. So I felt I had to give this item 1 star. Dollar wise, it's small potatoes, but the inconsistencies of the seller, should not be tolerated on a site like this. I make a lot of purchases from Amazon.com, and I have never had an issue like this. Nor have I ever been told that the prices for the product or the shipping are not as stated. I've looked at the product page numerous times, if I've missed were it says ""5 jars only"", I'd like my fellow shoppers to let me know. Again this has nothing to do with the value of the jars, simply the value of your word.This is the exchange between myself and the seller, after I did not receive all the jars as advertised.MY ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO THE SELLER:My order of 12 Ointment Jar Glass Amber 25 ml (.84 oz) remains incomplete.I received 5 of the jars, very soon after my order was placed. Iunderstand that you split the shipment ""to reduce shipping charges"".However, my entire order was to arrive, no later than February 29th. It isnow the end of the day, March 1st, and I still have not received theremaining 7 jars. Please advise.FROM THE SELLER:Sorry for the misunderstanding, however, this was for 5 jars only whichwas the last of that inventory. The shipping for 12 jars is $13.65 andAMAZON does NOT allow me to a) change the shipping or b) change theoriginal description which is why I put it in the comments that it wasonly 5 jars. The shipping for 5 jars is $5.49 (which is what you paid).This is comments from another buyer regarding same item.""These jars are well-made. My only complaint is that I spent more forshipping than the price of the jars.""dominic p., February 17, 2012I can sell you 7 (or more) of the bigger jars for $10 that I have listedhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VI94TU if you are interested orreturn the 5 and I'll issue a refund.SECOND EMAIL TO THE SELLER:There is no misunderstanding. I ordered 12 Jars.""Ointment Jar Glass Amber 25 ml (.84 oz) - 12 Per Bag"" It says 12 perbag-12 what exactly, if not 12 jars?Also on my delivery slip it states ""Comments"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I say that tentatively. It seems to be helping my skin somewhat. I heard that Burdock Root can help balance hormones. I will have to see how it works in the long run, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. What I don't like is that you only get 100 capsules. You have to take 2 of these suckers 3 times a day. 6 capsules a day times 30 days is 180 capsules. It would be more cost effective for me personally if there 180 or even 200 capsules in the bottle."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,the sweetener seems to be of average quality. the cost is more expensive than at the local store. So if you have a hard time getting this where you live it may work out for you but please compare the price at the local grocery before buying. thank you for your time.
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,2.0,"This may be TMI but I have to share. The only time I ever saw fertile fluids was when I used this. I've been ttc for a few months and have been very aware of all my ""fluids"" and I never achieved the mythical egg white. (Even while drinking grapefruit juice or taking mucinex). I almost accepted that I was one of the ones that didn't get EW CM but I figured I'd give this a shot. For me this worked but I think it also modified my ovulation date. This last cycle I used Fertile CM my chart had a crazy quasi rise and then dropped 3DPO and then another rise before I eventually got my period 4 days early. (My cycle has been like clockwork with ovulation on CD 13-14 and a 12 day luteal phase) I have no idea what happened. I'm going to try one more month before I blame these pills but wanted to share as a cautionary tale."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"This product makes me feel better after suffereing from fatigue, joint pain, missed periods and mood swings but the only downsize is it causes me to have vaginal bleeding. After being on it a week I started bleeding like a period and have'nt stopped for 2 weeks so I'm afraid I'll have to go off of it! To bad because I felt better but I'm gonna get Anemic with all the blood loss. I also started having some eyelash, eyebrow and top of head hair loss.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"Dymatize iso-100 protein isolate is an ok product. I don't know if the vanilla version of this tastes any batter but the tast of this protein powder isn't great. I like that it is almost 90% pure protein by weight and that it has some BCAA's and glutamine. The cookie bits are too hard to bite, it's almost like you're biting little rocks.Overall, It's just an average product."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I agree with the other reviews that Muscle Milk does contain more sugar and fat than most other protein supplements, but you're talking about 6 grams of fat per serving, and just two grams of sugar. Not that much. If you're on a super strict diet, then fair enough but if you're using this as a meal replacement or a post-workout recovery drink I think it fits the bill perfectly. I also like how it has glutamine already in the mix, not very much so I still supplement it separately as well but still a nice touch have an amino acid like that in a protein shake.I would also recommend looking intoBeta Ecdysterone Bulk Powder 30 Gramsif your goal is increased muscle tissue. This one actually increases the ability to signal muscle cells and releases growth hormone, also increases the metabolism naturally. I don't believe in taking anabolic steroids or anything like that but I will however, still add the necessary components to build muscle and I have always preferred to go to the ones that have been proven to work (and are legal).So, if your looking for the best tasting protein (i.e. actually tastes like a chocolate milkshake), then you can do no better than Muscle Milk. One tip is to put some ice in the blender when mixing, makes it taste almost like a malt. And unless you're in a serious bulking phase, drinking this post-workout makes the most sense, since your body will suck up the extra sugar and fat that make this shake taste so good and use it for recovery."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality. It is not drinkable plain. Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible. In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.What should you drink? Anything you like. I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"". It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff. By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink."

When Wondfo gave a negative result according to their directions ( test line lighter than control line), Clear Plan gave me a straight up positive.Don't waste your important TIME with these.

health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,"Wow! This stuff is a miracle! I feel like I have my life back! And I do! I will always have this stuff in my possession and keep using it until the time I finally go thru menopause!If my writing a review here helps just one other person, it's all worth it!After all, it was thru someone else's post like this on amazon, about a similar product (different brand name) that I found my cure! I can't thank her enough for writing her review on here!This natural cream was a simple solution to severe, heavy, non-stop bleeding that went on for months at a time without stopping! My obgyn doctors office when I called, said well if you're bleeding longer than 90 days, call back and we'll see you. Otherwise, you are having peri-menopause bleeding. (and what the heck was perimenopause anyway? I was 47 years old at the time this started, and I had never heard of it!) So I wasn't happy with that answer (I was on 51 days of non stop bleeding at this point and losing my mind, was so tired and tired of bleeding). Called another obgyn and was told the same thing on the phone, if it's longer than 90 days to call back and they would make me an appointment! I thought they were both nuts!The bleeding finally stopped, on day 88....I had 6 days off and my period started up again! Then it lasted for another 4 months, non stop! Times of super heavy clots big as your palm of your hand (sorry for being so to the point, but it's true!) and incredibly forceful heavy bleeding that kept me inside my home unable to go out and having to break appointments, lunch dates, etc. and turned an outgoing girl into a home hermit! Sometimes at night it was so bad I was up all night in the bathroom passing huge clots and having heavy bleeding that would not let me sleep. Thank God I work mostly from home and could be home during this whole thing that went on, though I did alot of rearranging of my work schedule. And I didn't want to tell anyone, I was too embarrassed to talk about it.Let me tell you, I have gone thru a year and a half of this crazy bleeding and even became iron deficient (I am taking iron daily now) and I am an active, athletic girl! Using this natural progesterone cream has stopped the heavy bleeding and now I am back on regular 28 day cycles! And the clots are gone! The heavy bleeding is gone!I have my period now for about 6 days and it goes away like it should. Took me 4 months of using this cream however to get back to that cycle, so if at first this doesn't work for you then don't give up on it!!! You have to stick with it and give it a chance to rectify things that are out of balance in your body.I am estrogen dominant and found out thru a saliva test at a local health food store. (I had however, already started to use this cream). And I also found that you can't start missing the morning or evening application (I am putting it on twice a day still and I'm on month 7 now of using it) to keep the progesterone in your body balanced or your levels will drop and your period will then arrive.If you are having bleeding issues, I urge you to give this a try. I am so happy I found these amazon reviews thru an internet search on my problem and decided to try this cream. I first bought it at my local natural health food store, but now I buy this one on amazon all the time as it saves me money and it arrives at my doorstep. Suggested reading"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,Sumac is a single spice not a mixture of different spices and majority comes in a black or very dark colour unlike this brand which is a lighter colour. It is used mainly in Persian dishes with rice and kabob. I use sumac in majority of my dishes since I love the taste and the smell of sumac so much. It is not hot at all. It is not sweet. It is a different spice but absolutely a necessity for me. Once in a while you will get a very small seed that you can not consume but that is the nature of this spice. Bravo.

I'm on week 2 using so I can't tell yet if is helping or not. I was told by my dr to use it since I don't eat meat and it might help with achy joints or muscles. I try to mix it in orange juice and inflammacore but the taste is still strong. May be next time I will try plain so I can cook in my food.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This ""comment"" is just my idea of making the Liquid Vitex enjoyable.Quick background:I'm 28, I have had irregular periods for the last 6 yrs since i had my first child. they range from 30 days to 5 months between cycles. I am obese @ 5'6 211 lbs. I was diagnosed with PCOS just 6 months ago, and my husband and I have been trying to conceive for 11 mos. My fertility doctor wants to put me on Metformin to help me ovulate regularly. She also wants me to lose weight. I plan to spend the next 4-6 mos losing weight before I begin Metformin. I read tons of reviews on Vitex and thought while Im actively trying to lose weight, i would like to try Vitex (a natural hormone regulator) and just see what happens. I purchased a very similar product Gaia Vitex Elixir for Women at Whole Foods just yesterday 3/18/12 so i can't comment on its efficiency yet. But I do know how awful it tastes and i figured a way to take it without the awful smell and taste.-The dosage is 30 drops which equals to about 1/2 a tspn which i use a little medicine cup to measure.-I pour the Liquid Vitex into a 6oz microwave safe plastic cup.- I fill a 6 oz. cup 1/2 way with water-the other 1/2 with milk,- i add a tblspn of honey- 4 shakes of cinnamon (the 1 in the little McCormick container).- I warm it up in the microwave and drink.***it doesn't taste bad at all and the only after taste is that of the cinnamon. I take Vitex 4x's a day (the suggested use is 3-4xs a day. I will give you an update after my next cycle.****"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,I got this tea a few days ago and it has great taste...has a mild citrus taste. Love love love! Will come back in 4 weeks to review the weight loss aspect as today is my first day!Update (almost 2 weeks later)
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I purchased this for home use where I make one gallon of ice tea at a time. The individual pouches make 5 gallon. So, I had to cut each one open and use a tea strainer to make gallon sizes. The quality and taste of the tea are better than almost anything else I've had. Just beware that the size is meant to brew 5 gallons at a time."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"My hubby and I both have physically taxing jobs and need more energy and less of an appetite. We picked this up at Wal-Mart deciding it looked like the best energy/metabolism boost available in our budget. We took the pills the way they're recommended and they work for us! We've both lost weight since we started taking them (2 weeks ago) and neither of us have gotten nauseous from the pills. Hubby has a very sensitive stomach and is alergic to a lot of foods so the fact that he doesn't have bad reactions to it is great.I read through the other reviews and yes, taking more than recommended will make you jittery and make your heart speed up. Yes, you will sweat without reason but not ALL the time and yes, if you dont take them with a meal they can make you feel sick but that's true with ANY energy pill!!!I'll even be really honest with you. Hubby and I haven't changed our diet AT ALL and we've lost weight. No, it's not a miracle worker but it gives you the energy you're looking for and the metabolism boost you need. Its true that it does make you really thirsty and hubby says it makes him more hungry but i've noticed he eats less, more often which is actually better than what he was doing previously.So if you're wondering if this is the energy/metabolism boosting pill for you then I'd say, when used right, it has the potential to be a great thing!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have suffered with asthma for years.I suffered an attack last year and had to be hospitalized in March of 2011 after the second visit to the emergency room in one day. In October I suffered another attack and had to go to the emergency room. Ever since then I have had problems with Asthma having to use my rescue inhaler sometimes three times a day which is not good at all. I did research and was hoping to find something that could help me. I had heard about Quercetin a long time ago. I have tried a few natural things but they did'nt seem to help at all. I decided to try this product. I bought it on Wednesday and started using it the next day which was Thursday. On Friday by the end of the day I noticed that I had'nt used my inhaler. It is now Monday and I still have not had to use my inhaler. I am over joyed. I wish that I would have bought this when I first heard about it. I could have saved myself years of suffering. I feel like I have a new set of lungs my breathing is smooth and easy. On Saturday some chemicals were used on my job it was really strong. However it did not make me wheeze one bit. I owe it all to this amazing product. I highly recommend this. I am just so happy.

I was told by a homopathic to ""check your bocy temperature b/4 you get out of bed for a week and if your temperature is low then you do have a thyroid problem"". Sure enough, my temp was low every day for 7 days, lowest being *92. So, it's been 3 weeks on this meds and my temp is still the same, haven't lost 1 lb. and just cant tell a difference one way or another.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"I was considering buying this product until I noticed it has MSG. ""Yeast Extract"" is another name for MSG for those that don't know. I don't necessarily have a problem with MSG. What I have a problem with is manufacturers using different names to conceal the fact that an ingredient is in the product.And just to play both sides, MSG is actually considered safe for 99% of the population according to several studies(please do your own research to confirm). However, I don't like being lied to, so this food is off my list."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This combo protein seems to be doing a pretty decent job. I only have 2 complaints. The flavor is good, but too sweet when mixed into a smoothie, and it contains a lot of fat and cholesterol compared to other protein powders. With that being said, it does contain 3 types of protein to aid you right after your workout, a little while after, and even later yet. What I'm trying to say is, not all of it gets absorbed into your body right away which is good. Overall, I think it's a good mix."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,3.0,I have been doing the cookie diet as part of a diet/exercise plan for around two months. I have lost weight. After eating the Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal cookies non-stop I was looking for a break and tried these. They're not terrible... but no where near as good as the Oatmeal Raisin and Chocolate chip. On the plus side they are still WAYYY better then the cranberry orange ones.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply."

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I bought this for my honeymoon cruise. We were going on excursions where we would be walking around Mayan ruins, which ends up being several miles of walking per site. My wife has a tendency to get blisters, so I was glad that this kit came with moleskin. The kit is small and light enough to be negligible as far as I am concerned. I just tossed it in a small zipper pouch in my camera backpack and forgot about it. Sure enough, the first day out my wife got a blister on the ball of her foot, and it was hurting her to the point that should couldn't walk. I pulled out the pre-cut moleskin and she put it on. She immediately felt better and we were able to continue uninterrupted. That alone was worth the $10 I payed for the kit. As a bonus, one night before dinner one of the straps on her dress broke. She asked if I had a safety pin, and of course I didn't, because why the hell would I? Then I remembered that this kit came with a few, and I saved the day again.This kit is well worth the money if you need something small."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"At one of our Brio Birth classes we were talking about easing discomforts of pregnancy, and the instructor mentioned Papaya Enzyme as a heartburn remedy. I decided to try it out. I've had heartburn pretty much all through my second trimester, so I've had many opportunities to use these. They work very well.If I already have heartburn, I chew three tablets. If I anticipate getting heartburn--like, there was a while where every time I would lie down in bed at night I would get heartburn--then, I chew two before the heartburn starts, and that prevents it. It works almost immediately.Last week I got a cold and I pulled out the list of ""pregnancy approved medications"" that my midwife gave me at my first prenatal appointment to see what I could take for my cold. I also noticed that under the ""Heartburn"" section, she had listed papaya enzyme as well.I highly recommend papaya enzyme to any other pregnant ladies who are dealing with heartburn! These are pregnancy approved, very economical, they work really well, and they are delicious!"

It was negative in the morning, but turned to be positive in the evening.Secondly it's accurate for me. I get pregnant just with the first month try.last but not least, I love the gift for pregnancy test. I have had a low fever 26 days after my LMP. It felt like a flu or cold. I thought it might be a signal of early pregnancy, so I tried the pregnancy test before taking any medicine. it turned out to be positive, even at this early stage. One week later, i have had my first blood test by my doctor and confirmed that I am pregnant!!!"

Where to place and what orientation should be used? Spenco won't tell you. Their website advises you to ""Place in shoes, green side up just behind the ball of foot. Trim with scissors if necessary."" That's it. If that's enough info for you to use this product correctly then maybe these are for you. Spenco, would putting a simple diagram up on your website kill you?"

Like the last climactic number of a dramatic musical, it never fails to be bold and strongly felt. I want to take pictures and post them on the internet with captions like ""see what I made!!!"", but that would be probably not be appreciated.The effects are also really tangible. I can literally see the gunk it clears out of my body and am really impressed with the results, having done different kinds of cleanses for years. I feel lighter and my energy levels are picking up. I might even be loosing fat.Highly recommended."

After a few uses, the shapes were getting a bit warped-looking and I needed an extra set of breast shields to take to work, so I bought these. I actually like these better than the Soft Fits! They do not bend like the Soft Fits do, and apparently I pump milk faster with these (probably because it doesn't yield like the Soft Fits do, and being rigid, applies more pressure to the breast). I liked these so much that I bought another set to keep at home as well. I also like the fact that these come in different sizes, while Soft Fits are only available as one size (24mm). I highly recommend these for anyone with the Medela Freestyle pump!"

I'm a 31 year old single mother of 2 children and have been absolutely bogged down with stress every day. I literally felt as though my head would explode 4-5 times per day.

I saw this herbal supplement on the Dr. Oz show and it was actually on an episode for ""Supplements that blast belly fat"". He did mention that this particular supplement helped control cortisol levels and, in turn, doubles as stress relief. I immediately got online and purchased this. After the first capsule I noticed a somewhat calming effect. After 3 or 4 days, I was able to handle ""noise"" again. This mother used to yell several times a day over seemingly nothing...I can't remember the last time I yelled. My children are happier, my family sees a huge difference....*I* am happier!! To get such fantastic results from a supplement and not have to be medicated? I am ecstatic and I will definitely go so far as to say that this has changed my life and my family's life. If you are so stressed you are just at your wit's end...DO IT. BUY THIS. You wont regret it!!"

I have been using the chocolate flavor for over 3 years. This vanilla is just a bit too much flavor-wise. It should taste better if you plan on adding fruits and such to it, but still. The chocolate tastes so much better. I have no reason to buy this again as long as I can get the chocolate. Overall regardless of taste, this is still a great product nutrition wise."

I'm a heat wimp when it comes to spices, but I still love ginger!This tea provides a delicious ginger flavor that can't be ignored without an overwhelming pepper note. I agree with the other reviewer - the other ingredients in this brew can't be detected and identified individually by my untrained senses, but I think they work together to make a more mellow, rounded tea flavor with a sweeter scent.If you want to try a ginger tea that isn't too intense, this is absolutely the tea for you."

From now on I will not buy any products from Amazon until I see the ingedient list which, of course, was not on the description page for this product!

If you get it on healthy skin it will disolve it too. I use a tooth pick edge to scrape a bit off the top of the stick and use that to spread it on just the wart. then cover with a bandaid, or a Dr. Scholl's palntar wart cushion for a plantar wart. YAY!"

Our 6 month old son loves this chair - it gives him the option to sit next to us when we are out, instead of at the end of a table. Plus, you don't have to use the crusty highchairs that are offered when dining out. Also, it is the perfect solution for when we go camping in our travel trailer, as it will hook onto our table in there, and now we don't have to worry about lugging along a bouncer or highchair to sit him in. Everywhere we go, people are commenting on how great of an idea the chair is and how they wished they would have had that when their kids needed a highchair."

It takes 12 minutes just to heat up to the medium setting, and the pad doesn't hold its shape well at all, frequently requiring tedious reshaping by hand. A heating pad is supposed to be something in the background that doesn't require a lot of thought or effort, and this item falls well short of that.I'm tempted to return it, but it does actually work, so I guess we'll keep it as a spare that I hope we never have to use."

I looked and looked to see how many bottles of these I would receive for the price. Apparently, only one. I found a bottle of the same thing at Walmart (finally) last month for about $5.00. Apparently, the vendor is making a healthy profit on these. I put the Extra Strength orange sugar free Tums on my wish list until I get to Walmart to see if they still have the chocolate Smoothie. You can get 4 bottles of 80 count each of the orange chewables for $21.96. Two stars because of the price."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I tried the vanilla flavour of this product mixed with about a cup of frozen berries and a cup of milk. It tasted pretty good. I know a lot of people are complaining about the flavour without any additions, and I haven't tried it plain, but if it's this easy to make it taste good and add a little bit more goodness with the antioxidants, fibre, and vitamins of the berries, why wouldn't you just add a little something? Then you get some fruit and some veg for breakfast. I also like that there isn't any fat in the product as it means I can have a few healthy fats from nuts or flaxseed along with my morning shake without overdoing it on my fats intake. Overall, I think its an easy way to add a bit more nutrition to my morning breakfast smoothie without sacrificing taste or calories in the process."

In the last 3 months I have watched the price of this TRIPLE. YES, TRIPLE. Anyone have any idea's as to why? I have asked Amazon but the only explanation I get is, ""Seller's can sell for whatever they wish.""

The smell of rose in this syrup is great and it tastes wonderful. The baked cake turned out not as ""pretty"" looking because it lacks the pink color but it taste and smells great! And what's the point of home baking? You want something natural and healthy for your family right?I add this to milk and waffle too and it is amazing.Can't recommend more and I will only buy rose syrup from Barry farm. I love Barry farm and would look into more of their products."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,1.0,"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"

I have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time.

I am happy to know that as I get bigger I still have two looser settings I can move to. I haven't had issues with back pain, but the weight of my abdomen really gets to me at work - I am a nurse. I was at the point where I was holding my belly up when walking around. This belt has made such a difference. i am able to walk comfortably and feel supported. I wear it over my scrub pants or jeans on my days off. I am not sure how it would feel next to skin, it does have a soft side, but again, I haven't tried it."

I had been buying from Vitamin Shoppe until I found this price. Last check on the VS site was $15.99 for 24 ounces. As far as I can tell, the quality is comparable.Since I use the product daily, I elected to get regular deliveries which lowered the price some more. Very satisfied with this product and definitely satisfied with the price."

It's very durable and it has a slight bounce. I would recommend this gel squeeze ball to anyone looking for a way to exercise an injured finger. I use it on the bus, train, and work. Co-workers are nosy so they will probably ask why do you have it. You can always tell them it's a stress ball. Hahaha."

I contacted the supplier and they gave me a refund right away which was good. So I am still looking for a product like this to have with me on hikes.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"Just got our first shippment of the 15 packs and we couldn't be more pleased. These little seeds have excellent flavor. They are crunchy and are very, very lightly ""sea"" salted. They are fresh tasting. My packages show a Nov 30th, 2012 expiration date. Have not come across a ""non seed"" particulate or stale or off tasting seed yet. Packages are easy to tear open are are resealable....but the problem is, once you start snacking on them you cant stop so resealing a package hasn't happened yet. I was set up for a once every 3 month delivery......but after 2 days, we've gone through 2 packages. I've since changed it to delivery once a month.Total Carbs, 5g, Total Fiber 5g, total sodium 100mg per 1/4 c up serving......so if you're on a low or no carb diet this snack is for you as the fiber cancels out the carbs. It's healthy, no preservatives, no chemicals. Only ingredients are organic shelled pumpkin seeds and Portuguese Sea Salt.Would be a tasty addition to salads rather than sunflower seads.One word of caution.... be careful eating around your computer keyboard....they're small and flat, and easliy fall into the spaces between the keys!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I started taking this product after my doctor recommended it to me. I have never been ""regular"" in the strict sense, and having done some research, I only ovulate a couple times at most per year. I hadn't realized this until the doc taught me what to look for. I have been taking these as recommended for almost three months now, and I have ovulated each month for the last three months, and I'm only really irritable for about three days before I start now rather than two weeks. My cycles are still long, and average of 35 days, but they were twice that long before. I'm still not pregnant, but the first goal has been met in just getting me to ovulate regularly. This has caused a bit of intestinal issue to happen, but barely enough to notice, and that is a common side effect of the chaste tree berry that does a lot of the muscle work in this supplement. I've also noticed better skin from it too. If you are wondering if you should spend the money on this, I recommend it. My charts have become almost the same as the months progress, meaning my body has become more predictable, which is really nice. This does have medical studies done to back it up too...if you won't spend that much on a supplement and are having problems with menstrual issues, I highly recommend you at least get chaste tree berry. Although there are other things in this that work together to help women's bodies prepare for pregnancy as well. I really think it's worth the investment. My thrifty husband even told me to keep taking this instead of scrimping on just chaste tree berry since I showed him proof that this is having an effect on me."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Vitamin D3 is the most bioavailable form of vitamin D, which is well known by both alternative and mainstream medical practitioners to have bone-protective properties. I use this particular brand because the company is highly reputable.There are varying opinions on how much D3 to take. As you can see, this product is 5000 IU. My own alternative healthcare provider has vacillated over the years between recommending a dose of 1000 IU per day, to 2000 IU, to the 5000 IU of this product. I personally take between 1000 - 5000 IU per day depending on the time of year. Regarding a potential danger of overdose of vitamin D, the body itself produces up to 20,000 IU of vitamin D after just 20 minutes of unprotected sun exposure in the summer, with no ill effects. However, for those embarking on a dosage of more than 1000 IU daily, ideally you would do it with a doctor's supervision, having the doctor regularly test your blood levels of vitamin D. Your doctor can test them by ordering a lab to do the 25-hydroxy vitamin D test, abbreviated as ""25(OH)D."" This is touted as the most reliable test of vitamin D status. Optimal levels range between 50 and 70 ng/mLOf course, if you are willing to allow a few minutes of sun exposure in the summer, you can get all the vitamin D you need that way during that time of year. However, in the winter, the angle of the sun is such that if you don't live quite near the equator, the body produces inadequate vitamin D when exposed to the sun--not to mention that very little of the skin is exposed to the sun when it is severely cold outside. Research has discovered that Americans as a whole are dangerously deficient in vitamin D, especially during winter months. The body's ability to produce vitamin D naturally also declines with age.In addition to its well-known benefit of protecting bones, vitamin D encourages the body to produce substances called cathelicidins which destroy viruses, bacteria, and other microbes, which is why vitamin D increases resistance to colds and flu. Research has shown that people who take cod liver oil lower their risk for respiratory infections of all kinds. (Apparently this 19th Century cure-all actually was a viable home remedy.)The risks associated with suboptimal blood levels of vitamin D are many, including"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's, then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex, and since its natural, I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review, I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week, and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes, as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense, some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews, I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic ""lady fix""."

The trick is to get started at the first sign of symptoms, or even sooner if you know you've been exposed by a snotty nosed person.

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"I really like Vita Coco. The product is remarkably good. One of my favorite things with eating or drinking natural foods is when I read the ingredients there is only one. Coconut water is an excellent source of Potassium and if you've ever actually read what the recommended daily amount of potassium is you'll see that it is near impossible to reach on a daily basis. Vita Coco helps get there. I have tried a few other coconut water products, but this one has been my go to option. I like the carton better than a plastic bottle- one of the competitors I tried uses a plastic bottle and I feel that the coconut water gets some of that plastic taste. I have not had a similar problem with Vita Coco."

I was expecting it to be a bit sweet due to the ""honey"" but I was a bit disappointed on that part. Although it suggests to add some milk to make it sweet, I may not have milk readily available at work, so I expect it to be ready to drink I guess. This is actually my first review ever on Amazon, so I guess I really need to point out the bitterness, but it's not bad, just not the best!"

health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"Trigger point performance has made the self massaging industry a little more cooler! I think everyone should do self massage and trigger point release. The quadballer roller is an excellent tool for your lower legs. I have found that it is more aggressive than a foam roller so those that are new to this, the pain might deter you away from regular use. I also noticed that the rounded shape helps to ""dig in"" deeper into the muscle tissue and I really noticed it when I roll my hamstring. (Foam rollers are flat so there isn't as much pressure in the center of the leg). The product line is pretty cool but I don't really think you need the smaller version of this to do anything below the knee -- save your money. Buy this one and do both upper and lower legs. I wouldn't necessarily say that this replaces a foam roller because every tool has different purposes. The small size and portability is a huge plus! Another tip, I use a lacrosse ball for self massage as well. If you are new to this, start off with a tennis ball first, it is not as aggressive.I rated this at 4 stars because of the high price. Their products also vary with instructions depending on what kit you purchase! The bigger the kit, the more information you get. I really didn't appreciate the company basically 'holding out' on their instructional information because you didn't opt to buy their most expensive kit. Since my friend is very experience with trigger point release therapy, he basically taught me everything I needed to know. However, for those who are new to this stuff, there is a good amount of information on the web and youtube. It would be nice if Trigger Point included their DVD with all purchases! Overall, it is a good quality product and besides the aforementioned, I am happy with the product."

However, I've ended up using this pump much more frequently than I imagined, just because I work once a week and and also like to have some milk on hand in the freezer. I would say I pump on average once per day. I've been using this pump now for almost 6 months and it still works great. I like that I can use it with batteries if necessary--a big plus for when I've had to pump on the go. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase even though I sometimes wish I had bought a double."

I wanted another one to leave at work, but the Body Back Buddy is rather large, so I thought I'd give this one a try.

I'm keeping it, since it is smaller and more convenient for work, but if I only wanted one, it would be the Body Back Buddy."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,"Yogi Tea's Pomegranate Green Tea has been my favorite tea for years and years, and when my local grocery store stopped carrying this flavor, I started ordering it from Amazon by the case. It's a good value (cheaper here than at Whole Foods!), but as much as I love this tea, a case of it lasts a long time, and at some point in the months between when I ordered the previous case and my last order, the company sneakily changed the recipe!I thought the flavor was a little off, so I compared the ingredient list on the new box to the list on my last old box, and there was one difference. Both lists included ""pomegranate flavor,"" but the ""powdered pomegranate juice"" from the old box's ingredient list (also here on Amazon's ingredient list) is missing from the new box! (I checked the Yogi Tea website, and their info confirms the change -- there's no more actual pomegranate juice in the tea at all.) I assume real flavoring from a real food became too expensive... So disappointing!I loved this tea because it wasn't super-sweet like all the other pomegranate green teas out there. The tartness of pomegranate showed through the added stevia, and there was just a tiny touch of peppermint tossed in to make the flavor really bright -- it was refreshing iced! The new formula/recipe is sweeter and flatter in flavor and the tartness is more... harsh. Perhaps other people will still love it, but if you're here like me looking for your old favorite, consider yourself warned!!"

(I had tried some prescription versions and they usually made me feel sick, so I stuck with the Rainbow Light.) However, she recommended adding a DHA supplement to the vitamin. These DHA supplements are easy to swallow and don't leave an odd aftertaste like some vitamins do."

I had tried the boil and bite for a few wks, but it was very uncomfortable and actually starting hurting my gums so I stopped wearing it. Then my dentist insisted that I had to wear a night guard (I've cracked two teeth) and so I tried this one and it has worked very well for me. It has held up well. is comfortable enough for me and still allows me some ability to speak. If the boil and bite has not worked for you, this one is worth a try."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,4.0,"This was my first time taking a diuretic and I was using it to shed water weight prior to a fitness photoshoot. The Xpel did exactly what it promised - wicked water away from my muscles to ensure definition. The only downside to this product was the insane amount of energy I had after the second dose. It was likely the caffeine (and I'm highly sensitive), but some other gals in my photoshoot (who are not caffeine-sensitive) experienced the same thing, too. If I were to make a recommendation for dosage, I would take the first set of capsules around 6-7AM and the second set NO LATER THAN NOON. The first day I took my second set of capsules around 3PM and sat awake all night staring at the ceiling. I also felt that the Xpel works its ""magic"" after the first two days of taking it - a seven day course seems unnecessary. All in all, a great product that I would buy again to shed water weight for photos or special events!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,energy drinks,4.0,"This is definitely a better price than buying red bulls at the gas stations, much better price. I've been off of coffee for a few months now and traded my coffee addiction for red bull, maybe not the best trade but hey I'm no longer drinking coffee so I need to get my energy from somewhere. So, the price is better but I found that drinking one or two of these day starts to add up over time. My friend makes her own energy drinks which I thought was a pretty cool idea, using something called an Energy Stack,Energy Booster Stack - 90 Day Servings!. I'll give credit to her because for the price and amount of time it lasts, it's actually even cheaper than coffee. If you don't mind mixing your own energy drinks, try getting some crystal light mix (if you're looking for the no-calorie thing) and then shaking it up in a water bottle. Tastes pretty good, for the price tastes REALLY good!"

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"I've had only used the glass sprayer form before, which, at first, had seemed more convenient.But these plastic bottles require you to tilt your head back and squeeze the Xlear into the nose. It will flush back into your throat, where you can taste it. I think this is a better approach for me and puts a higher concentration back there than just spraying a little vertically. So far, it's kept my breathing clearer - and sinuses healthier - in this extreme pollen season we're having.Xlear includes Grapefruit Seed Extract, which is ""added as a preservative."" But flushing w/ diluted GSE alone has also been a good treatment for my chronic sinus infections, so it is an added bonus here.To comment on the other reviews:- I can't say I noticed a ""plasticy taste"" yet - at least with the smaller sample bottle of this I used. The sugary taste overwhelms everything else. A taste, BTW, that is - by far - the least unobjectionable of all nasal sprays!- My understanding is that germs don't necessarily ""starve"" on the xylitol sugar. Xylitol just acts as a ""decoy"" or ""key hole jam"" for the receptor mechanism used by bad microbes to attach to sinus tissue. So, in effect, it gives your sinuses a ""teflon coating"" that helps flush out the malignant critters, while allowing more beneficial ""guardian-type"" microbes to stay."

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,arthritic joints and generalized pain reduced using this versus plain hydrulonic acid supplements. Of course (while not really knowing as haven't stopped taking after 3 months yet) this probably is symptomatic; but anything that reduces inflammation tends to let the body try to heal itself. I have been taking the max doze of 2 twice daily with notably reduced pain. However I also take a number of other supplements so it's impossible to isolate which provides more benefit. It would be good to hear from users who limit their intake to a single product for several weeks and report the with or without results. Nothing is actually capable of eliminating the underlying arthritic or even osteoporosis; however it would be valuable to know what is more than symptomatic relief (although that may be all one can get with these underlying conditions).
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"The Synergy diffuser is one of my most important and valued and pleasurable possessions. This diffuser changed our lives. It works beautifully and is unbelievably quiet. It's very easy to use and clean. It is also really graceful and natural and beautiful looking. More importantly, MOST importantly, it cleared our home of black mold and cured my daughter's mold-related health condition.My daughter suffered for one year with a strange health condition. We did not know it at the time, but we figured out later, it was caused by black mold and our new old house was saturated with black mold. My daughter (age 5) had huge amounts of mucus in her system. Sleeping on her back every night allowed mucus to pour down her throat. Almost every night she would wake around 3 or 4 a.m. and vomit about 2 to 4 cups of mucus (we learned to keep a small wastebasket with a plastic grocery bag, with tissues in the bottom, handy, for convenience and comfort while vomiting, and easy cleanup). Thank goodness we're an attachment parenting, family bed family, so we could be there when she needed us. Then she would refuse to lie down again because she didn't want the mucus going down her throat. We'd stack pillows up and she'd lean against these and finally fall asleep. Every morning, she'd wake with a thick layer of mucus dried on the back of her throat. I had this also, for a few weeks. It feels like partially hardened candle wax and the only thing that gets rid of it is eating something like bread, to pull it down.I could write pages about what the mold did to our immune systems, and how I ended up with pneumonia for months without realizing it, and how we had recurring sinus infections, ear infections with burst eardrums, colds that lasted months, etc. But I'll try to keep this short.When we discovered the black mold and figured out what it was doing to our daughter, we moved asap. We left behind our nearly new mattresses (which had mold on the bottom!), and all bedding. The first night in our new house, my daughter slept without vomiting mucus, for the first time in a year. After a month or so, the waxy stuff in her throat stopped.But some of our stuff must have had black mold in it. As I unpacked, it must have spread through the house. Or maybe it was because my daughter found the tightly sealed bags with all her stuffed animals in them and opened them. (I'd been hoping to find a way to rid them of mold). My daughter started vomiting mucus every night, etc.I threw out all stuffed animals (very sad for my daughter) and cushions.By the way, we'd seen several doctors and specialists who were no help. Don't get me started...I spent days in the library and on the internet researching black mold in houses and in humans and what to do about it.I searched a long time for a cold-air diffuser after I read that tea tree oil or thieves blend essential oils can kill black mold in an entire house. When I read about thieves blend it said the diffuser MUST be a cold-air diffuser so the molecular structure of the oils is not altered. If the structure is altered they cannot kill black mold. I could not find a cold-air diffuser anywhere in our (major) city. Save yourself the bother and just order one online.For weeks, I ran the diffuser night and day with an hour break in morning and evening. First with thieves blend and then with tea tree oil. Immediately we felt better.That very first night we ran the diffuser, my daughter did not vomit mucus and she has not done so since. The waxy mucus in her throat every morning stopped after a couple months. She stopped snoring louder than a mack truck every night and now her breathing is clear.Once, the diffuser stopped working. I had left oil in it without running it for a week. Cleaning it per the instructions did not unclog it. Finally I figured out a way. I put rubbing alcohol in it, per instructions. Then, I wet two fingers with alcohol and pressed them over each end of the glass ""body"" of the diffuser (removed from the wooden base). I pulled away one finger, fast, and heard a soft popping noise as the suction was broken. Then I repeated the process, but pulled a finger away from the other end. Then I pressed both fingers on the ends and shook the alcohol inside. This worked but it has caused the air flow to be stronger even on a low setting. I am fine with this, but others might want to 1) NOT leave oil in the diffuser and 2) contact the company for help, instead. This is the only reason I have not given the diffuser 5 stars, though it may be a user flaw and not a product flaw.Now, when I'm not running the diffuser, I remove the body from the wooden base and store it in a drawer, tilted so air can flow freely through both ends. If there is extra oil in it, I just pour it down a vent, or into a jar of tea tree oil I use for cleaning purposes. I never have a clogging problem now.I love the box the diffuser came in. It's great for storing pipettes, doesn't take up much room, is not ugly plastic, etc."

Does not sick or, does not feel emollient. It is not irritating, I do not get red or burn from it, so that is good. I use it as a body lotion, but at $28 for 2 ounces, it is not worth it.

I had already been taking plain acidophilus tablets and lactase enzyme for my lactose intolerance and neither did as much combined as these have done. I would definitely recommend these and they are the only product like this that I know of that doesn't need to be kept in the refrigerator and taken strictly on an empty stomach which is a huge convenience.

The best thing is the excellent strawberry flavor. I highly recommend it.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"6/28/2012Tapioca pudding is delicious, but the prepared pudding in the stores is expensive and contains many calories. So I thought it would be easy and economical to make at home. (I didn't realize how little tapioca you put in each batch, and bought three more of these boxes than I will ever use.)Predictably Bob's Red Mill recipe is excellent, but I don't want the sugar or the salt. I have made several variations so I'll jump to my latest recipe.I make a double batch using one cup of pearls and six cups of non-fat milk, no water. Instead of using sugar, I put ten packets of Costco's sucralose sweetener in the main pudding, and four packets in the egg whites (using four eggs with the doubled recipe) before whipping.The main change I made with the latest batch is to put the cup of dry pearls into a coffee grinder, divided in two batches to fit into the grinder (the Krups coffee grinder from Amazon which is great). I found that despite soaking the pearls even overnight that they were still too firm. After grinding the pearls, I soak them with the sweetener and all the milk overnight.Otherwise, I follow Red Mill's recipe as to the heating and cooling times, and adding the vanilla (one teaspoon)."

health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I was on my feet a lot in my late 20s, and wound up with tendonitis in both heels at the same time. Thank goodness it wasn't spurs, but still, it hurt. With every step, it felt like someone was driving a railroad spike into my heels. After a lot of physiotherapy and a couple of cortisone shots, my doctor gave me a pair of Tuli's cups and told me to wear them in my shoes at all times.I thought she was nuts. They just don't look like much, and they are not cushiony. But I did it anyway. She wasn't nuts, she was right. Tuli's cups really do absorb the shock from the heel strike. Like many people, I tend to carry my weight slightly behind my center of gravity. This means my heels strike extra hard.I wore my Tuli's for years, and was thrilled that there was such a simple solution for heel pain. Then, suddenly, I couldn't find them anywhere. It was before Amazon sold merchandise other than books. I started buyingSpencos,and they're very helpful too. I figured I'd have to use the Spencos forever and would never find Tuli's again.Last autumn, my heels started acting up again, though. So I got myself some new Tuli's and put them in one pair of shoes (I rotate three pair). I removed the Spencos from that pair and reinserted the original insole and added the Tuli's cups. Ta da! Problem fixed. In a few days, the pain was gone again. Don't get me wrong, I do like my Spencos, but some of the varieties are awful.That grid on the bottom of the Tuli's cups absorbs a whole lot of shock. It does take a bit to get used to them. At first, I was ever conscious of them, but after awhile, they feel perfectly normal. You can wash them, and put them in different shoes if you want. You don't have to remove the shoe's insole like you do with Spencos.I'm wearing them now, and if your feet hurt, you should too!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I've tried a few other Nitric Oxide supps, and comparing this one to them, NO-Xplode is much better. I've been trying to put some serious muscle mass in the gym and heard that by getting a more bloodflow to the muscle while lifting ultimately leads to more strength. My supplement regigme consists of NO Xplode which I take before every workout, whey protein (same brand) which I take two times a day but a serving in a half so really three servings a day total, and that stack that promotes higher testosterone levels called theNatural Testosterone Booster Stack (Bulk Powder) 90 Days Supply, which if you look at the ingredients, its basically the closest your getting to an anabolic steroid.I have been on this regiment going on 6 weeks, usually change things up every 8-10 weeks, and have seen about a 15 percent increase in my main lifts (i.e. bench was 225 for 15 reps, now is 245 for 14 reps, barbell curls went up 10 pounds on each side, and so on). For building pure raw strength I have never taken a better combo.

I simply wanted a product which supports me in reaching my goal of adding mass and in this regard ""True Mass"" absolutely failed.If ""True Mass"" would be any other kind of ""non-consumable"" product I'd send it back right away, as it did not bring along the results it promised. Unfortunately the nice red 5.75 Pound thingy is all empty now and I feel like I got screwed over by all those reviews making love with BSN.Don't buy it just cuz it looks pretty and tastes like Ice-Cream."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have gluten intolerance and require a high calorie, high protein diet. Unfortunately, also being hypoglycemic means not having a huge appetite, so I must pack large amounts of calories into small amounts. Like most celiacs, I also have some level of lactose intolerance and soy sensitivity. Toss in al allergy to eggs and my choices become quite limited.Like many people, I can only tolerate so much Creatine. So, finding a protein supplement which contains no egg, no soy, no wheat and no Creatine is a challenge. If you do find it, it usually costs a fortune. This product fits that description and at a very reasonable price! I signed on for a subscription to order 10 lbs of this a month!To add to it, the flavor is considerably better than the stuff I was using previously! This stuff actually tastes good! The only thing I do wish is that all flavors came at the same price. The strawberry and chocolate flavors cost a lot more than the vanilla. That should get boring rather quickly, though I can add some flavoring to the vanilla. Note that you can add milk to increase the caloric value but it is not necessary for flavor at all.This part has been added later. While the vanilla flavor was good for protein drinks, I just got the strawberry flavor today. It's even better than the vanilla! Have not finished the vanilla. It is kind of hard to drink at times. Very rich and has that whey protein smell. Strawberry seems much easier to take and lacks the odor. BTW, the price on strawberry dropped since I ordered the vanilla. Here's hoping the chocolate will follow that trend."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I purchase this product for my son who has eczema its light and has a nice smell so far is working fine put it on him twice a day in the morning and at night.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,My friend recommended I get this for my back since he loves his. I am SO happy I bought it. I actually find I use it on my feet more often than my back. For the first time I can actually reach all the sores spots on my back and feet and apply just the right amount of pressure. Buy it you won't be sorry.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"This was the 2nd weight gainer I tried after first trying one of the cheaper ""high calorie"" weight gainers, which turned out to be a big mistake, and I love this stuff. You get the protein and carbs quickly without the extra sugar and fat found in other supplements.Instead of using the recommended 4 scoops I take 3 scoops with milk which mixes much better and using milk instead of water compensates for the fact that I'm using fewer scoops so still get plenty of protein with every shake.I've been taking it for a few months and went from a skinny 140 to 160 so really pleased with the results. My favorite is Chocolate Mint but I've also tried the Cookies 'N Cream flavor which I didn't like as much."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"The jars arrived sticky, which means that sealing did not work properly.It is also nice to do some reading from the tag that came with the product:""Along with international recognition, our products have also been awarded many prizes due to the above merits. Our first prize - Hors Concurs, (international Trade Exhibition, London was awarded in 1932""Hello! That was 80 years ago! No new award since then - ha, ha! I can see why! Besides, it is like saying ""I am pretty; I was Miss Kentucky 80 years ago""... Right!As for the ""thyme flavor"", you may try garlic instead. An attentive reader will say"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,excellent product.myself and wife both got excellent sleep after taking this product.it seems to be combination of vitamin mineral and herb.ordering one more.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"This is a fantastic price for a quality product. I have used other nutritional yeasts but like the texture, aroma, flavor, and color of this one. Shipping was prompt and arrived in perfect condition. I plan to sign up for ergular deliveries."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Really like this protein powder because it not only tastes great, but it doesn't contain added sugars or preservatives. Mixes easily and well and is filling, just wish the Jay Robb products weren't so expensive. It's best to order in bulk to save a little if you use on a regular basis."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"some brands of this combination are - well, yukky! but this is a pleasant tasting, easy to get down product that I use for steroid-caused osteoporosis. Glad it is available through the mail as it is too difficult these days to get to health food store."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,I bought two of these per other reviewers saying one wasn't enough when you are pumping often. Only thing I wish is that they were easier to clean.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Using Dr. Oz's recommendation for appetite suppressants; Glucomannan, Apple Pectin, Grape Seed, and Forskolin. And just added CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid). My appetite has decreased and I've lost 10 pounds in a little less than 30 days, with minimal exercise--that will change in the next month. Feel a little better too.Much less expensive than one of those diet pills that combines all or most of these ingredients.Also, Dr. Oz recommends a multivitamin, magnesium, and fish oil daily, for all of us. Cut the multi vitamin in half and take in the morning and then in the evening; take the magnesium two hours before any other vitamin; keep the fish oil gels in the frig.Quick delivery, good service, good product!!!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,3.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my hubby, who is a hot sauce fanatic! The item description said that there would be a gift of some sort with the purchase, but it never came. Seller informed me that it was an outdated description and apologized. My husband likes most of the sauces he is sent (one per month), but it's definitely not worth the price, in both of our opinions (one sauce tasted like spicy ketchup)."
health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"Several years ago, full length Spenco's were recommended to me by my chiropractor. They specifically recommended the full length and NOT the three-quarter length because the plastic support in the full length was moderate and very comfortable, while the three-quarter was very high and obtrusive.Because Academy Sports stopped carrying the full lengths, I came to Amazon and didn't have a chance to look at them first.Now, They've changed them. Spenco is using the same big, obtrusive plastic support in the full length as they do in the three quarter.It is like a HUGE wad of something in my shoe. Even though they're the right size, the arch support is too far back to the heel, and feels like a big old lump that's not even in the right place, i.e. under the arch. And my shoe doesn't fit right. Even side to side across the arch, this new version doesn't fit in the shoe. Btw, I temporarily took out the older Spenco from one and wore one of each. The new one just feels wrong.They're going back."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"Bough this product after our last one broke after 18 months. Not unhappy with that life span considering it was our travel sound machine, and we do a lot of traveling with our little one, and it lived most of its life in a tightly packed, heavily abused diaper bag. I hope to see a similar life from this one.I like this one better as it does batteries and also an AC adapter, but it does have a considerably lower sound quality than our last one, which was similarly priced and smaller.In reality, my daughter still loves it, and sleeps through the night, so I can't really knock it for that. But if you are an audiophile, that will probably frustrate you.Very happy with our purchase."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have used this with table massage and with chair massage and in both cases the client enjoys the feel and the additional depth that I am able to go with this. It also saves on my thumbs.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"After a thorough research on the infinite types of protein bars out there, I decided to give this brand a chance. Despite its excellent nutritional value, this flavor didn't rank well with Amazon consumers. With some reservations, I took a chance and ordered these. Let me say, I am glad I did! Perhaps I got lucky with my batch, but they were not rancid or dry like some reviewers complained. These were not only fresh, but moist and tasted like brownies with a bit of crunch. Hoping I'll be 'lucky' again, I will be placing my second order today."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"... and I've tried many. Great cool mint flavor and crispy center. Compare the fat and sugar to other bars and this one beats most. One thing I've noticed is new packaging. The term ""the all-natural protein bar"" is missing. Hmmmm. Why? I haven't compared the ingredients to an older bar. Is it now NOT all natural? In any event, it's a killer protein bar. But beware... it gets very messy and melty in hot weather. Especially if UPS leaves it on your doorstep in the summer. Once it cools, the chocolate will harden again, but it turns into a super-flaky mess (but still tasty)."
health personal care,health care,diabetes,5.0,This was perfect for keeping our insulin pens cool while on a flight to Los Angeles to board a ship to Hawaii. I was able to prepare the bag the night before and pack it. The items were still cool when we finally received our bags aboard our ship. Almost 20 hours later. Security at the airports never questioned it. Great Item!
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,1.0,these nipples easily invert while feeding which was annoying. switched to avent nipples which are harder and cannot be inverted.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Very hot stuff... In my opinion the S rating should be much higher. I've had a lot of hot stuff including Daves, etc etc. It's worth a try if you like hot hot stuff. I tried a toothpick tip and was sweating and salivating and I eat habos pretty often that's why it stunned me b/c this stuff is made with habo's. It is just very concentrated. Have fun hot eaters, keep away from kids/pets too."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"I have type 2 diabetes, and of course the Dr. says lose weight, about 20 pounds. I had read ads in magazines about Almased being recommended for diabetics, so I thought I would try it. I put it in light Almond milk, used a blender and put in a couple of ice cubes, I think it tastes like a malt, you can also add a little cinnamon extract and it's even better!! It has the amino acids that most protien shakes don't have. The difficult part was the first 3 days when it recommends having nothing but the shakes 3 times a day and some broth. I have only lost a couple of pounds, but I have never been a breakfast eater and I can drink a shake with no problem. I feel that the 25 grams of soy protien is really healthy. I am going to continue using it for the health benefits."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"These are great. They smell fishy, but it seems that Krill is better than fish oil. The price is better than most others, and I understand that Jarrow's vitamins (the way they are processed) are a very good product."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,juices,4.0,"Excellent quality & fresh. Not cut with other juices, just the Goji juice! I love the taste and feel it boosts my immune system."
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"I eat this for breakfast 3-6 days a week. Like ""GrapeNuts"", this cereal stays crunchy for a long time in liquid. Unlike the fore mentioned cereal, it's rice only and it can be crushed for use in crumb crusts or as a substitute for breadcrumbs. I love it."
health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,"With my dust and cat allergies, I will sneeze dozens of times in a row. Veramyst helps (but is expensive). Nothing helped after sneezing to clear my sinuses. It took a chance glimpse of an Oprah Show to discover Neti-pots. I purchased my first Neti-Pot with packets of saline crystals from Nasaline Salt Packets - Mixing Saline Solution, 50 pkt., (Nasaline) and it was amazing how fast and clean it worked. The sneezing stopped! I am talking about being in my early fifties and dealing with this problem my entire life!So when the packets ran out, I bought more Nasaline packets and then NeilMed's Sinus Rinse Pre-Mixed Packets, 100-Count Boxes (Pack of 2). Check out SinuAir Powdered Saline Convenient Packets. After some searching (Target does not always have them, nor do other similar stores), I found SinuCleans to have the best deal on packets. You cannot beat this 100-packet deal for the price. Almost all of the saline packet crystals are the same ingredients. DO NOT, as I tried, using plain bottled water without the saline crystals or plain table salt. You will burn the heck out of your sinuses. You have to use the saline crystals. Here is a great deal.UPDATE"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"We used to purchase this product locally. It is a must have in the health regimen.We ran out and our local health food store was out as well. After 2 weeks waitingfor them to get more in, we looked online.Found through Amazon at less than our local store.This is a WINNER."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Told my girlfriend with terrible fibroids about Myomin -- her doctor was going to do surgery --she told the doc she wanted to try Muomin first-- and did for Two months -- in a updated CT scan her fibroids shrunk and some were GONE -so no surgery for her --- I know I feel better overall when I take it !!!!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,My husband has fibromyalgia and uses this ointment on his back before he goes to bed. It helps to relieve his pain so that he can sleep. It is the best pain relieving cream or ointment that we have found.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"I wasn't sure about this item until I saw that it incorporates infrared heat. Still skeptical, I was relieved to see that the marketing copy in the product description twice mentions infrared heat. I am no expert in electromagnetism or thermodynamics but I do know that infrared heat is the best kind of heat. Ultraviolet heat (for example) is just lousy, lousy heat, IMHO."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"As my title states this product is probably fine-I like NOW brand products. Here is my problem-and Amazon should have rules on this-yes you get 60 capsules....but it is only 20 ""servings""...I was taking 20 mg of Lutein and some Bilberry before this-to get the 20 mg of Lutein I would need to take 6 of these...that's 10 days servings of this bottle....Amazon should be required/require sellers to post a copy of the label, because as you start comparing brands and quantities on here, you go for what you feel is a good value and end up regretting it and honestly thinking that getting vit's and supplements from other online retailers may be a better, easier option."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This purchase was everything I hoped it would be. The coconut oil is excellent. I will certainly use the Vitamin Shoppe again when I need product.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,These shields are a great deal. Cheaper than Target and Walmart when I ordered. I was using the 24 mm because that is what came with my pump and come to find out that was the reason I wasn't getting much milk. These work great!
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"Well, I don't know what a good espresso coffee is supposed to taste like. I can tell you that I bought a new espresso machine, and have been making cappuccinos with this coffee for a few days now, and I just LOVE it. Yum, yum, yum, and decaf too. So, it may be good or not, but it's good for me!Update. Well, I ordered another bag of Lavazzo, but it seems to be taking a while to ship - so I went to Wegmans and got a bag of their decaf espresso coffee beans thinking, well, it's espresso coffee, right? Wrong. So, now I want my Lavazza and I want it now. The Wegmans coffee is truly awful, bitter, burnt etc. and does not have much of the ""crema."" So, I can truly say the Lavazza makes a wonderfully flavorfull cup of coffee."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,We were looking for something for my granddaughter to use at the table and this is perfect. She sits with us and it takes up less spacke that a regular high chair. Quality is good; matches and is sturdy.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"The whey protein by Optimum Nutrition works great for me as I have compared it to other whey protein shakes that I have purchased before. I seem to have adequate energy for work outs and recover fairly well when drinking this ON shake. It may not be for everyone especially if you prefer more tastier variations, but I can attest that this product is of fine quality and you surely will not regret purchasing it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Wife and I have a 3 1/2 year old. We've tried for a second child for 2 years. Nothing happened. We finally got to the point of looking up in vitro clinics. She saw this online and bought it for me. I took it for about 3 months. Then she bought the female pills and after about a month she got pregnant. She tried other ways to get pregnant as well. Acupuncture and Chinese herb doctor. This stuff worked for us and I believe it helped us. Don't lose hope. I started to and voila.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody. Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body. You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell. I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in. The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping. As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant. Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market. The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is by far the best product on the market. No more laxatives, softeners, chunky or thick junk to help you along...this is the magic bullet. This stuff is pleasant tasting and more like drinking Tang or orange kool aid than some kind of fiber or laxative. It's safe for using when you're pregnant and nursing and it does the trick. I wish I'd have known about it sooner. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a little help keeping their body on track...just had a baby, surgery, and I'm nursing and I wouldn't change products or try anything else even if it was free."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I was very skeptical ordering yet another sugar subsitute that ""tastes"" like sugar but isn't. I was SO pleasantly surprised when I used my xylitol for the first time this morning!! It tastes just like regular sugar! It does not have that fake sugar substitute taste like Splenda and even Stevia. It's amazing that I can enjoy my coffee without the after taste that sugar substitutes leave.I highly recommend this product to anyone who cannot use regulard sugar, but hates the sugar substitute after taste!"
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,2.0,"First, this product only comes in a bland white. I would think they could do better than just white. I think it would look nice in a blue, or red or green. But no. But this decor piece is nice for a modern look.So I decided to put it on a coffee table, but after about a week it began to really stink, and i got really angry, but then I realized that perhaps it was an outdoor piece. So I set it outside next to some chairs, and it had a nice effect. I called some friends over so we could talk outside(But really so I could show off this product. I got some compliments, but woman commented that the piece was far too gaudy and risky for someone like me. but I kept it anyway. This decoration is okay overall, but the designers need some more creativity."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"What a treat to get this in the mail this afternoon! I had to hold back from having more than a heaping tablespoon. This is some yummy honey, oh wow! Thick, velvety consistancy with a smooth, not overly sweet taste. Cannot wait to add to tea and spoon over warm bread. Very pleased- much better than the other brand I tried."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been using the Solgar Honey Nut Whey to Go Protein supplement in the Honey Nut flavor for several years, and when I run out, I always look for the same flavor. I have tried other flavors, and they are adequate, but for making things such as smoothies, you can't beat Honey Nut."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I think the banana flavor was overwhelming for me because I normally have issues with drinking protein anyway, so combined I was not impressed. I think had I gone with vanilla it would not have been quite as bad for me. The protein in it was GREAT for what I needed it for and could tell it was working, but the taste was dreadful. I would only recommend to those with strong stomachs or who are VERY used to drinking protein. Note of caution"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I was skeptical but this tea really does work. The taste is ok, nothing amazing. I used it in the first few weeks postpartum and then on and off if something like poor diet or stress or illness has reduced my output a bit."
baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,5.0,"We've only had this 24 hours, but so far it seems great. Some reviewers mentioned getting sent the wrong color or model, but ours was exactly as advertised. Our baby is a little young for it (5 months) so he sometimes flops to the side a little and needs a receiving blanket tucked in there, but he seems to love being in the chair. He loves sitting up instead of leaning back like the baby chairs do, and he always wants to be up at our eye level. This lets him do both. I'm also very satisfied with the construction - everything works intuitively and there are no crevices to collect icky stuff like most highchairs. Also, the tray is low enough to push the chair in at the table when we're not using it. For such a great price, we're more than satisfied."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,4.0,"Its the only salt I eat . I bought it to drink(in water) as I had read it would help clear up lungs. I've used it 4 months and lungs are not any better. But, I have grown to like the taste of Celtic salt better than regular table salt."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Fantastic product. I have been lifting for 30 years, using various powders, but this is one of the only ones that mixes with only a spoon and glass, and tastes awesome. Even better, it is well researched and produced and doesnt include things you dont need like ephedra, glandulars, etc."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,"I am happy with this lavender spray. Has a natural lavender smell that is pleasant and relaxing. Have been using the spray on the bed and pillows and sleeping wonderfully! Scent does not last as long as I had hoped but I will purchase again. Also, my kids love it and ask me to spray their rooms. I recommend this lavender spray."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"I bought two sets, and I'm very pleased with the construction of the containers. The compartment lids snap shut with enough force to not pop open on their own, but not so difficult it can't be open one handed. I like the fact they're square, so it's easy to rotate them such that the day label isn't visible when a day's through (for those of us who don't know what day of the week it is until the second or third cup of coffee). All in all, of all the pill organizers I've ever handled, this is one of the best."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,No Doubt this item is THE BEST for beginner or Intense workout.I have suggested this to my friends and they went crazy with the performance of this Whey. Quality and Taste surpasses any other protein supplement available in market.And result is simply WOW.Use it and have fun!!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have had different types of digestion issues since a child. Recently I was introduced to the idea of probiotics. I chose this brand specifically because of all the great reviews. I have been using this product for about a month and have noticed great improvements. Lets put it this way, my new nickname should be smooth operator! I give this only 4 stars not because of the quality but for the price. A month ago it was $20 a bottle now its almost $85! Really how is that even possible?! Now I'm forced to look for another brand that is just as good for a more reasonable price...."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Very good tasting, I have now bought several boxes from Promax and they are the best tasting real protien bar I have found. Not the absolute most strict for a diet but that is a personal preference. The taste is far better then guys like flurry or Met-Rx"
baby products,feeding,unknown,5.0,Every Woman must have these!!!I used to purchase the sticky tape ones which left a nice rash around my nip area...these are so much better!!! just peel and it stays in place no tape needed for these! and they can be washed in mild soap and water and reused.. Works great when wearingT-shirts. I am 48 yrs young and I wish I would have purchased these years ago! cannot be without them!
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,3.0,"We get these all the time and my husband really likes them, however, this last package has been void of strawberries...Was something wrong with a batch that didn't get caught at the factory??"
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,packaged meals side dishes,2.0,"Let me just say that I had a choice between this meal and saltines and I chose the saltines. At least they don't have that overpowering sweet soy sauce taste. It was an empty meal. The cover gives a false impression of a more hardy, diverse product than that which I discovered when I opened the bland noodle package. It tasted like I was doing myself harm in the consumption of the noodle bowl; like I was dangerously close to my maximum dosage of sodium and sugar. It is cheap and its GREAT that the bowl is biodegradable. But please, make it taste like food and charge more. If I wanted to eat sweetened flour for a low price then I'd eat fast food. I'd rather pay a bit more for a good product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"This is the finest protein powder I've found so far.1st, it's mostly protein. 25g in 28g serving = 89% protein. VERY GOOD. If it's not protein in the other brands, what is it? A lot of crap. Really the extra junk in most powders should be given A LOT of consideration if you consume large amounts of protein like many of us do.2nd, the total fat, sat fat, sugar and cholesterol are VERY LOW.3rd, no artificial sweetener.4th, great price.5th, good company.6th, tastes good for a plain protein.This is an excellent product, go for it."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I took these while pregnant and am still taking them while nursing. They are bigger because the vitamins are taken from food versus created in a lab. The concept behind that is that your body will be able to absorbe the vitamins better. I generally don't like taking vitamins because they make me extra thirsy, and these do too (I think it is the diretic effect of B vitamins). But they are the best vitamins I have found for myself. I have taken the non-prenatal multivitamins too and I like those as well."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"I cooked the rice on the 'brown' setting on my rice cooker, and it came out perfect. The only thing that I will say is that I think it's quite expensive, so I'll look for it at the supermarket."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I have been using Animal Pak over a year, and on my 4th can. I have nothing but good to say about this product, and I think the ratings here and elsewhere speak for themselves. I understand many people and studies suggest a placebo affect with multis... let me just say this product is one of the ONLY multis that within an hour or two of taking it... MAKES me want work out, gives you that extra jump of energy in its closely analyzed and tested list of ingredients! It also has to be one of the best formulations in a supplement today, I think the antioxidant and performance complex in the ingredients is phenomenal! Be aware, the serving suggestion is 2 packs, the average daily multi man needs only one. If you are still curious what should you do, TRY it for a can, I dont think you will be disappointed!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"i have bad gums that have always been way too sensitive for traditional toothpaste which means i wasn't brushing as often as i should, which in turn was making my gums worse. i read up on tooth powders and thought i would try it... i'm so glad i did! i love this stuff! within just a couple uses, my gums only bleed minimally and the swelling has gone down considerably. plus my breath feels fresher from the ingredients in this tooth powder than from toothpaste. it does stain my toothbrush, but my husband and i are the only one who see it so who cares? i will be buying more of this when it runs out :)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I purchased this product when my baby was weeks old and due to some medication I was taking experienced my milk drying up almost immediately. I was desperate as I wanted to exclusively breastfeed I discovered this product and after just 2 days noticed a significant increase in my milk. After about a week I had do much milk I had to start pumping!! Thank god for this product it is truly effective
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,"The yeast was made in Mexico and did not have any USE BY date on it. After I got it, I realized that I could have purchased 4 pouches for $13.68. I was going to send it back, but the postage was $6.50, so I figured that I might as well keep it and try it. It seems to work well, but I have also ordered the 4 pack."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I have been using Heather's tummy products for about three years, and I feel completely in control of IBS. I mix it with my coffee, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and almost any dinner. A truly tasteless fiber powder!I would have given it a 5 star rating, but it has gone up in price recently, and it is not that i consider this to be an expensive or overpriced item at all, but I had to find a reason to not give it 5 stars."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is my first time using kefir starter and I am very pleased with the product. I'm on my fourth batch from one packet (can do up to seven batches). Really tastes good and is suppose to be better than yogurt.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,If you like tea AND rootbeer this is the product for you. Quite refreshing and easy to mix. A glass of cold water and a touch of this is just what this rootbeer loving girl needs on a hot Georgia day. Or if you are a fan of a certain character who gets whacked on the back of the head. Sassafras. MMMMMMMM.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I have been having trouble with staying alkalined, even though my diet and habits were good, I have been taking these tablets for a month now and I am staying alkalined. They really work. I am deligted to find something in supplement form that keeps me in an akaline state."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,4.0,"I love Bob's Red Mill organic whole grain Buckwheat Groats but this morning I found a small rock in my cooked buckwheat groats, it was tiny like a groat. This is worrisome as I could have cracked a tooth, so when you chew this, chew carefully. It was package number 3997800580. I've never had this happen before and I've ordered this through Amazon a few times."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"None of the stores around here carry unflavored protein, they're all loaded up with either sugar or some type of poisonous excitotoxin sweetener.This stuff rocks, you can mix it with just about anything like fruit juice or milk to make it more filling and nutritious.It dissolves easily and tastes good even without any sweetening. Highly recommended 5/5."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,4.0,"These are just too potent for me to take all at once. So what I do is alternate taking the four largest pills one day and the rest the next day. For me this gives me a nice over all sense of well being. The secret to swallowing these pills is first get a huge glass of water. Next stand up straight, maintain good posture. Put pills in mouth. Toss them around in your mouth to moisten them so they don't hurt your throat. Chug the water, tip your head back slightly, don't overthink it and the pills should go right down. Most of all don't panic. If you think it's too much to take more than one at a time then take them one at a time. The reason I gave these 4 stars is because I can't see myself taking these regularly for the rest of my life."
health personal care,health care,allergy,4.0,Products did not come boxed as advertised. I question the products sanitary process. I have never purchased this product loose without packaging.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love this tea so much! It tastes great, gives me just the right of energy I need without wanting to dance on table tops or talk a mile a minute and it curbs my appetite so I'm not tempted to snack during the middle of the day! I like it so much that I bulk up and buy more than one box at a time because its hard to find Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life at my local store.Everyone reacts to things differently, but if you're looking for energy and a way to keep hunger at bay, you may like this tea a lot! I also noticed (and it could be a coincidence) that the times I've started getting a cold and been drinking this, the germs don't stand a chance!:)"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Bought the 1st one for my mom not long ago and she's been taking it for almost half month now, she has HBP for so many years now it drops to normal, it's amazing it really worked. I just bought 8 more for all my family. If you have high blood pressure then you should give a try.now I'm just hoping the price won't go up to normal!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"I started taking the liquid twice daily since August 2011. As of this writing, I still do not see any noticeable results. I had strong nails to begin with, so I did not expect much change there. I just do not see any difference in my hair, and I am only taking into account the few inches that would have grown in the nine months I have been taking it. I will finish off the bottle I have at this time, but I don't think I will order again. I am past menopause, so maybe that may be part of the results."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,Used this after a 2.7 mile hike up the pacific crest trail in Washington. Definitely helped fuel the pace downhill in snowshoes. Has an excellent chocolate candy taste. You must immediately follow it with a bit of water.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Decided to go with the larger size after buying smaller size bottle. This product, when combined with Bromelain & Quercetin from same mfg., seems to help minimize muscle soreness and athiritic knee pain(both forms of inflammation),but not eliminate it entirely. Have stopped taking daily 81 mg aspirin because this helps soreness better and I believe it's a little safer than NSAIDS. I began about two to three months ago, so someone taking just one or the other may have less or different results, while some people take larger doses or stronger tablets of serrapeptase may rave about results. I prefer the conservative approach! The daily dose (on an empty stomach) for me has been 2-3 of each two times daily(morning and before bed). I also take a different brand of astaxanthin( Bio-astin),one tablet a day for several months, and found that it gives my aerobic capacity a subtle boost(easier to breathe when exercising hard)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I was looking for tea to get me off of my highly caffeinated ones. I saw this on sale at a decent price at my local grocery and decided to give it a whirl it was so cheap. I really liked it. I don't have any liver problems but I'm sure my liver could use a good cleaning. My health conscious friend kept telling me I need to eat foods or do a cleanse that releases the bile of the liver so I don't get a liver stone build-up. I told him I was drinking this tea and he said it's a start. I did the subscribe 'n' save to save a little on the bulk teas. Also the directions on the box say to use it for 4 - 6 weeks and you can't do that drinking it 3 times a day with just one box. Amazon has a good deal here.
health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,this is a great product to have in the house in case of breaks in the skin from gardening or housework it is very effective at killling germs and promoting healing
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,This product was fantastic . Took a test daily & I watched as my line became darker . I bought these more for comparison with the Wondolfo brand ( which also work great ) . But with the help of both brands I'm pregnant within my first month of trying .
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I originally bought this product when my daughter was struggling with IBS-C as a teenager, after reading about it on the ""Help for IBS"" website. Not only was it a godsend for her, but also for others in my family who suffer from digestive problems. My elderly, sedentary mother has experienced tremendous relief from a problem with slow motility, and my cousin has achieved complete remission from diverticulosis, narrowly avoiding the surgery recommended by his doctor (he thanks me every time he sees me). I have no idea why the medical profession hasn't figured this out yet - they recommend ""fiber"" for constipation, but don't understand that *soluble* fiber is the key to bowel regulation in both constipation and diarrhea. We refer to it as our ""magic powder,"" which I know sounds silly but the relief this has given my family is deadly serious. Note"
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"I suffer from chronic pain, and stumbled on to this product a few years ago. I've ordered both the Orange and Peppermint flavor Gaba Calm Sublingual tablets and they both deliver.Instead of taking some prescribed anti-inflammatory/pain killing/anti-depressant, try Source Naturals GABA Calm."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Very good tasting tea, hardly need sugar it is so smooth. Service was very good, the tea arrived in just a few days."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"The Decaf Pacific Vanilla Chai is a soothing, mostly nondairy, milk-like drink that you can make hot or iced just by adding water. I only drink it hot and like it very much though I wouldn't call it real chai... more like warm milk with sugar and spices in it - lol. The black tea is pretty far down on the list of ingredients so authentic it ain't! Still, I enjoy the warmth of the drink and find it comforting to sip for some reason so I'll continue purchasing. It's especially nice to drink in the evenings on a cold day."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"Just bought this Hemp powder for adding some protein to my diet, but was discouraged upon reading reviews regarding what it's good to mix it with.However, with my being an ""ice cream-aholic"", I decided to try a rounded-teaspoon of this hemp powder stirred into a scoop of Costco's high-fat vanilla ice cream, and it tasted great!So I added another heaping teaspoon to it, and find it easily edible, and am going to have a second serving.Although I was aiming for high protein/low sugar/low salt/low junk additive product.....I was going to eat the ice cream sometime today anyway. So why not ""require"" myself to add this protein to it when I have ice cream....at least until I have a chance to purchase some of the other suggested items to mix this hemp powder with."
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,I work with wood and mechanical stuff a lot so my hands are always getting dirty and dry. Washing them with hand cleaner makes it worse and the dryness causes cracks on my finger tips. I've tried all kinds of products and lotions and nothing really worked except an early Band-Aid product which is no longer made. I have repeatedly tried Skin Shield and it doesn't work for finger dry skin cracks. It might work for other uses but definitely not for this problem. And it stings when you apply it. And it tends to peel off like it is clear paint.If you are looking for a product to seal dry skin cracks then skip Skin Shield as it will not help.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,2.0,I was expecting fresh and flavorful. Instead my shipment was quite tasteless; the candy coating had no flavor at all. I might just as well have bought Brach's at the supermarket for a lot less.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,4.0,Both my son and i have celiac disease and finding bread that was good was challenging. we tried so many and this is the best one we found.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,This product works if inserted about 10 minutes before sex. Open the insert covering down the sides to make it easier to open. It's natural but my boyfriend noticed that it felt a little oilier than astro glide. I like it better.
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,4.0,"Air Therapy has really helped clear the air in several important rooms of my home... if you know what I mean.The citrus scent really knocks down odors. The non-aerosol dispenser is environmentally friendly and the 4.6 fluid ounce bottle just lasts and lasts. The bottle claims up to 2000 sprays... I don't count, but the bottle has lasted a long long time.My only complaint with the product is that the nozzle has become clogged on several occasions. When the nozzle clogs, it's necessary to remove it from the container and run warm water over it to dissolve the gunk.This is a good and effective air-freshener that lasts a long time."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was shocked by how fast the shipping was. Nearly 3 days in advance! Not to mention it was a great price for the quality of this lotion! My skin feels baby soft and even living in a humid state it seems to keep my face from getting oily! Feels so light on my skin all while really hydrating it, even within one use! BUY IT!"
baby products,feeding,food,3.0,"I chose this because I thought it spun, it held 24 jars, and was relatively cheap. It was easy to assemble and it cleared up my shelves nicely, but it doesn't rotate, despite the circular bottom having ""wheels"". It seems like it's supposed to spin, but when I tried to move it by pushing on the middle rack, it only made the middle rack unlock and fall and all of my jars fell down. (Thankfully, none broke!)It's still nice to have them all up off of my shelves, but in hindsight, since it doesn't rotate, I wish I'd have gotten the Prince Lionheart drawer organizer that was $5 instead. http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Universal-Drawer-Organizer/dp/B003I85VAA/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336593127&sr;=8-3-fkmr1"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is a great product! My husband puts some in his cereal every morning, and has had great joint relief since using it."
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,1.0,"These came warped. The lids do not even slightly go on the trays. Overpriced piece of junk. So right out of the box brand new they do not function. Stay away from these, they are a total waste of money."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,I think I have tried all the oral benzocaine products and I consider this to be the second best. The best is benzodent. I still use zylactin a lot for two reasons. 1) Its very fast acting. 2) It doesn't burn like many over liquids and gels. Its short acting so you have to keep the swap in your mouth and it doesn't last as long as benzodent. So when the pain is intense I will use Zilactin first and then apply the benzodent. Zilactin is an excellent product when you want fast acting pain relief that doesn't burn.
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I just used my Medela Harmony breastpump for the first time and was completely satisfied with the product! I also own the Medela In-Style Advanced double electric breastpump which I used while going to school full-time. However, now that I am staying home, I find it to be a big hassle to assemble the electric pump every time I need to express milk. My baby is starting to eat solids, and I just needed a pump for expressing enough milk to mix with baby cereal to feed her. The Medela Harmony was a convenient, effective option for doing this!Having never used a manual pump, I expected it to have a lot less suction power than my electric unit, and therefore, a lot more work. Not so! The suction power is controlled easily by how hard you sqeeze and allows a wide range of suction power. I especially liked that the handle rotates so I can use it from all different angles. Also, the package says that the pump body can be removed from the handle and attached to the Medela Symphony electric pump, which is nice that it's versatile. The pump has many of the same parts at my electric pump, like the yellow insert and the white membrane, so if I lose/break a piece, I now have back-ups, which is why I ultimately chose this product.The unit is simple to assemble/disassemble and easy to clean. I have been thoroughly pleased with this pump and would highly recommend it to other moms!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I use this for so many things its not even funny, here are a few:I use it within an oil concoction for my hair to help with frizziness and it works amazingly well, especially since it helps to lower the ph of many alkaline hair products.On my skin, I use it every night as a sort of face gel after I cleanse to keep it from breaking out and getting too oily. It can be to drying in the winter so I add a few drops, 3-6, of jojoba oil.Occasionally my 3 year old would get small bumps on her face, I apply this at night and by morning she is clear.Whenever I get a cut or scrape I apply the gel and its helps ease the pain quickly even a burn my daughter and I received quite recently from a scalding pot of water.Lastly, I drank this to help better my well being since a good friend of mine with amazing skin mentioned how she would drink this. I never thought to taste it because it looked as if it would not be pleasing but I did and it tastes pretty darn good! I will post later what type of benefits I have received from drinking it but either way I keep a bottle or two in the house!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"Earthy, sour flavor... but not very aromatic. I don't know how indicative this is of Tikuanyin though!I do enjoy it more every time that I have a cup of it though, and it goes very well with light lunch foods."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am so glad I found this. After weeks of severe cystic acne, my face is clearing up after only a few days. I take 4 of these a day and it does the trick. I also combine this with certified organic Argan oil, which also works great. It treats the scars that we're created while I was searching for this!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.The taste of this herbal tea is interesting
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Good to take after a meal to help digestion also useful for nausea and stomach upset. Great quality from Now Foods and I love that its vegetarian.So glad I purchased these!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Received product quickly and in good condition, have only taken it for two days now with no bad side effects or fishy taste. So glad I didn't look in wikpedia at pictures of what it's made of before ordering but if it lowers my cholesterol will keep using it for at least 3 months and report back if it has helped."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I like this protein powder. The 5 pound jug gets you 70 something servings, which is great. The fat, sugar, AND cholesterol are really low, which is important. And it tastes really good! The vanilla is my favorite."
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"They fit perfectly, were shipped in real time, and perform great. Would recommend these versus Dr Shoals at twice the money."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,1.0,"I bought these because I like the Movie Theater Butter flavored microwave popcorn. I've bought the in the store and thought this was a great deal.But these have a serious problem. The bags say to cook for no longer than 2.5 minutes (that's 2 minutes, 30 seconds) and to stop if, before that, the popping slows down to a pop ever 2 seconds.I cooked about 10 of the bags and half of them burned through before reaching the limit, all while not slowing down the popping. One bag burned right through at about the one minute mark, with about 30 kernels popped. Butter-goo was all over the microwave. What a mess!I'm going to throw out the rest, because I'm terrified one will actually burst into flames."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,pasta noodles,5.0,"I have this on my ""subscribe and save"" list because it is, hands-down, my favorite pasta ever! I try to eat healthy but it just doesn't work unless it tastes good. and this stuff tastes fabulous. I'm old enough to remember trying the ""new"" whole wheat pasta and lordy, was it bad! All brands have certainly gotten better at it, but this is tasty, healthy, even has flax seed in it! The spirals hold up well to boiling and holds a sauce well. I'd give it 17 stars if they were available."

health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"Having suffered from acid reflux for years, I had basically given up on Tums, Gaviscon, Omeprezole and other over the counter and prescription drugs. Even when changing my eating habits, they just didn't work for the long-term. Out of desperation I went to my local health food store and was told to try a regimen of Apple Cider Vinegar, Honey and water twice a day and to use Reflux-Away when an acid reflux attack would occur due eating too much or eating the wrong foods. I am very glad to say that their advise really works. The Apple Cider Vinegar/Honey drink is a good maintenance regimen and Reflux -Away works when an attack occurs. Yes, there is a slight after taste and some burping that can occur but it is a small price to pay for the relief that it brings. The more I read about the long-term acid suppressor drugs like Omeprezole, the more concerned I became and am glad that I found and alternate regimen that really works"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My son (10 years old) had been suffering from severe constipation for several years. We went from doctor to doctor and despite making changes to his diet and trying several medicines, he continued to suffer from it. Triphala has been a blessing and since he has started it, his problem has gone away. He has been taking it for a few months now, and an Ayurvedic doctor advised us that it can be taken for any period of time with no side effects. I am writing this so that if you have a child who suffers from constipation, you can give this miraculous mixture of herbs to help relieve the problem. Unlike medicines for constipation, Triphala improves appetite and general health and has no harmful side-effects. One teaspoon of Triphala in a cup of water (with, optionally, a teaspoon of honey added to it) taken at night half an hour after dinner helps in regularity."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,5.0,"While this product most likely won't shred the fat for you, in conjunction with regular PT and a good diet, the fat will really fall off.I started taking this about 2.5 or 3 weeks ago,started having six small healthy meals a day from when I woke up then every three hours,and I PT'd every Tuesday,Thursday, and Saturday(mainly cardio).At the start, I was 236lbs. Now I'm sitting right at 221lbs. Pros being said,there was only one con and that was on the first day. After about an hour of taking the first capsule, my skin felt like it was on fire. Being a thermogenic though, its sort of expected. No worries though, the sensation faded away after a couple of hours and I haven't had any recurrences of that. All in all, I would say that the positives to this product outweigh the negatives. But remember, if you want this to really work;-PT 3 times a week,but not back to back. Walk run or jog 1.5 mile.-6 small healthy meals a day,this boosts your metabolism and helps burn fat. NEVER skip breakfast,this kick starts your metabolism.Well that's it for my review/story, best of luck in your endeavors!"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,Ordered these bottles and am very happy with my purchase. They ar BPA Free and today that is a biggie. Will definately buy again.
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,5.0,"Being on a low carb/low glycemic diet, I shop around for low carb bars as meal replacement or snack option. I saw these bars at Kaiser Permanente (my HMO) and purchased them. 1) they are cheaper than other low-carb/no-carb bars out there, 2) they are actually quite tasty for being low-carb. I think a lot of people who are not used to low-carb protein bars do not have the experience with these types of bars, so they make comparison to regular bars out there that have upwards of 25 grams of sugar per serving. Of course sugar makes everything taste good, but that's definitely not my goal nor the goal of other low-carb eaters out there. We're looking for bars that don't have the same amount of sugar as a candy-bar (like Snickers), which a lot of other nutrition bars out there have. I give a five star rating, because compared to other low-carb bars, this is top notch."
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,1.0,"I use to love this product, however this version of the Bucky 40 blinks eye mask is not made to last. With in a month the lining that rest on the face peels away. I thought I may have gotten a defective mask yet me second mask also peeled away with in a month. The eye mask it's self is to narrow and lets light in. The elastic strap is very uncomfortable and leaves tender spots on my head. Very disappointing. Wish they would go back to the older version."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,coconut water,5.0,"We have tried many different brands of Coconut Water, and we have found that Vita Coco consistently tastes the best and the freshest. My little toddler enjoys it most of all. Very refreshing, and it helps replaces lost electrolytes."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,"I have ordered this product several times(only twice from this particular seller) and the wiring next to the actual egg becomes unraveled quickly. If you are unfortunate enough to touch the exposed wiring you get quite a bit of a shock (it is ten times worse if you have wet hands). I expressed this to the company and was literally laughed at. While I pride myself on being a filthy zen hippie with a relaxed disposition and awesome sense of humor, I don't think being electrocuted is funny. If I were into electricity play this would certainly be an added bonus.Also, aforementioned exposed wiring causes this to short out completely very quickly. If you put too much pressure on the egg it will stop working. If you squeeze it too hard, it will stop working. If you don't hold it at a particular angle on days it decides to be fickle, it will stop working. I rolled over onto it in bed once and it completely broke. No outside damage and I weigh all of 120 pounds(what my mattress isn't cushy enough for this vibrator? Well, I never) so I'll chalk that up to it being cheaply made. Also the picture changes depending on what device you use to get on Amazon so I got one product while expecting another twice. I know it's only $6 but it's dangerous. I'll be reporting it to the CPSC. Just something to think about."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Not the best tasting, but doesn't have an over abundance of fats while still being super packed with protein. I stick to the chocolate peanut butter, I've tried a few others and these are the best as well as has some of the best nutritional info. Takes a bit of getting used to if you are just starting protein bars, or if you've been eating the candied sugar packed brands but certainly isn't bad tasting."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"When I bought this I didn't think it would be so tasty. This tea has a very flavorful, sweet, natural taste. I am a big tea drinker and always hunt for a new taste and this is definitely at the top of my list."
health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,2.0,"When this works it does have a sharp blade that splits pills in half. Even so, the pills I must cut are rather small and I did not manage to get them exactly centered. Worse, was that I had to cut some pills in 4ths and 8ths. This is not really made for anything beyond halves so I won't fault the product on this inability - so I was back to the razorblade for the smaller pieces.In any case, the darn thing has a flexible piece of plastic that works as some sort of ""hinge"" and this came loose after about the 10th use and I never was able to put it back and have it work right - this is why I must give it a low star rating as it basically fell apart quickly. So now I am back to using the razor blade for all my pill cutting. I wish there was some sort of device that could do multiple pie cuts on pills or some other answer - these small pieces are driving me nuts."

I'm not sure if this would work for losing weight while sitting on the couch, but if you can drag yourself to the gym and warm up for 10 minutes, you'll close the place down. I take 2pills around 6 or 7pm, and workout from 9-12 at night. I mostly do running, swimming, and cals.EXAMPLE"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"For many years we depended on this bean soup mix on wilderness backpacking trips, and then our local stores stopped carrying it. I'm very happy to discover that I can buy it from Amazon, and it's still exactly the same product that we knew and loved.It's a versatile mix that combines well with other dried foods such as rice, sun dried tomatoes, or bacon bits. By varying the amount of water, you can make a nourishing hot soup for a cold, wet day, or a dip to enjoy with tortilla chips from the last town at the edge of the big woods.I used to cook it with McCormick dried soup vegetables that we bought in the spice aisle at the grocery store, but that product has disappeared as well. So for my test run tonight, I substituted Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix. Even better than I remembered!Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix (10 oz, Quart Size Jar) for Cooking, Camping, Emergency Supply, and MoreBlack Beans with VeggiesPlace 1/2 cup of Harmony House Foods Dried Vegetable Soup Mix in 1-1/2 quart pan. Add 3 cups of water and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low and cook 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 package of Fantastic World Foods Instant Black Beans. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes. Spoon onto tortillas or crackers and top with cheese. Serves 2."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"Recommend it to all. Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker. I loved it during a URI, upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous. Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing. I now brew it for cold tea as well. Very refresshing."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"This is the smartest purchase I ever made for myself. I suffer from terrible muscle spasms in my neck, shoulders and back and taking Mag-Tab SR has not only relaxed my muscles but alleviated headaches caused by the spasms. I have tried other magnesium supplements but this sustained release is the one that works for me!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"I thought I would try Curvelle because I wanted to try something cheaper than what I was buying before and because it had decent reviews. I understand it isn't a magic pill, but I did expect it to suppress my appetite...which is what I wanted. It didn't work at all. I took if for a few weeks with no change in appetite. Save your money."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I was reading a book on how to relate to the universe to get it to send you things [I know, I know...] and the idea was that you had to visualize clearly what you want and you have to feel like a winner. I had also read that the single biggest factor in success among men across all occupations was the testosterone level and that testosterone makes a man feel like a winner. I did a little research and I came across this herb. I bought this brand because they seem to have good products. I've used their stuff over many years and was never disappointed. I've been taking the product for a few weeks. I do know the effects of HGH, I have taken Bovine Growth Hormone before, with this herb I almost immediately was feeling the HGH effect and I have taken on the mentality of a winner actually. I've been doing other things to silence the inner voices that make me feel like a loser[feeling like a loser lowers testosterone], affirmations and whatnot, but I'm certain that the herb is playing a big part in the transformation of my inner landscape..."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,5.0,"After breaking my leg, I was searching for an ice-pack that was not hard- it was painful to rest my leg on a firm pack. This is the best I've ever found. Soft and cold! I can wrap it around my leg either overlapping or not- this allows me to extend the area that is cooled. And it warms easily as well. My mother-in-law liked it so much that she purchased the 'foot wrap' for herself after rupturing her achilles tendon. We are both highly satisfied.I read the reviews about the thinness of the cover and how it snags on the velcro. It does snag, and the fabric is pulled where it is snagged, but it doesn't make a hole or compromise the function. One nice thing- it is not so cold that you have to put a barrier between your skin and the wrap. And it doesn't sweat- so your limb is not wet after using it.Great product!"
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"I have been using this for 2 weeks, and all but one night, I was sound asleep within an hour. No hangover, no morning grogginess. When I would awake in the middle of the night, I quickly fell back asleep. NutraSleep is just short of a miracle. I had tried another product that worked fairly well, but didn't act as fast. I can't believe how effective this product has been. I take 3 - tried both 2 and 4 - and found that 3 was sufficient to produce sleep. The ingredients appear to be safe in such a low dose. I can only hope this solves the sleep problems wrought by menopause. I like it so much, I've set it up for auto-delivery :)"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,4.0,"I have tried several kinds of sinus masks for my headaches and this one is soft and flexible. As others have stated, it only stays cold for about 20 minutes so I just ordered a 2nd to keep one cold on those bad headache days. Worth the money!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am 5' 6"", 102lbs female and I used the orange Ready Clean to pass a drug test for employment. This stuff works great. BUT be sure to follow the directions! This is not a miracle drink, you cannot expect to ""indulge"" the day before or day of the test and expect to pass just because you drank this stuff. I was clean for 2 weeks prior to using it. I drank a good amount of water during the week leading up to the test.On the day of the test, I gave myself a four hour time frame. Eat normally! I had my usual cup of coffee, ate a bowl of cereal, then drank a bottle of water before drinking the Ready Clean. After you drink it, refill the bottle (as the instructions tell you) with water and drink it. After that, do not consume more than 16oz of water every two hours. Wait ONE HOUR before taking the test. Ready Clean is most effective 1-2 hours after consumption. So if you drink it at 11am, you'll want to take the test anywhere between 12-2. If you take it before or after the time frame, you're risking failing the test. I drank a Gatorade (be sure you pee at least 5 times before taking the test to flush your system) and then took the test and everything went great.I wanted to put a really thorough review on here because I was horribly nervous about using this product. But I know many people who have used this, including myself now, and passed with flying colors.I definitely recommend this product. Also as a side note, it is kind of nasty to drink. But I have a very weak stomach and managed to get it down fine and keep it down, so it's really not that horrible. I suggest keeping it room temperature so it's easy to chug! :) Goodluck!!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Have been giving these tablets to my 8 year old Old English Sheepdog for about 6 months.

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,"My 7 year old granddaughter was having trouble concentrating in class and doing her homework. We purchased these drops to try and help her to be able to focus better. It was promptly shipped and arrived as ordered. It has a peculiar smell, but she doesn't seem to mind.It does seem like she is better focused by taking them. We also combined the drops with coldwater fish oil."
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,5.0,"These are great tests! I really recommend them. My hubby and I weren't really trying but just leaving it up to chance. Whenever my period was late by a couple days I would get a little excited and want to test but hated spending $5-10 per test. I found these and love not having to feel guilty to test. The only pain with them is peeing into a cup first, but I just bought some small disposable cups and it wasn't so bad to get used to. I finally got a positive test on mothers day and my blood results just came back from my doctor, I'm only 3.5 weeks along, so I was only 2.5 weeks along when I got a positive result. That seems pretty sensitive to me! This is a must for anyone TTC."

It may do nothing, or it may really work.Never had any pain from it. Just a lot of rumbling down there.I asked the doctor about it, and he looked pained, and finally said that it probablywouldn't hurt me any.End of saga.Jerry ODell"

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I love this tea. I don't know if it will help with my raging hormones but it is so soothing to drink in the evening and the taste is wonderful. I think one reviewer said they got tired of the taste? I don't think I ever will. I definitly plan on reordering when I get low. I'm on my second box now. The reason I ordered this on Amazon is because they have this tea at wholefoods but it's so expensive and I would only buy it as a treat. Now I can drink it whenever because I just saved so much. I'll update this review regarding if it actually helps my pms. In the meantime, 5 stars."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I tried Bigelow's Pomegranite Pizzazz tea about 4 months ago and I've pretty much forgotten about all my other faves. I love the fruity taste that finishes without the bitterness or tartness of some other herbal teas. I drink this tea more than I drink water, which USED to be my ""go-to"" drink. I drink this morning, noon and night ~ sometimes even in the middle of the night! So if you like your tea to be lightly fragrant, rich in flavor and beautiful in color, this tea is for you. Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a cup of Pomegranite Pizzazz tea. Later on, I might try it iced since it's received good reviews when iced! ENJOY!"

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,I love the modern look of this drying rack. Skip Hop is one of my favorite baby gear companies. It came looking just as I thought it would. The only problem I have with it is that I wish it were a bit more sturdy for my glass bottles. Would recommend it more for someone using plastic bottles but will still work for glass.
health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,5.0,"I love these because they are contoured to allow one's eyeballs to move freely, and they are soft which causes them to leave no indentation lines on one's forehead or cheeks.

health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,The gloves themselves are huge. At least should be listed as an extra large size. They were constantly slipping off and getting in the way. Eventually I just gave up and got more expensive ones.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,I usually don't write product reviews but I felt compelled this time because these are probably the best tapioca pearls I've ever had.

I personally am not a big public feeder so haven't used it too much but everything about it feels and looks great. I did get a little hot and baby was warm by the time we finished nursing but I guess that's expected with all nursing covers."

The only popcorn we ever buy, One taste and you will be a repeating customer like we have been for the past 4 years now."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I never really liked tea. Not iced, not with peach, mango or honey. I didn't like chai with cream, rose hip or green tea with organic raw sugar. But it turned out what I really didn't like was tea bags and the taste you get from them. I've found out a little bit about tea in the last couple of years.First, the tea that comes in tea bags are dregs, they are the leavings, the split ends, if you will, of dried tea leaves. It doesn't sound like it would matter much, whole, intact dried leaves versus almost powdery crumbs, but it does. The taste of tea made with a bag is wholly different, it even looks different, a little cloudy, more opaque and the taste isn't as bright and assertive (sorry, I don't mean to sound like a tea snob, I'm not a food snob, I'm writing this while trying to keep the crumbs of my powdered donut from landing on my keyboard, mhhmmf!).The first time I drank a real tea, one made with leaves I was ill. I had a sore throat, runny nose and a slight temperature. We were moving and I had a long day of hard furniture moving labor ahead of me (somehow I always end up ill when we move so that the icky moving experience can ratchet up to truly horrific). We stopped at a coffee shop (I'd packed the coffee maker the day before, my bad) but coffee didn't sound like a great idea when I was so congested, so I bought a jasmine green tea, I picked it at random and was surprised when my to go cup arrived with a long, weird paper cone full of dried tea leaves. We were in a hurry, so I grabbed some sugar packets and headed out. That tea was a revelation, it smelled nice and tasted even better. It even made my sore throat less razor-y.I've since bought several full leaf teas and Irish Breakfast, this one in particular, is my favorite, it's great with a kiss of cream and a liberal spoonful of sugar. It isn't hard to brew and is adaptable, you can make it brisk and chewy at seven minutes or light and delicate at four.I used to buy this exact brand at my local natural food store, but buying it online from VitaminLife it tastes even better, perhaps it's the sealed pack and that the leaves arrive fresh and less crumbly (the tea at the store has been transferred into a clear plastic pourable jug, maybe its the sunlight, maybe it gets shaken and broken, I don't know, but this tea is like manna from heaven, it's even replaced my morning coffee sometimes (I'm a coffeeholic and the only time I've gone without for more than a couple of days was when I was pregnant)."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I'm drinking this green tea as I type up this review. I made a cup of the Bigelow green tea, and this store brand tea I used to buy because it was the cheapest one on the shelf. The other brand tastes weird and bad in comparison to the Bigelow tea. I guess I didn't even know what green tea was supposed to taste like before I bought this brand. The difference must be that the bigelow bags are sealed in a plastic pouch, tough as other reviewers have noted there are three to a pouch. This isn't a problem for me as I drink 2-3 cups a day anyways. I started drinking green tea simply for the health benefits despite the taste, but now I can drink it for both."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,ice cream frozen desserts,5.0,"This is a really cool product. For the first part you arn't paying a arm and a leg at the museums. It tastes pretty good. It is a wierd texture to explain. It is a chalky texture, but when it hits your mouth it gets creamy. Try to think its not cold frozen ice cream. its going to be like room temp. The only down side i see is the secondary wrapper inside. Its almost always broken or wripped. But, its nothing to ruin the product. Its sealed with the outside packaging. So i dont see why the other package is there. Unless its to help control the moisture."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Highly recommend this product to clear your eczema naturally. Worked really well and even gentle enough that we used on our infant son,who had a patch of eczema. You will be satisfied, actually thrilled with this product. I have used it for four years and will just die if it becomes unavailiable."
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,ice cream frozen desserts,1.0,"I'm not sure what my expectations were going in, but this wouldn't have lived up to them. It tastes like a cross between styrofoam and the marshmallows found in Lucky Charms cereal.I was looking for something to take along on 5-day mountain climbing trips, but I think I'll stick to the old standards from here on out.Might be okay as a one-time novelty for pre-teen kids, but it isn't something you'd want for a serious after-meal snack on a semi-regular basis."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"Okay, I have given this product a thorough testing. I started my journey with the Vyotech body sculpting lotion which I got for free with a supp warehouse purchase. I used that religiously for 2 months and noticed absolutely no noticeable/related weight loss or targeted fat loss other than that which I achieved from strict diet and tons of exercise during that time period. So I thought it was because that product wasnt as good as the one that cost $40 - ab solution plus. So after reading reviews that ab solution plus worked and people saw amazing results with spot treating fat loss I bought it and used it religiously for 6 weeks. It doesnt work. I lost weight and toned my mid section, but its because I did 30 - 50 minutes of cardio 5-6 days a week, maintained a reduced calorie diet (less than 2000 calories a day) stayed away from sweets, sodas, white rice/pasta/bread, all known unhealthy food (fast food/pizza/etc) - drank a ton of water, and weight lifted 4-5 days a week - including serious ab exercises like hanging leg raises, cable crunches, weighted side extensions for tight love handles, among others.I can honestly say that this product is bogus and does not target fat loss or help get a ripped mid section. Thats what I bought it for and I didnt just rely on the cream. I can feel my ripped 6-pack muscles and can slightly see them depending on how i stand/flex/lighting - but this cream did nothing to get me there.I believe the reviews that say it worked were written by people from the company. While this is probably a good hydrating cream for your skin, i think you can get the same results by using some jergens for 5 bucks. It does have menthol in it, so you will feel like its ""burning"" away the fat - but that is BS. And the menthol feeling stops happening after a week or so of religious use.Believe me, i wanted this to work so badly, i committed to it so much (even though my wife told me it smelled and to stop using it. This is just another product that prays on our desire for something to help us lose weight. Dont be fooled. Spend the $40 on something useful like a month of gym membership, or why protein powder for a meal replacement. you could even throw $20 in the trash and you would still come out ahead $20 over buying this product.Sorry vyotech, i bought it, used it religiously, and wanted to believe - but this is just bogus."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"I used this product 3 years ago and when I went back to the gym recently it was one of the first things that I ordered, it works as it says, I am a 5'7 with 150LBS and I don't care about size as much as about the look due to the goal of the exercise as it is to maintain lean structureThis product provided me with energy to do the exercise and also pump up the muscles that gave them good size and marvelous shape as using it on lean muscles is greatI would totally recommend this product"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I ordered this bottle of standardized Tribulus Terrestris 250mg a month or so back and noticed an increase in lebido almost right away. The Saponins at a 40% are responsible for this effect and also provide a slight energy boost that is nice to use before a workout or intercourse? This herb also helps a little with controling gyno,(bitch tits) but I have to use an anti-estrogen pill to really get better effects cause of the certain steriods I use. For male health and all around well being, I think this bottle of Tribulus w/saponins is just what us guys need, expecilly as we age!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"Having been plagued by nightly leg cramps, I've tried everything including a ghastly mixture of vinegar and garlic. (Yes, it worked, but I'd rather have the cramps !) Asking my trainer about this, he advised a drink that replaced electrolytes. Surfing here, I found this drink, with excellent reviews. It tasted great and the cramps disappeared ! There is a reviewer who bemoans the fact that it contains a minuscule amount of aspartame. My thought on this is that (see above title) No More Cramps is more important that the tiny amount of aspartame. Compare to the amount of sweetener in Gatorade !"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars.

health personal care,health care,allergy,5.0,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day. Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed, it drys my nasal membranes. So I get frequent nosebleeds. Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products. I found that Ayr produces a gel, nose drops, and a mist. I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful. When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding. My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I ordered the Original flavor. It tastes a lot like Alka Seltzer, only stronger. This product works really well. Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed. Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it. The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system. And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state. At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product. But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop. I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well. But you do have to watch your own body and adjust your dosage accordingly. I still take this product, but just not as often, and not on a regular schedule. Maybe that's just me. Do try it, but just be aware of what it can do."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I got this mattress protector because we are night time training our 4 year old. It is perfect. I don't think it would fit easily around a standard size mattress, but we have a memory foam mattress that is slightly smaller. I slid on easily and ziped up. And shipping was super fast (got it in 2 days when I only paid for standard shipping). Luckily we got it just in time for flu season. Really easy to wipe down and clean. I was surprised that it didn't really have much of a smell to it since there are so many reviews complaining about the smell. I have really sensitive sense of smell and there wasnt much of a smell and it went away after a few days. Great deal and you cant beat the price!"
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,1.0,"I didn't buy our mesh feeder from here, but did want to write a review somewhere to warn other parents. The pin in the hinge falls out after a few months of use, at least. I kept trying to jam it back in and it kept falling apart as our child used it. I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard. Be warned to not buy this particular feeder. I am trying to find the company's website to write to them about the issues. Our son loved using the feeder so I am going to find another brand that is safer."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"There are many different choline sources on the market and i've found this to be the same for all Choline Bitartrate supplements(mg for mg).This brand of Choline Bitartrate will give you just under 300mg of Citicoline per serving. This is by far the cheapest way to get your Choline.The best source for Choline is straight Citicoline (CDP Choline). The usual serving will give you 250mgs. See the brand name(a good brand by the way)Jarrow Formulas Citicoline, CDP Choline, 250mg, 120 CountDue to the many different diets people are now on it is likely they aren't getting a their daily requirement of Choline. Vegetarians not the only people at risk.The benefits(I hate that term since it is something the body NEEDS and should get from natural sources) of Choline are numerous.I should just refer you to wikipedia's page on Choline. Go to Health benefits(they are all sourced in the article).[...]I will paste some of the info from above link here""Health effects of dietary cholineCholine deficiency may play a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders,[2] One symptom of choline deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT.[22]It is particularly important for pregnant women to get enough choline, since low choline intake may raise the rate of neural tube defects in infants, and may affect their child's memory. One study found that higher dietary intake of choline shortly before and after conception was associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects.[23] If low choline intake causes an elevated homocysteine level, it raises the risk for preeclampsia, premature birth, and very low birth weight.[2]""""Pharmaceutical usesCholine is used in the treatment of liver disorders,[45][46] Alzheimer's disease,[47] and bipolar disorder.[48]Some studies show that as a supplement, choline is also used in treating hepatitis, glaucoma,[49] atherosclerosis, and, possibly, neurological disorders.[2]Choline has also been proven to have a positive effect on those suffering from alcoholism.[50][51]The current NIH funded research study COBRIT is gathering data regarding potential benefit of longterm citicoline treatment for recovery after traumatic brain injury.""Go to link to read source articles for each of these studies.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I've tried magnesium pills and no matter how much I took or when I took them I ended up with stomach problems. I got A-B Calm 10 days ago and it has worked from day 1. My restless legs were getting terrible. I couldn't get to sleep because my legs would jump so badly as soon as I got into bed. Just 1 teaspoon of this works for me. The first couple of nights I felt a tingling in my legs like they were going to jump and I kept waiting for it, but they never did. After that the tingling went away. Last night I went to bed early and forgot to take it. Sure enough, my legs started jumping. I got up, took the A-B Calm and went back to bed. I thought maybe they would still jump but they didn't. Dissolves easily in 1/2 cup of hot water (I just get hot water from the Keurig so I'm not boiling anything). Then throw in some juice or ice tea or something and drink. There is a slight vinegar smell but no issues when mixed. I'll be making sure I don't come close to running out of this!Update - It's been 7 months. I don't use it every night but then I'll get to a point where I need it every night for a week or two to keep the restless legs at bay. Still works immediately. Even on the worst night, I feel like they kind of want to move but they definitely don't. I will never let myself run out of this. Changed it up a little. Take the smallest amount of hot water from the Keurig and dump out a good amount. Leave just enough hot water to dissolve the teaspoon of A-B Calm. Stir till dissolved and then pour in some Cran-Grape or Gatorade and drink it. It's cool and the vinegar smell is much less.My mother has been battling cancer for a few years now. She's doing great but she hasn't been able to get a lot of sleep due to a major issue with restless and achy legs even since she started the treatment. I told her about this and gave her some to try. She didn't check with her doctor first (I told her to) and the first night she tried it she was hooked. She then told her doctor about it and he said it was fine. She mentioned it to the nurse that does her treatments and she had restless legs as well. She gave some to the nurse as I had to her and the now she is hooked as well. Can't recommend this enough. If you have restless legs, try this stuff!"

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,1.0,"Despite what some reviewers think, ""Black Lava Salt,"" while being ""black"" and being ""salt"" has nothing to do with lava. It is sea salt from any of many places around the world that is colored black with activated charcoal. Largely a decorative item. You could take Kosher salt and make this stuff yourself, I suppose. As a geologist, this current paroxysm about different salts seem inexplicable. NaCl is NaCl (or the mineral halite). Your taste buds are attuned to it in a very restrictive sense, regardless of the presence or absence of trace amounts of coloring stuff--it all tastes virtually the same--your tongue sees to that. Spend you gourmet $$ some more useful way!By the way, a pinkish-orange coloring in NaCl may be KCl (commercially, ""nosalt""), known as the mineral silvite. It has a distinctively bitter bite. (Another tongue taste option.) Maybe some folks like their salt on the bitter side, but most gourmets would probably cringe at the thought of tossing bitter salt on good food."

A few years ago, during treatment, I collapsed from Anaphylactic Shock. That permanently damaged my Epiglottis, the flap that covers (protects) your windpipe when you swallow food or liquids. I then began aspirating foods into my Lungs. As a result, I had 16 bouts with Terminal Pneumonia. I'm a fighter, so I survived, but only by the Grace of God.So now I experience a strong biting feeling in my deep throat. It causes me to cough uncontrollably.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,3.0,"These breashshields were recommended to me by a lactation consultant. The inside diameter does fit better than the medium size the pump came with but I really need it to be smaller as too much tissue is still drawn in.The outer shield part is too small, it doesn't even cover the dark areola. Medela shields get smaller as the inside diameter goes down. If your breasts are large with small nipples none of the shields will be comfortable. The opposite is true as well from what I've read, if your breasts are small with large nipples the larger 'correct' size for you will not be comfortable.If medela would make shields the way bras are made, with two measurements, it would be great.They get three stars because it's good there are size options, some pumps don't have interchangeable shields so it's good medela offers this option to the women the various shield sizes will fit. They also work ok. I ordered the soft shields (in their only size, medium) to see if they will work better than these and be more comfortable."

I wish Amazon carried the vanilla flavor which I like the best. I mix one scoop with nonfat Lactaid and three ice cubes and get a thick and satisfying shake. The company who makes the product should sell an environmentally friendly package. I would pour into one of the plastic containers and keep scooping from that. It is terrible to waste a container half filled with product. It's a terrific meal replacement and the company needs to get with the program with how they package and please Amazon, offer the vanilla! I add fruit for the morning shake and vanilla lends itself to that the best. A plain shake for lunch and a sensible, low carb dinner and I'm dropping pounds without feeling hungry and without having to obsess over what I am going to eat. Terrific product!"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,powdered drink mixes,5.0,"My wife and I have been big mocha frappe fans since we discovered them at McD's 2 yrs ago. But, at $3 for 1 medium size, it was getting out of hand. After a little research, I ordered a case of the Big Train Mocha (25 pack case)last month. I've been making them every other evening since my order arrived. Well, we were down to 6 envelopes, so I just ordered another case. If you have a Ninja blender, or similar, it takes less than a minute to make. Including whipped cream and Hershey chocolate syrup on top, it costs less than half what Macs charges, and I don't have to go out. Oh, and richer, better flavor. Substitute left over coffee for the 5 oz. of water and it's even better. Also, the bigger diameter ""milkshake"" straws are a good investment. A nice way to treat yourself while relaxing or watching TV. Enjoy!"

health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"My twins are super sensitive to pain and changing Band-aids usually it met with all kinds of screaming. And New Skin liquid bandage burns like acid.So this is a great substitute for:* those abrasions where only a layer of skin has been removed* blisters where the top layer of skin has broken (I still add a ring of blister padding/moleskin around the area with medical tape (or duct tape) on top, but this helps to desensitize the area nicely.)These seal the wound painlessly and provide a great barrier. Let dry and spray again to add a few coats for a thicker barrier. I also have to reapply regularly with the ""bandage Olympics"" the boys put this through. But it does the job well, especially on knees and elbows where getting a Band-aid on correctly is tough.For deeper cuts I usually use Super Glue - this product isn't really meant to glue those shut or to stop bleeding (use pressure first). For deeper abrasions, I would consider Tegaderm or similar."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"A year ago I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes. I am 5-10 and weighed 187 pounds at the time and my A1C was at 7.4. I did not want to start the medication my doctor prescribed just yet, I wanted a chance to get my blood sugar in check with lifestyle changes first. So I started to lose weight, exercise more and count carbs. My blood sugar readings after meals were still on the high side, and I found cutting down carbs was tough on me emotionally, as well. I was hungry a lot and not able to eat my favorite foods or enjoy dining out with my wife and friends.I decided to try carb blockers by Source Naturals, as I have found good success using their cherry extract pills to help control my gout.This product has worked wonders for me with very few side effects. I take two pills about 3-5 minutes before I start eating and my blood sugar readings after these meals are well within normal range. The difference between eating the same meal with and without these pills is night and day! I keep some at home and some in a container in my car for when I am dining out. I still cannot eat carbs like I used to, but I am enjoying some of my favorite foods again in moderation without worrying about blood-sugar spikes, and I find that going out to eat is no longer a stressful ordeal. Emotionally, I feel like I am no longer as restricted in what I eat and it has made me much happier.Nine months after my diagnosis, I am down to about 160 pounds and my A1C dropped to 6.0. My doctor told me if I maintain this level for my A1C I would not need medication.I am not touting this as a cure-all for Type II diabetes or saying you should not listen to your doctor or not take prescription meds. I am saying that in my personal battle to get my blood sugar under control, this product and brand was one thing that helped me achieve those goals and made a positive impact on my emotional and physical well being. I still count carbs and watch what I eat, but for now I am not on medication and don't have to completely eliminate my favorite foods."

I've doubled up on the Tranquility booster inserts (I drink ALOT of water during the day to avoid dehydration and feel great.) Tonight, I'll use some large safety pins, strategically and CAREFULLY placed to avoid tearing, to keep it stable, just where I need it most, then cover it with a large towel. I haven't washed it yet but I have air dried it in the dryer. That works fine. Then I spray it with odor control. Maybe I'll wash it every third time so it doesn't fall apart in the washer from over washing. Maybe I'll buy another one. Or two.The truth is, there is NO system I've yet found yet that addresses my typical old guy problem of ""REALLY gotta go, gotta go, gotta go"" five and six times a night.

baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"After leaving my Lansinoh pump at work over a five-day weekend, I had to buy the Medela Harmony as a replacement. I was so happy to get my Lansinoh back! Hopefully this review might help people who are deciding between the two. As background, I work two days a week and pump three times a day on those days. On all other days, I pump once overnight. For my needs I am glad I didn't shell out for an electric pump. While there are a few minor things that are better about both pumps, the bottom line is that the Lansinoh works better. Both pumps are quiet. The Lansinoh, however, is simply a better fit and more efficient at pumping - and that's all I really care about! The padded breast shield is very comfortable (the Medela doesn't have one), and I have had very few problems with the suction. I am able to pump a full bottle in 10-15 minutes. With the Medela I was driving myself crazy because the suction was so finicky. Also Medela has a nifty feature that allows you to press on one end until let-down, then you pump using the main handle. Sounds good and clever, but really it's pointless. I never use that feature, and with the Lansinoh, it's so easy just to pump more quickly until you let-down. Assembly is extremely easy and it's possible to pump one-handed. Really my only minor complaints are that it's a little difficult to clean the very inside of the main flange (my bottle brush doesn't quite reach; the Medela is better designed in that way), and it's not as compact as the Medela (which fits inside a make-up bag). I love Lansinoh products including the breastmilk storage bags, breastpads, and bottles. By the way, the bottles are interchangeable between these two pumps."

I really recommend anyone who dabbles in anti-depressants try substituting the prescription for this stuff. For me, 5-htp has all the noticeable benefits of the prescription stuff without any of the side effects. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.As for this packaging, the pills are a bit large for the mg but it gets the job done for a great price. There was one pill in the bottle that had split open but that's bound to happen."

I bought this product as a 2 fold fix for my diet to get omega fatty acids in my diet and to get a protein powder that didn't cause some digestive discomfort. What I didn't expect is a product that when I take in the morning seems to add pep to my step all day and leaves me not feeling hungry for a long time due to its fiber content. There is way more to hemp than what the government wants you to believe."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I was a huge fan of FlaxUsa's flaxseed, but after purchasing a 2 lb bag from Big Lots, I'm never switching back. The flaxseed has a delightful texture, and doesn't give off a gross taste if it's left sitting in liquid for too long. I find myself pouring 3 tablespoons or more into my oatmeal. So yummy!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,1.0,"Although I like the hydrocollator cover, when the vender displays a photo of TWO covers and words the advertisement as COVERS, a quick peruse would lead one to believe that there are two covers as displayed and as worded. It is only ONE cover. Very sly. I would not but from this vendor again unless they were to send to me the other cover, then change the photo and the wording to accurately reflect the purchase."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,5.0,"My husband's was on testesterone replacement for 20 months. We were TTC and read that the testesterone replacement would make him sterile. So I got him off the shots on January 20th. We got his sperm tested on March 2nd, sure enough, the count was zero. I had already had him taking the fertility blend starting in February. We just got his sperm tested again today. and count was up to 30-40 million, all normal and great mobility! after only 4 months on Fertility blend. So we will resume with TTC and hope we get a BFP soon!"

I let the company know and they sent me the missing Sesame Oil that week! Amazing customer service."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've been using Jay Robb's Egg White Protein powder for over a year on almost a daily basis. I've had wt loss surgery and a protein supplement is a must for me. I've tried other protein powders but nothing else has compared to me and I feel fortunate to have tried this one. I was struggling to find one that I liked and would actually use when I found this one. But, I've used this one (chocolate and vanilla) almost daily for over a year. The price is high and I have tried to find other brands I would like as much or better but have found none. I do not like the taste or the thought of artificial sweeteners so I think that is a big part of it for me since Jay Robb uses stevia instead of chemical sweeteners. Also, as much as possible, he uses natural ingredients in his products. That is a big, big deal for me! I can't say for sure, but I think he uses all natural flavors in his products as well. I'd love to try the strawberry but haven't had a chance due to expense of getting that one on top of my two staple flavors of vanilla and chocolate. The way I use it is I mix is with cold coffee and milk. I currently add 2 scoops of protein powder to my morning coffee/milk drink. I am terrible for if I don't like something, I can't get myself to eat it. If I didn't like this product, regardless of how much it cost, it would sit on the shelf and not get used. As it is, I go through an 80 oz bag in about 3 weeks. (yep.. expensive). I highly recommend this product."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I used to use ON Whey and decided to use the Natural Whey this time around. It tastes identical. I get the Strawberry flavor. The powder is a more white in the natural container versus pink in the regular whey containers. Once you add milk though, the powder turns pink. It has the same effect and is overall better for you. Amazon offers one of the most competitive prices with Prime so you beat tax and shipping charges. Overall, its hard to see my gain differences from regular ON Gold Whey because I cycled right on this one. I would recommend this and will continue to use this over any other whey out there."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I've been searching for a while for a strong black tea to be my morning pick-me-up. I do drink coffee, but I enjoy tea a great deal more. Most of the teas I've tried have good flavor, but they get bitter very fast if I've accidentally steeped the tea too long, which tended to spoil my enjoyment. I'd expect a smooth drink, and I'd end up making a face in reaction to how bitter the tea would be. So why don't you just make sure you don't steep it so long, I hear you ask. Because I'm not a morning person, and I'm not setting a timer for steeping my tea. That's a level of commitment I'm not prepared to make every day while I'm getting ready for work. I also drink my tea black, so I don't cover up flavors with sugar and milk.I've tried the Choice Organic English breakfast tea, and, while strong and flavorful, it falls into the bitter-if-oversteeped category. Given the good flavor of that tea, I crossed my fingers and went ahead with the purchase of this 6-box set. This tea, the Celtic breakfast tea, isn't bitter. The flavor is stronger than almost any other tea, as you'd expect from an Irish breakfast style tea. I also think is the best-tasting tea I've had; better than the expensive loose-leaf stuff you can by from Octavia or other brands. I was sold after the first cup of Celtic breakfast, and this will be the only tea I'll buy for a while.If you like a strong black cup of tea, stronger than English breakfast tea and with a slightly malty flavor, you'll like this Celtic breakfast tea."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,My 3 yr old rottweiler started limping on his front paws a few months ago & was eventually diagnosed with elbow dysplasia. I rested him as directed by the vet & even tried 2 anti-inflammatories w/no improvement. Surgery is a last resort so I started researching glucosamine products. A lot of the reviewers of this products had much older dogs & seemed to have great results so I went with this product.Unfortunately I'm not impressed. The product took forever to come & didn't come in the stated time frame. I've been giving it faithfully twice a day (this is the start of the 4th wk) & no improvement with his limping. He doesn't care for the taste one bit so I literally have to give it to him w/a syringe (which is a small price to pay if it improved or stopped the limping). I will finish the bottle but if no difference is noticed I plan on trying the Bellyrubs brand. I just might have to consider surgery afterall.

Prior to starting it (about a year ago) the ringing was ever present, loud and oppressive. If you're looking for something that may help, give it a try. Based on my experience 60 days is a good test period. I formerly took 3 per day, but later reduced the dose to twice a day. Episodes of intense ringing may occasionally recur, but later in the day begin to fade to something that can be lived with."

While the product is reasonably priced, it doesn't seem like too much to ask for more than one year of relatively light usage."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I've been purchasing the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Isolate for a long time, but recently the price has skyrocketed. I found Syntha-6 through a workout plan I was doing and decided to check the prices. I wound up getting a great deal on Amazon with Subscribe and Save and figured I would give it a shot. I tried the Chocolate Peanut butter. I always thought the ON Gold Standard protein tasted pretty good, but it was never something I wanted to drink when I wasn't working out. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Syntha-6 powder is one of the best tasting protein powders I've ever had. It tastes exactly like a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. There's more calories in 1 scoop of this than in the other protein, but it's well worth it for the taste. I highly recommend trying a tub of it for yourself. I've forgotten about all the other protein powders and will be purchasing this from now on."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I grew up in the Fiji. My grandma used to make coconut oil from scratch and sell it for extra income. I find it odd that people use coconut oil for cooking. To be honest, the only people in Fiji who used coconut oil for cooking were the ones who could not afford cooking oil. Food cooked in coconut oil tastes awful. If you are one of those people who have used coconut oil for cooking and did not notice any after taste then you did not use pure coconut oil.Coconut oil is good for external use like hair and skin. You can also warm it up and dissolve some camphor (cinnamomum camphora) into the coconut oil for psoriasis.All points aside, I am really happy with the product I received. I got an extra 200 ml for free along with the big 33.8 oz. I opened up the smaller 200 ml bottle and the oil came out of it easily. I applied a small amount on my hands and I know for sure it is pure coconut oil. I recommend this product and the price is right too."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Heather L. Parisi has already posted the healthy benefits of Stevia, so I don't need to list those. I have tried every sweetener on the market - all of the artificial sweeteners of course, and then when I decided to stop all artificial sweeteners I began to try all of the products containing Stevia. I tried the powdered products as well as the liquid forms. None of them compare to Now Foods Stevia Glycerite. It has the most sweet taste and no alchohol taste. It does take a couple of weeks to get the formula correct as to how much to use per cup of coffee or glass of tea. I make a gallon of tea and put in two teaspoons, but we like out tea especially sweet. Stevial is very, very, strong so it does not take much to sweeten. There is no after taste because there is no alchohol.We use it in cereal, coffee, tea, muffin batter, cornbread batter, just about anything we would use suger in we use the stevia. It is very versatile. I have found that the results of cooking with this Stevia to be great. We have traveled with this and had no problems at all. A 2 ounce bottle of Now Foods Stevia Glycerite is about $7.00 at the local stores. Online I have been able to find the 8 ounce bottle for around $13.00 - $16.00. Even with the shipping cost those prices are a huge savings over the local prices. Most times I can get free shipping. I buy the small two ounce empty bottles with the dropper online for about $2.00 each and transfer the Stevia into them. Then I am able to take the small dropper bottles in my purse and keep one in the car. I have not found heat to damage the Stevia at all. You may want to keep your Stevia Glycerite in a plastic ziploc bag as sometimes the bottle will become a little sticky if you are not careful. One thing though, if you do start taking the Stevia and using it at restaurants and such be prepared for a lot of people to ask you just what it is that you are putting in your drinks! They are so curious about the little brown or blue bottles they just have to ask.TIP* Make sure you are ordering the NON-ALCHOHOL version. The alchohol gives the Stevia a totally different taste. We do not like the Stevia with Alchohol."

Taking these tablets as directed did the job! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has reoccurring problems. Again, I am not a doctor, but I would think that taking these tablets on a regular basis would be a preventative measure for any future flare-ups. Of course, you want to watch your diet as some foods can bring on unwanted pain and suffering. I would say that by the time you get halfway through the bottle, if not sooner, you should be seeing very positive results. It depends on how severe your symptoms are. Mine were rather painful.

I went back and bought more so I could have some at work, some at home, and some on my motorcycle. I even sent some to my boyfriend in California in a care package (he's in the military and going through training) and now he's hooked on it, too. I love arriving at home, making myself a cup, and relaxing after a day's work. Several months after discovering this treasure, I was out to lunch and realized I wanted some chai tea. I didn't have anymore drink mix with me, so I stopped at my local coffee shop and picked up an iced chai. I've been ruined! I didn't care for the taste of the chai from my coffee shop anymore!

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I purchased this product for the purpose of megadosing therapy for my moderate/severe hormonal acne. Speaking from my own experience, this product is not as effective as other powder/capsule pantothenic acid supplements. The idea of taking fewer pills with the 1000 mg vs. the 500 mg was very appealing at first, but the results were not. This did not control oil production as well as the other formulas on the market.As a medical professional I can tell you why I think this is -- vitamin B5 is absorbed mainly in the upper intestinal tract. By taking a ""time-released"" or extended release version, the pill/vitamin does not break down sufficiently before bypassing this part of your tract, so your body does not absorb the vitamin in its entirety.The consumer would be better off sticking with the regular 500 mg capsules (brand probably doesn't matter).On a related note"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,2.0,"I've taken thermogenics for years and this is the only one that has given me flu-like symptoms. Taking it on an empty stomach, I feel out of sorts, nauseous, and sweaty for the next couple of hours. But taking it with food doesn't seem to affect me at all. In neither case have I felt a ""boost"" -- rather, when I feel it at all, I just feel hot and sweaty and kind of jittery. Maybe I still have to figure out exactly how to take it, but frankly I'm not sure it's worth it. Given all the negative reviews here, I'm a little concerned. I'm probably just going to stick with JACK3D, which always ALWAYS gives me a massive burst of energy and gets me up and moving!"

It is also good to use for clients who need to get back to work after massage or who just want to slide off the table and get into bed. It isn't greasy."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"*****I really like this form of B-6 for so many reasons. First of all, there are dangers in taking megadoses of Vitamin B-6. I tried taking a lot (and hopefully my body was utilizing it) but was afraid of the side effects, some of which are very serious, and there are horror stories all over the internet about people taking even 500mg/day; I was scared. In the past B-6 has helped me with carpal tunnel syndrome and other health problems; this time I am having problems with my feet and thought it might make a difference, but I felt uncomfortable with the megadosing. So with this form of B-6, apparently a small amount can be better utilized by the body, so you can take less. I like that.Also, I think it tastes just fine. There is an initial mint taste which quickly fades. It is not very sweet or flavored, so it just tastes like you have something under your tongue, which other reviewers have complained about. This doesn't bother me, as I have taken medicine sublingually for years and this B-6 tastes so very much better. So I'm fine with the taste. I don't mind taking 15 or 20 minutes for it to dissolve, either--you do have to plan to not be eating or drinking for that long, or not talking extensively also. The instructions suggest you change the placement under your tongue during the dissolving too, so that it is absorbed better--again, not a problem for me. But with these particular instructions, I'm not sure that this would be a good way for children to get their B-6. Or anyone who has trouble with the instructions.I think what is comes down to is that some people have basic B-6 needs and so will get their B-6 in a B-Complex or in a B-6 tablet or capsule. Then there are those of us who have a special purpose in taking it, who have seen it help particular problems we have. If that is you, I don't think you'll mind following the absorption protocol.Source Naturals is a brand I trust, too. I have other products of theirs, all of which have been good.UPDATE 8-4-12"

I tried the patch and it gave me an itch, I tried the gum and my jaws hurt... but worse of all I kept on smoking. A few years ago a friend suggested that I try QuitKey. Initially I was skeptical but also desperate to quit and at the price of less than $60, QuitKey sounded like a bargain. I found QuitKey easy to use and once I started the program it kept my cravings to a minimum.

I asked my Perinatologist before start taking this vitamins, I am on bed rest with a cerclage and taking progesterone shots so i want to make sure this is a right vitamin to take but the ingredient on this bottle has ""meadowseet"" and I found this:(Avoid use during pregnancy. Meadowsweet may increase uterine tone and might stimulate uterine activity)So, my Perinatologist found similar information and didn't recommend it for now. I may start taking it after I deliver my baby. I don't want to put on risk my pregnancy the herb has 300 mg in each spoon you can read the labels."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"This product met my expectations very well. The flavor wasn't quite what I expected, however. I expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla. Instead, I found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed. The end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor.The beans themselves are rather small. Because of this, I think, the coffee is rather weak. I find myself having to use 30% more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans. The cup, when poured black, has a very weak color to it, if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk.When I first tried the coffee I was very unhappy with the results. However, after tweaking the amount of grounds I use (as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds) I found a product that was palatable.Would I buy it again? Probably not. However, I can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Purchased this product knowing that even though I eat salads everyday I still don't get all the necessary greens veggies I should. It doesn't taste great alone but after a few tries I found that it goes very well with my morning fruit smoothie (bananas & strawberries conceal the after taste the best). It turns my shake into a dark green color but the flavor of the fruit conceals the after taste pretty well. I've just finished my first full bottle and have also found that this has improved my mood. I'm experiencing early menopause symptoms (I'm 41). My menstral cycle also came and went and I only experienced very minor symptoms. This is a great mood booster! I also want to mention that I also drink the Garden of Life Raw Meal and its possible that the combination of the two produces this great mood enhancement. I was not too crazy about the green color or after taste at first but now that I've gone through the first bottle I'm over it.

health personal care,health care,sleep snoring,4.0,I have seen several reviews stating this is just a placebo and won't work. I just don't believe that. I do however think it works for some and not for others. I have tried just about everything under the sun for sleep. I had been taking clonazapam which is a hard hitting sedative and it ended up making me sick. Because of clonanzapm I ended up having chronic insomnia for months. At first almost nothing would help but later on I was able to get some relief with antihistamine products. Initially Calms Forte didn't do much of anything for me but now I can take 3 and get a restful sleep. I am very sensitive to meds and this product does have some slight side effects for me. About 24 hours later I experience some nervousness that lasts about a day. It is not bad though so I feel the good sleep outweighs the little bit of nerves that I get.

It wasn't til I read the label that I realized it could also help with the anemia I suffered from regularly and had to get an iron shot for X-( That was the 70s and I have used it off and on ever since. There is no iron supplement that is going to work as quickly as SSS Tonic after all these years and many other iron supplements later...But lately I cant find it. And the local pharmacist literally said it is not for sale for HUMAN consumption....Thus the reason I am on here AFTER I checked to make sure it was still OK for human consumption! I am a teacher and when blood drives come up, I look for SSS Tonic so I can be positive I will be able to donate bc I am always low on iron.

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,I used to have a favorite snack that you may know of. It consisted of wafers of sugary sesame seeds. While pleasant to eat I didn't like eating all that sugar. So my new idea is to put a little honey on a tablespoon. Then you pour some sesame seeds on the honey and eat. Sesame seeds are high in phytosterols which can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. I also use these toasted sesame seeds in a granola recipe which is quite good. I've also used these sprinkled over meats or you might like them in salads.~The Rebecca Review

health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"In the middle of the night some time last week I woke up in excruciating pain. The big bone/joint of my big toe hurt to the touch and I felt like crying. I attempted to get up to walk to my bathroom so I could pop a couple Ib profen. Well, that turned out to be WAY harder than it sounds. Could barely walk. Same goes for the next day, and the next day after that, and probably after that. I thought it was a bunion, upon research and finding out my dad has one too. These babies are mainly hereditary. It slowly got better within about a week, which is when I got my bunion regulator. It's still a little tender but I am wearing this to bed. It isn't too uncomfortable at all, it just takes some time getting used to this ""thing"" around your foot. But I definitely recommend this product, as I can see it clearly pushing my toe in the direction that I want it to be. If this is a bunion problem, hopefully this realigns me and stretches out all those tendons like I want it to!"
health personal care,health care,unknown,5.0,"In only 1 induction dose (3 dissolved tablets in her water bowl) of this remarkable homeopathic formula, Dixie, my 10.5 years old Heinz-57 pup who had been lying down and hiding out in her crate for most of the previous week due to her early onset arthritis inflammation and pain, was up scampering around and playing with her ball after only 1 hour's time with this medicine in her system! How's that for an excellent review? The proof is in my girl's behavior and demeanor (I can almost detect a shy smile in her sweet face, again). Now we can resume our walks, with much less pain and distress than before. And, we can both look forward to a much better quality of life, in our senior years, together. I'm very pleased to know that this homeopathic preparation is perfectly safe for Dixie to take every day as her maintenance arthritis medicine. No fears here concerning canine liver or kidney failure, due to the harsh synthetic drugs of so many veterinarian Rx meds! Just the slower, safer path to healing and restoration. Thanks, HEEL BHI!"

grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk,4.0,"I'm always illegally importing dairy products into the US to give my food the 40%+ fat necessary to create a truly European experience. Using this Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon 128 fl oz, however, is just over the top! It's so creamy rich my customers can no longer eat more than one bite of my Panna Cotta without becoming drowsy and on the verge of a sugar coma. Usually we like customers who eat themselves into a caloric stupor, as they tend to use their cell phones less often in the dining room and tend to over-tip. But, when a Friday night run of Panna Cotta orders for dessert means 80% of our tables have people sleeping at them, the dining room loses a certain flair. So, I'm going for the four stars, but recommending Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon 128 fl oz for home use only. Consider it a replacement for the main ingredient in your 1970s LSD parties, and follow all the same rules."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My daughter has suffered from severe pustular psoriasis since she was a toddler or maybe earlier. Her flare-ups usually cover her entire torso from neck to waist, front and back, and sometimes cover her legs to the ankles, too. After going from Pediatrician to Dermatologist to a top Pediatric Dermatologist, we finally got a definitive diagnosis when she was 4. And after trying a number of prescription and OTC medications and treatments, we finally got control of it when she was 5 using a combination of methotrexate (taken orally) and this product, Cutar, applied topically. The methotrexate seems to keep her about 95% clear all on its own, and the Cutar takes care of the few remaining spots and patches. Between the two we can keep her nearly 100% clear most of the time. The Cutar is also pretty effective on its own when applied 2-3 x per day, as we discovered when we had to take her off the methotraxate for a spell to allow her immune system to help her kick an ear infection"
grocery gourmet food,breakfast foods,breakfast cereal bars,4.0,"Some of the reviewers eat these for weight control purpose, which I don't think that's what these bars are for. 20g protein bars like these are designed for muscle recovery after weight lifting workout. ThinkThin protein bars use whey protein isloate; which is the best protein for muscle recovery. I've been eating Cliff Protein bar for body building, although it's 95% organic but it has too much sugar. ThinkThin protein bars provide same amount of protein as the Cliff Bar with less sugar.These bars use sugar alcohol, instead of conventional sugar. Sugar alcohol is a sweetener commonly found in ""Sugar Free"" gums. It has less calories and doesn't cause tooth decay as conventional sugar does. Nonetheless, it's a sugar. I hope ThinkThin would start making these with organic ingredients.For those who are interesting in snack bars (instead of protein bars) for weight control,Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)are awesome."

Before becoming vegetarian, however, I'd already had this problem because I ate a lot of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

SERIOUSLY NO EXAGGERATION AT ALL!!! I had just come home with my baby and was very disappointed!!!! My husband is a design and manufacturing engineer and opened up the breast pump to try and troubleshoot the machine, only to find that the parts were extremely cheap and poorly designed and put together, he found there was a problem with the way the screws were set up on the motor part that controls the suction, but because the machine is such a piece of crap, he couldnt even fix it-----(my husband designs products for a living, so he knew what he was doing!!) I only plan on breastfeeding for 3 months, luckily my hospital will allow me to rent a medela pump!! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!

health personal care,health care,foot care,1.0,"It is shameful how rare I leave reviews, when Amazon is my absolute first ""go to"" when it comes to reviews. I am in the habit of mulling over every review in an effort to help make informed decisions on what I buy. All of that said, I hope my assessment of this will help someone make their own decision on this product too. Very recently I started suffering from excruciating heel pain. I started reading everything I could on plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. I came across these HEEL THAT PAIN heel seat and read so many mixed reviews, but out of desperation I knew it was just something I had to try on my own. I can appreciate the design of this heel seat had my pain been at the very end of my heel, but my pain is where my heel begins just past the middle of my foot. Back to design, these heel seats are raised in the precise area where my pain is. All of my weight is concentrated completely on this raised area of the heel seat and if you have pain where I am describing, these heel seats will make your pain much much worse. Not all heel pain is the same. If they would come up with a new design to lessen the pain in this precise area, then maybe that might be something, but they have seem to categorize all heel pain to only one area and that is the very back of the heel. I read in another review from a gentleman that said it was like walking on a broomstick -to that I agree 100 percent on that assessment. Now I know. Now I can say I tried them for myself. Had I read a review of WHERE on the heel it just didn't work, then I would not have bought them. The outside of the box has a ""caution"" section that pain is to be expected at first. Well, can't they see that not every kind of heel pain can be categorized as the same pain? It baffles me their encouragement to keep walking on these even if you are in pain. This could really be doing someone so much more damage than good. To my experience, I wore them for only 1 hour to the grocery store and for a week I was not able to walk without limping in pain. I learned a few tips that have helped when I know I will be walking a lot. I took off the labels of canned peaches and put them in the freezer, and as soon as I take off my shoes I am rolling my heels on the frozen cold cans. This helps to keep the swelling down so the pain is minimal, and it also exercises the tendons in your foot. That alone has helped me tremendously. Right now I am just experimenting with what works and what doesn't work. I wear just a very light shoe, and I have a simple gel pad inside to lessen the impact of each step. I hope this helps someone out there make an informed decision if you are suffering from heel pain too."

While the tray doesn't snap on when carrying it all you do is put one of the straps that are used to fasten it to a chair around the tray tightly and it holds it in place.FYI - according to the box it is good for a child up to 50 lbs (it doesn't seem to mention it in the description here)."

After only six weeks on the lowest recommended dosage of 2 capsules daily, my total cholesterol has dropped to 213, my triglycerides have dropped from 160 to 1233 and my HDL went from 32 to 41. I do not have any of the side effects I experienced with prescription cholesterol-lowering drugs. Very happy with the Solaray product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,"I bought this product and I am in the third day taking it. I have taken the hydroxycut hardcore pro series and it worked well. Obviously you are going to have a rapid heart beat with this much caffeine. I am not new to these type of supplements. I have no idea what changed from the pro series to this one. My first day taking the recommended 4 pills in the morning and afternoon and I'm in a lot of pain. My chest has sharp pains going though it every minute. I took my last set of 2 pills around 2pm and its 2am and it still hurts.I am very frustrated because I loved the results I received from hydroxycut pro series and was expecting the same with this new formula, but unfortunately this formula feels more dangerous.Other side effects include sweating profusely and being extremely cold. I am at work and my hands are ice cold but they are drenched in sweat. I can't focus at all, instead of feeling alert and ready to go I feel nervous, distracted and like my body is having an extreme meltdown.So to sum it up I love hydroxycut but definitly would recommend going with the pro series formula. I will be returning this product because the side effects are not worth it. There are other products with the same caffeine doses that give the same results."
health personal care,health care,stress reduction,3.0,"This isn't really a supplement for adderall or anything similar. If you are having a hard time focusing, this did seem to help me for 1-3 months. However I do not find it's helping me study, work, or focus any longer. As previously mentioned it didn't have any other commonly associated features of adderall (if you're looking for them or not), like decreased appetite, energy, etc. Each persons different I've found when it comes to these kind of medications, and it's definitely worth a shot if you need help focusing or studying. Take the recommended dosage for at least a month. I definitely found this significantly more effective then adderrlin.. Good luck!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I chanced upon this tea, a mix of herbs and black tea, by chance. I drink herbal teas but never enjoyed them. I enjoy the flavor of this one. I would urge all to try it, you'll like it...A devotee of hot drinks, a scourge of the complex ""things"" they sell in coffee shops which require a recipe and instructions to order..el viejo"
health personal care,health care,family planning contraceptives,1.0,"It doesn't work!!! It told me I was fertile and I wasn't even wearing it. It actually just goes by your cycle, not the sweat on ur skin. I work nights so I wore it during the day, when I got home from work at 8am on day 11 it already said ""fertile"". Don't pay the money for a watch to count your cycle!!!!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,NAC 600 mg 3/day = stops nail biting after 2 weeks. Also good for reducing baseline level of anxiety. This is the least expensive form (Swanson) I've found.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"My son got me some of these PROMAX bars for Christmas. It was surprising, but one day I tried them and they were great. Now I eat them 5-6 days a week. They make me feel good, satisfy my hunger and keep me alert and on task all morning. The other plus for me is that this variety is GlutenFree, which is a must for me. I'm taking a vacation soon and will bring a box of these bars.Great service from the vendor. Highly recommend."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"Growing up in the South, this sauce is a staple in the fridge; however, after moving off, it's been a struggle to find it. Everytime we go home, my husband and I buy 4 or 5 bottles to hold us over until our next trip home. I was super excited to see it available through Amazon. A versatile sauce"
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"We had a long road trip home coming and we needed a portable bottle warmer. We took a chance on this one since it was cheap and if it didn't work we weren't out much and could stop on the way and pick up a more expensive one. That was not necessary, this bottle warmer worked quickly and effectivly. It takes about 10 minutes to take a bottle from room temp to warm (our little lady likes them a little warmer than most, too). It seems like people thought they could get a warmer that acted like a microwave and would heat the bottle in seconds... We still use it, now for jars of baby food and it works amazing for those as well, taking only about 3 minutes to heat those. I would recommend this for anyone!"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,Doctor recommended these because they have a hard bottom which helps to keep foot from bending. I bought two pair and used them in all my shoes. Excellent product.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,An excellent meal replacement and fantastic product for weight loss. Very quick to prepare in shaker. Mix well in water and thick liquid. Very filling. Highly recommended.
grocery gourmet food,dairy eggs,milk substitutes,3.0,Just be careful because it's a heavy box! I bought it as a gift and had to travel by plane with it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"For under $45 (5 Lb package), this is among the best of its kind that I can find. Its taste suits me really well, less sweet than most of other competitors. Natural sugar in this product not only enhances the flavor, but also removes any doubt on long term negative impact of artificial sweetener that is widely used in many other competitors. Artificial sweetener, which has absolutely no long term safety data to support its mass usage, should not be associated with any ""health promoting product"". Shipping by vitamin shoppe was super fast, too."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I used to love this product. I had been using it for three years and had recommended it to many people who also loved it. However, the last time I purchased the Vitamin E sticks, three of them broke at the base with just normal use. It seemed like the product was softer than usual. I contacted the company (Reviva Labs) by email but never heard back from them. I am afraid to purchase it again since I lost out on three sticks and the company never bothered to contact me."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,1.0,"i thought they were as good as the traders joe almonds, but because of the free shipping i ordered, but when i tasted them , they were a little over bake for me. then, they only have little sesame, i will not buy this product again"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,This product had no benefit at all. Do not waste your money. I purchased this product about two months ago and I have taken roughly 200 pills.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips crisps,4.0,"So I bought these when I saw a great deal on deals.woot.com about a coupon they had and I had seen them in stores a few times but never took the plunge.These are tasty, although sometimes a little hard for my taste, and a little higher in calories than I would like in a snack (200 calories per bag)But, it does satifsy my sweet tooth nicely and is much better than candy or a donut, and easy to tuck in my gym bag or desk drawer. The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste. Taste is great!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I started taking this product for specific health problems I have. I have been reading the book Primal Panacea, and I am impressed with the research and the many different conditions that are helped by Vitamin C. The advantage of this product is that it delivers far more bio-absorbable Vitamin C than any other method short of intravenous (which definitely does NOT interest me!) For this reason, also, it becomes economical to take a therapeutic dose. I put a little bit on a sore each day, topically. I don't know how well that works with the Lyposomal feature, but it does seem to help. Taking it is an interesting experience. It has a strange, somewhat peculiar taste and texture that is tolerable. Mixing it with water helps. In the two weeks since I started taking it, I have noticed considerable improvement in my overall state of well being. I just hope I can get it as long as I need it. I am tripling my dose as soon as the new order arrives. I will also resume eating bell peppers, one of the richest natural food sources of Vitamin C. I went to the dentist years ago, and at that time, she said my gums were too much of a mess for her to do anything, so she rescheduled my appointment, and told me to do something to improve my gums. I ate a bell pepper a day. When I went back, she was astonished at the improvement in my gums and asked me what I was doing. Since starting Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C, I have also noticed a substantial improvement in my gums. Coupled with daily CoQ10 seems to keep them quite healthy.No matter what your health problem is, especially if it is related to any infectious agent, this is a remedy well worth trying. Try it especially if you have a skin condition of any kind.Primal Panacea"
health personal care,health care,foot care,5.0,"I looked at the various insertable cushions to put in my docksiders. I usually get Dr. Scholls. But reviewers convinced me to try less expensive Spenco cushions. They are okay, my arches don't hurt anymore. Good alternative to Dr. Scholls."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"This hot sauce has a fantastic flavor. However, it was not as hot as I'd expected. I assumed habanero hot sauce would be enough to REALLY spice up a dish, since I can't eat a whole habanero without my eyes welling up with tears. This was not the case. This stuff is really mild compared to the pepper it's made from.That said, I have no regrets about buying this product. If you're looking for a really tasty, fairly thick sauce that's comparable to tabasco in heat, this sauce is for you. If you want something that will kick up a burrito all on it's own, look elsewhere."
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"As a big guy, my feet are under a lot of weight (obviously) and extremely flat. These orthotics help me to ward off plantar fasciitis. I also have very bad knees and these seem to help a bit with that pain too. In sneakers (New Balance) I remove the wimpy insoles and leave these Lynco L420's in permanently. I have another pair of L420's that I switch among my dress shoes and Top Siders. They do seem to ""hold"" your foot odor and I've not tried to determine a means of cleaning them. I use Lysol or similar spray now and then; but when they get too bad, I toss them and buy a new pair. I would have gone for 5 stars if they could be easily laundered or perhaps treated with charcoal smell suppressant."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,These were by far the best I have ever ordered. Very absorbant. I was able to sleep through the entire night without a change.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,weight loss products,1.0,This product does not do anything for weight loss! Or did it do anything spectular for my thyroid! A waste of money.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,2.0,"My pre-workout for awhile was Hemo Rage Ultra Concentrated, It was amazing but I had to stop because it was giving me nose bleeds. So I went with N.O.-Xplode. The taste is not too good, the only way I can put it is that it taste's like a tree. I weigh 160 pounds and to get any results you have to take at least 2 scoops. For the money I'd say it is not worth it, better off going with Hemo Rage for the real bang for your buck."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,sports supplements,5.0,"damn things are enormous!But can't complain too muchThis isn't a drug or performance product, so don't expect any immediate difference in (virtually) anything.also not sure how this compares to actually eating liver instead (nutrition/price wise), but its definitely more convenient :-)"
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I love this tape. I use it for so many things...it is very much waterproof. I put it on my heels for shoes that rub - itchy patches of skin, for padding on the neuroma on the bottom of my foot. It sticks really well and has cushioning."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"The cost/count for this product can be misleading because each capsule contains only 250 mg of HMB. Per label instructions, you need to take 4*3 = 12 caps a day to obtain the recommended 3000 mg dose, so each bottle is only a 10 day supply. Some other brands show a more expensive cost/count, but deliver 1000 mg per capsule, so you take only 3 caps per day and they're a much better value. Consider the cost per DOSE instead of cost/count."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"If you like Amaretti, you we not be displeased with this product. They are expensive (they are a once-a-year purchse for me), but they're well worth it. I think the price also reflects the great tin the cookies come in. These babies just melt in your mouth and send you right to heaven."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy. I love it! his will definitely be a repeat order."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,3.0,"This tea didn't really work for me. I hate tea but this was easy to drink, it has a slight black licorice taste. It was worth the try."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,As always these keep you full and are very yummy! I love how they are a denser bar with some crunch. They really do fool you into thinking you are eating a candy bar- I have such a sweet tooth so this is a good thing.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I am a fan of peppermint, I used to get a wonderful peppermint tea for iced tea and it went off the market a few years ago so i returned to my tried and true black iced teas until recently. My wife and I found this tea, we love ginger as well, and I decided to try it in my iced tea maker with a bit of Stevia to sweeten it. Lo and behold, a delightful, refreshing iced tea emerged and we've been fans ever since. I found that putting this three pack on a monthly subscription makes it very affordable and we always have enough tea to get through the month.In summary, this is a very good quality mint and ginger tea and I highly recommend it -- best one I've had!"
health personal care,health care,first aid,1.0,"THESE GAUZE'S SHOULD BE NAMED ""SILLY STRINGS"". THIN BEYOND DESCRIPTION, FALL APART WHEN CUT, AND NON ABSORBANT JUNK. WORTHLESS!NOTHING AGAINST THE SELLER AS FAR AS PRICE AND SHIPPING BUT IF I WAS A SELLER I WOULDN'T CONSIDER PUTTING THIS CRAP IN MY INVENTORY FOR ANY REASON."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,It did nothing. Suggested by Dr. Oz. That was a bad call. Small company. The product didn't look very professional.
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,This fits in my wallet - so always great to have handy. It totally reduces swelling and redness and immediately rids me of pain. Would recommend to everyone that has problems with bites or stings.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,2.0,"I am a big fan of Terra sweet potato chips for their nutrition and flavor, so I figured I would try the spiced chips. They aren't terrible, but something about the smell reminds me of body odor. I would imagine it is the cumin, so for some it might be an acquired taste.As for the packaging; They were delivered and left in the sun for a couple hours (we are currently having a 100+ heat wave) and 7/12 of the bags exploded in the box. I think Terra may put too much air in the bags."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"We use this for pancakes and waffles every morning and it is absolutely delicious! If you are looking for real maple syrup instead of an artificially flavored table syrup, this is the way to go. I triedHighland Sugarworks Pure Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, 32-Ounce Jugbut found that the Coombs Family brand has a smoother, more maple-y taste. This Grade A Dark Amber provides a flavor similar to a table syrup, without the artificial chemically taste associated with those. If you are considering a maple syrup for baking or just like a stronger flavor, I would go with a Grade B."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,5.0,This is the best chicken broth you can buy....it has a great taste and once you start using you you will see the difference in this product....it last a long time and stays well in the back of your fridge!
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I have to say I'm a guy, so I'm not using this product for it's intended purpose ;-). I need a foot rest. There are several choices. I homed in on this unit because it is an all-around great fit for what I need it to do. It's adjustable, angled, has non-skid pads, and doesn't look awful. Assembly requires about 5-10 minutes. There are eight screws. Possible even for the mechanically-challenged. If you work a lot at a computer, you deserve something like this to take the pressure off your lower back."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,dried beans,5.0,"I really am enjoying this wild rice blend. I intend to continue to use this brand. My first shipment got lost somewhere along the way, before delivery. I let Amazon know and they kindly sent another shipment. So GOOD wild rice, and GOOD doing business with Amazon."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I decided to give this herbal supplement a try after first searching for natural remedies to help lower blood pressure. Most results suggested this product and the reviews for its usage were above average to ""absolutely satisfied""- which brought me to Amazon to seek out and purchase. I will continue the trend by saying that if you are tired of synthetic medications and want to go a more natural route- give this a try. Of course, use your common sense- if you are being treated by a physician, run it past them first, but the side effects are only relevant to the amount of the Passionflower that is used. If you are taking additional meds it is a safe bet to go to a pharmacy and/or check online to see if there are any drug interactions that may cause harm (Of course, that is with anything you ingest).Similar to most medications, it takes a few days for adequate concentration levels to have an effect on your blood pressure levels but the ""tranquility"" effect can be noticed almost right away. I tend not to absorb pills well all of the time so I ordered the liquid drops too, followed the instructions but cut it in half for the daytime dosage and I notice that I react less to the stress of my work environment, especially when I take it about an hour before going into work. If you experience anxiety and stress at work- I HIGHLY recommend it (seriously).My blood pressure after only five days of use went from 149/105 to 131/90. Believe me, I understand that those measurements are only snapshots and most of the time can be lower or higher overall but I had been testing my B/P over a period of a few weeks and received similar results. I have since been taking the Passionflower twice a day for two weeks and I will go back and test it again to see if there are additional improvements. Mind you, it is ultimately best to make lifestyle adjustments (lower salt intake, get adequate exercise) which I have always done but to help immediately lower it while you make those adjustments, and for those who for health reasons cannot afford to start off running or doing strenuous exercises (which make the B/P higher naturally) I suggest this 100%.Good luck to you if you decide to give a try."
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"I love this rack. It holds a ton of stuff in relatively little counter space (which is a big deal for me). My one objection is that mildew builds up under the spinning rack because the bottom doesn't drain or dry well in our humid climate. To solve that problem, I regularly put the whole thing in the dishwasher. I rubberband the spikes together and seperate the levels and toss it in. To date I haven't had a problem doing that to it. No melting or cracking. It's holding up well. Recommend this rack!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Despite its strong odor and inability to be taken orally, Tea Tree Oil has gained in popularity becuase it helps fight fungus, bacteria, and viruses. It is used to treat a number of infections including infections that are resistant to some antibiotics and is used as remedy for hundreds of bacterial and fungal skin ailments such as acne, abscess, oily skin, blisters, sun burns, athlete's foot, warts, herpes, insect bites, rashes, eczema (to prevent secondary infection), dandruff and other minor wounds and irritations.Studies have shown that Tea Tree Oil also treats respiratory problems ranging from common sore throats, coughs and runny nose to severe conditions such as asthma, tuberculosis, and bronchitis though you need to follow the doctor's advice on how to use tea tree oil for those as it is toxic if taken internally.One of the most interesting aspects of Tea Tree Oil are the anti-viral properties against common infectious diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and measles, flu, cold sores and verrucae.I like to have some around in the first aid kit and find the NOW 4 Oz does the job perfectly for me. The oil itself is as good as any of the 1 oz pharmaceutical grade tea tree oils I have bought at Walgreens and it comes in a bigger container priced much less per oz.For all of these reasons, I give it 5 stars."
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,We take this thermometer with us everywhere. It is extremely accurate once you figure out how to use it (and make sure the plastic cap is off). My girls get sick often and this has never let us down.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,canned jarred food,1.0,"I love split pea soup, and normally I make it from scratch, but it can take an hour or more. When I saw that this product cooked in a mere 10 minutes, I was pretty excited. I figured it was probably composed of cooked and freeze-dried peas that basically just needed to be reconstituted, and of course some kind of seasoning. I didn't read the ingredients on the bag, though, until I got home. Oops.Reading the list of ingredients, I was immediately skeptical. The first thing listed was modified corn starch. Corn starch?! Split peas create a thick enough soup, I can't imagine why they needed corn starch, let alone why they had to use more corn starch, by weight, than actual PEAS. I went ahead and prepared it anyway, figuring it would surely at least be edible.Well, it was edible. It was pretty salty, but I could live with that. It was the texture I just couldn't take. This soup has the mouthfeel of a soup thickened with corn starch (surprise, surprise)--like egg drop soup at a chinese restaurant. Which is fine for egg drop soup, but I found it utterly impossible to reconcile with my conception of split pea soup. Any peas were few and far between, floating in the viscous starchy liquid alongside a few sad rehydrated carrots. Just... gross. I finished one bowl and dumped the rest down the garbage disposal."
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"I have been using this product since I was a kid, as my mom used it before me. She is a hairstylist, I am an electrician, but regardless of occupation, I can't imagine a time, (on appropriately sized wounds), that this product isn't perfect.Does it sting? Yessir it does. I use it on wounds that are probably supposed to be to big for it, so believe me, I have dealt with some stinging. However, as some other reviewers have said, not only does the stinging subside relatively quick, but with it goes the original pain.Does it stink? Eh, I guess, but when a product works, it's forgiven. Meet someone who is not the most attractive person in the world and then fall in love with them, it might not make them a beauty queen, but they look better all the time to you.Simply put, this product, when used correctly, works. my recommendations are as follows.1. Put this product on as you are watching your evening TV. This will accomplish three things, one, it allows you to apply and let dry without thinking about it, two, while you're sleeping, it seems to setup extra strong. It will not just rub off throughout the night, and with no hand washing or anything going on, it really has a chance to take. Finally, you at least have that first overnight period of healing under your belt, and you will often times be amazed at what that small amount of time can accomplish.2. Apply New Skin generously. As it settles it will thin out, but how thin do you need it to be? I apply two, sometimes three coats.Using these two tips, I have had wounds heal incredibly fast."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,5.0,"We also have tried Gevalia, Folgers, and other brands but always come back to the Don because it tastes so good with our own blend of freshly ground beans. Our coffee never tastes too strong, just the best cup of coffee in the morning."

health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I purchased these because the way I see it, instead of buying a 20 pill bottle or 50 pill bottle, I figured I may as well buy in bulk to save money and not have to worry about headache medication for a long time. 5 Stars."

grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,"I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"I don't know if I'm qualified to judge this product. All I know is it did not work the way for me I thought it would. I had been told that as you age, you stop producing HCl for digestion. I thought if I took this product it would help with stomach health. It didn't. I actually had more stomach distress. I'm not sure if it was caused by the product. It just didn't work for me."

baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,5.0,"Bottles go from fridge to warm very quickly. This was fantastic for my husband who was frustrated when the baby went from mildly upset to all out whaling while he was trying to warm a bottle, this helps him a lot. Only word of caution is some times it makes it too warm so check your bottles during the heating time."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,"The Cara Water Bottle Combination is the only product of this kind that I have seen (and I have been looking all over) that isn't made of stinky, toxic smelling plastic that makes you wonder what is mixing with the water going into your vital places. Although it is smaller than I would like, one can still refill and continue on. Everything works well and is easy to clean, so you can get on with your day feeling just great."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I'd ordered Now Foods Spirulina before...it came from Hawaii and smelled like the sea and tasted like it came from the sea.I'm very disappointed w/ this product. It tastes terrible, and smells an awful lot like cow poop. I know, because there's a cattle ranch across the road from where I live. I got the large size because I mix spirulina into my pets' foods as well as into my smoothies and breakfast cereal mixes.The dog and cats seemed to relish the spirulina I'd gotten previously. The cats wouldn't go near this new shipment of spirulina, and the dog who gulps everything I put in front of her, got diarrhea for three days after I mixed this spirulina into her regular food (Merricks BG Buffalo).To be fair, just in case it might have been the food (Merricks BG Buffalo) that had made my dog ill, I fed the dog the same food without this spirulina. She was fine...no horrid stinky farts and no diarrhea. I waited a week, fed her the same food (Merricks BG Buffalo) adding the spirulina again. Poor dog got diarrhea again.This spirulina comes from India, which explains a lot.What a bummer. I used to trust the NOW FOODS label. Now I know to be much more careful about ordering any of their products. I threw out the packing slip and box this spirulina came in, so I'm out the money.This was an expensive lesson."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Ever since they discontinued my favorite Kashi breakfast bars, I've been looking for a suitable substitute. Although I haven't found anything quite as complete and cost effective as what I was buying, these are a close second. I'm not a morning person and often don't leave time to eat breakfast. These have enough protein and fiber to satisfy me for several hours until lunch time (but might not for a large man) and I can't get too cranky about paying less than $1.50 for a meal (using subscribe&save). This flavor is tasty and there are several other flavors I can rotate to decrease boredom."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,2.0,"Doesnt taste good and I love ginger. I even grated some ginger to add to it and it didnt help the flavor. With that said, if you want to try it for cheap, ""Big Lots"" has it for less than $2 a box."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I was a little skeptical about trying this tea thinking that it probably wouldnt work but after eating some really junky food (the fiance is on prednisone and we have been eating absolute junk) amd seeing the scale soar up seven lbs fully knowing that i was really backed up and enemas not taking care of much i figured why not. I steeped for 10 minutes and was suprised that the taste wasnt too bad. Well... I havr issues going in the morning and i will not poo at work so nearly 19 hrs after drinking this.. I came home and sat down and in about 2 seconds something slid. Now i thought it would be not much because of the duration so when i checked... ""holy ****"" was what i said.i had gone More than ive ever gone in my life.even with the stomache flu! That being said the scale is showing im down at least 4 lbs... So this tea really worked for me"

All the lotions we tried would make things better for a few days, then all the rashes and sores under her arms, back of her legs, elbows, etc. would flare right back up. Prescription steroid cream seemed to actually make it worse. After a few days of Florasone on the worst rash patches, with regular lotion everywhere else to keep any new rashes from starting, it actually got better. At the moment, this, combined with Shikai Borage Dry Skin Children's lotion, seems to finally be keeping things under control. Some of that may be due to environment--summer vs winter, so well have to see how this treatment fares in winter. But for now, 2 thumbs way up."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,2.0,"I bought one of these as a meal replacement bar at work one day. The taste is like super thick card board. The chocolate and caramel themselves taste good but the internal portion, which I'm not really sure what its made from, tastes like taffy flavored with dirt. I was starving and could not bring myself to finish the last half. I guess in that respect, it saved me some calories so maybe it does work well as a diet product."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I wanted to wait awhile before writing a review for Pan Acid. I bought this because I was wanting an alternative to prescription medication for my cystic acne. After several months of use I have not had a single cyst anywhere on my back, chest or neck. I would like to point out that this is a preventative measure not a cure. The existing cyst took the regular time to heal. I would like to also add an added bonus effect that I was not aware of until recently. My eyelashes have doubled in length!! After some research I have found that this is a property of B vitamin complexes, this wasn't my goal at time of purchase but was pleasantly surprised when I noticed my longer lashes in the mirror. I take one pill a day at bed time and couldn't be happier with the results. If you have cystic acne problems and would like a natural and cheaper alternative to prescription medications seriously give this a try."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Great product. Hard to drink even with adding more water but good for health and i recommend everybody to use it atleast once in a week.
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This powder is a wonderful drying agent and has been a miracle cure for me whenever I have an itchy rash from insects, plants or unknown causes."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,sauces,5.0,"I first had this at a local Mexican restaurant and went crazy for it, even though I thought I might die of the heat. I am a huge, yet disciminating, fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now. I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store. My husband won't come near this stuff. It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it's so much I can't take it. Of course, with continued dosage I can do more over time. Our Publix and Kroger doesn't carry it so I have to go to the mercado/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz. version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz. bottles here on Amazon (fiendish, I know).The flavor is excellent, uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar. It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it. Also, the color is fabulous. I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green. Love it.My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch. The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,1.0,I am the only verified purchaser here so I would not believe the other reviews. This is crap and I wish I could send it back. Sorry to be so brutal but that is the way I feel.Bill Kelly
health personal care,health care,thermometers,5.0,The shape and build of the thermometer prevent it from being inserted to deep. The baby does not seem to be in any discomfort as we take the temperature. The reading is given quickly. It is easy to clean and store. This is a great product!
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"I started taking this (6.4.12) for rotator cuff pain which I've had for years, stemming from an adolescent injury. Recent weightlifting had severely aggravated it again, and ibuprofen day after day wasn't a viable option. I was skeptical for sure, but either placebo effect or not, my shoulder feels far better than it did a month ago. I've continued to lift in the meantime, making no real accommodation for my shoulder other than supplemental. I also take fish oil, which may contribute to the progress."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,5.0,"I use Swiss Kriss in combination with Organic India Bowelcare (first in the morning, second at dinner time), and together they produce results! No cramps, bad aftertaste or any other negative reaction so far (it has been 2 weeks since I began using it). Reliable product and great seller. Highly recommend."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,unknown,5.0,"So happy to see this on Subscribe and Save and finally at a better price than the big box store. My kids love to eat just this for their lunch. My husband and I eat it as a side. Really, really good taste. I appreciate that I can cook this rather quickly and my kids are very happy. I have one that loves Kraft mac n cheese, one that loves the Rice a Roni Rice (4 cheese version), and one that loves Velveeta Shells and Cheese and one that loves this Knorr Pasta Sides (Alfredo). So we rotate and they are all very happy. (I personally say yucko to the Kraft mac n cheese (powder) and the velveeta; I want it homemade from scratch!; but I really enjoy the Knorr Pasta Sides and the Rice A Roni rices.) I haven't found a flavor of either of these products that I don't like."
health personal care,health care,women s health,5.0,When our daughter arrived a month early I struggled to make enough milk to avoid supplementing with formula. This product was the third product I tried to increase my supply and it ended up being a lifesaver - my goal of successfully breastfeeding was easily met after I started MotherLove. I recommend it to anyone who struggles with adequate milk supply and wants to start or continue breastfeeding.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I knew when I tore open the package that I was going to like this tea...but little did I know that it was soon to become my all time favorite! The sweet orange aroma reminds me of my childhood...the tangy orange flavor of an orange popsicle, or an orange flavored baby aspirin (St Joseph's) or piece of orange taffy. This makes a wonderful substitute for a sweet dessert...a nice after-dinner treat with no guilt."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"This stuff is good because it's not chock full of artificial sweeteners. Tastes good, though the vanilla isn't my favorite type of vanilla. It's more of a .. carnation-y vanilla taste. It doesn't stir as well as the Natural Chocolate either, so you may as well just blend or shaker cup it. It's also disgusting in water, unlike the chocolate which is palatable in water.The great thing about it is that it's not too sweet, so I often can handle 2 scoops in one cup of milk. Yum!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,4.0,"First, I have never left a review because I just flat don't take the time. However, I read ALL the reviews. I have tried the other brands (Medela). When my Medela hand pump stopped working my husband ran to the store and bought the Avent hand pump. I thought...oh no.... BUT it was the best purchase. It hurt SOOOOOOO much less than the Medela pump I had. The cushions help....they really do. As a mother I am making a sacrifice to feed my child breast milk, and to be in pain just doesn't make sense. Those first days/months are hard. When it came to buying a breast pump I found this one on line for the money I could afford and the reviews were ok. I thought if the hand pump doesn't hurt and these are the bottles I am using anyway I went for it. I am VERY Glad I did. It works like a charm. I would give it 5 stars, but I the first pump I had started to make noise and then stopped working after 3 months. With the 2 yr warrently they are over night shipping a new one to my house. Great customer service! So even though I am having a few days of hand pumping it is worth having the most comfortable pump out there. So if you are like me and trying to make a decision to ""follow"" the crowd or take a chance. Take it from me. Take the chance. Your breasts will thank you and your son/daughter will to because you will not be in pain.Good Luck to all the moms trying breast feeding.FYI- Don't purchase an electric pump until after your baby is here and you make that long term sacrifice. Buy the Avent hand pump and you will be fine for a few weeks/months (I went with a hand pump for 2 months). Then when you have made the decision to keep breast feeding, but THIS pump."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm very aware of my health. I have Rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure and cholesterol problems. I hate taking medicines and so I try very hard to eat healthy, exercise and do what my Doctor says. After reading a wide variety of web reviews I bought the 15 package box of Green Vibrance By Vibrant Health. The taste is well - awful! But than I guess what do you expect with something that's all natural and healthy. I followed my 15 pack box with the big 60 day supple, again all from here on Amazon. I figured I'd give it a chance and for those who hate the taste I'd say ""cowboy up"" and be an adult about it. For me the solution is to mix with Low Sodium V8 and add a few shots of Tabasco! It goes down pretty good than if you take a deep breath just chug it.I went to doctor for all my blood work on Monday of this week, I'd been taking it daily now for over a month. The numbers that came back were stunning! Everything is within the normal range! My doctor told me that what ever I'm doing, just keep doing it! I have more energy and I feel totally great! Yeah, tastes bad - learn to love it! Health is more important than taste in my life. I'm 64 years old and feel like I'm 20. This has my highest recommendation! I know we're all different and results for each of us will be different but I've found my elixir of youth! Even my wife has mentioned to me how much energy and spirt I have. I plan on buying this for the rest of my life which should be about 46 more years:)"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,I usually get orange and spice tea (not decaf)for hot tea and I was not sure about these flavors but I LOVE THEM and they are caffeine free! These will make great stocking stuffers for Christmas too! I'm going to have to order more soon!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"Stevia has been my favorite sweetener for many years and Sweet Leaf has the best quality and best selection from my experience. There is variety of flavors to choose from and even though the flavors are not overwhelming, they add a nice, subtle little undertone to the taste.I have always loved chocolate ice cream (Rocky Road for example) with raspberry sauce drizzled on top. One of the best combination of flavors on Earth!!Even though some people claim they do not like the taste of stevia, to me, the benefits of using it compared with the risks of white sugar or artificial sweeteners are well worth. It could also become an 'acquired taste'. A friend of mine started off hating even a hint of stevia in his tea... then became gradually accustomed to it after white sugar was banned by his health practitioner. For me, the taste was 'love at first sight'. Always loved it and always will.Key is to use only very little (drop or two) and then add more as needed.Not necessarily the best thing for baking, however for sweetening any beverages or smoothies, or even making your own healthy delicious chocolate truffles, this has been my number one choice!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Most L Carnitine products are tablet form which dissolve after absorbing moisture and become unusable . This is the only exception that I know of . Be sure to only order this supplement in the capsule form.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I ordered GeroVital GH3 after having it recommended by a colleague. I always take things skeptically until proven different, and in less than a month have noticed a decided impact. At first I began noticing being much sleepier (one way in which the body heals), and as that passed noticed an increase in energy. Shortly after this I noticed a loss of fatty tissue, and more lean muscle mass. On top of that an overall sense of well-being !! I asked my private Dr. about the supplement, and he said that this supplement has some anti-depressent qualities. While not being clinically depressed or anything it still made me feel less stress, and more at ease with myself ! The cost isn't much, and in my opinion is well worth the small amount it costs. For less than $20.00 it has changed me MUCH more than the years of taking Centrum, or One A Day vitamins !! Give it a shot, and if you're anything like me you will definitely NOT regret it. I saw a bad review above, but some people can't be pleased. If I had known about this product when I was 40 I would've began using it then, because as they say ""A ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" !!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"The only effect I had is to use the bathroom more with some bad feeling in my stomach with no effect on my weight,"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Although I was anxious to receive it it came is a reasonable amount of time. I use this in my moisturizing spritz mixture. I so love it and will be buying more of it.
health personal care,health care,incontinence,1.0,I cannot tell if this product is any good because the size on the package was way too small for actual fit. I wish I had known because now I have a case of something that cannot be used.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,I have tried enzymes from other companies and none compare to this one. I will definitely be using Source Naturals for a long time.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"One must know that this dieter's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along. Be careful at first, or it will be unpleasant!"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,cookies,5.0,"Some of the crackers were broken, but not too badly. The crackers themselves have a salty sweet balance that is wonderful! I love this product, super delicious."
health personal care,health care,incontinence,5.0,"I am completely satisfied with my purchase. It was fast and easy. The shipping was super fast. These wipes are superb. They are big, unscented and leave your skin soft, and clean. These wipes do not leave your skin sticky at all."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,coffee,4.0,"I got a good deal on this from the Amazon warehouse, so I jumped on it. I'm not at all disappointed. While it's not the best coffee in the world, it's what I consider to be a very good dark roast. I would compare it favorably to Starbuck's dark roast, but maybe not quite as bold.I'm not much of a coffee snob, so I can't really give much more of an in-dept review, aside from it's a good dark roast."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"These are tasty, and I like that they added sodium for my long runs/rides. This price is right, as well.I like the Bloks (they are like gummies) better than the gels, as the gels tend to make me gag when I am working out."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,3.0,"Americolor works great. Unfortunately it's taking more than 2 weeks to get to my house...after my twins 2nd birthday party. I had to drive across town to buy another set of these colors to do my kids birthday cakes. Oh well. I ordered on July 1st. It's July 16th, and they still haven't arrived yet. Also, the local shop sold the .75 oz bottles for $1.95."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I'm 13 weeks pregnant with my second child and just started taking Floradix about a week ago. During my first pregnancy my iron was low and my doctor told me to take extra iron pills. They helped some, but also hurt my stomach and caused slight constipation. For this pregnancy I am seeing a midwife and she gave me a sample of Floradix. Again my iron has been low and I've been very very tired. Feeling like I didn't have the energy to take care of my son or do anything else in life was really making me depressed. I was very cranky and my poor husband took the brunt of it. Plus, I am going back to work part time and was worried about how on earth I'd find the energy for that. I took the sample in the late afternoon and at 10pm that night I was wide awake feeling better than I had even before my pregnancy. Although I had plenty of energy, I did not feel like I was jittery or hyper like caffeine can make you feel. I woke up in my morning actually feeling rested...don't know how long it's been since that happened. I went out that day and bought a bottle. It's expensive, but so worth it. Sometimes I only take one dose so that the bottle will last longer and I still feel better than I have in a long, long time."
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"We've been using this machine for my son who is almost two since he was born. We don't really use the nature sounds other than white noise which I think is the waterfall and the rain setting isn't bad either. My main complaint with this machine is that the volume knob quit working properly pretty early on. You turn the power on with the voulume knob so you cant just set the volume to where you use it, you have to adjust it every time. This wouldn't be a big deal, but once it started having issues it became a real pain. I would turn it on and as soon as I'd remove my hand from the knob the sound would shut off. I would have to ""Fonzy"" it over and over and twist and turn the knob to finally get it to work. Then sometimes I could hear the sound through the baby monitor suddenly shut off, then turn back on again randomly which at times has woken my son. I have tried a few other machines trying to replace this one but I can't find one with white noise as good as this one. So I think I'm just going to buy the same one over again and hope we have better luck this time. We have a love hate relationship with this machine."
health personal care,health care,massage relaxation,5.0,This product gives you that Shiatsu feel. One of the things I like best about it is that your fingers don't get tired. You use the palm of your hand. It's best if you have someone use it on you. Another reviewer noted that it was flimsy. This is definitely not as sturdy as the dark blue one that I bought several year's ago.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"This product says *more than once* on the ad that it is HAWAIIAN. It is NOT Hawaiian. When my product arrived, I opened the jar and it smelled like - literally, SH*T. It was disgusting. When I added water, I swear it was like smelling the raw sewage in an outhouse, close up. I was gagging when I tried to taste it. When I tasted it, it tasted like how I would imagine raw sewage would taste like. The taste lingered for quite some time and don't get me started on what my burps tasted like. It is completely and totally disgusting. I contacted ""Now"" foods and told them their product was horrible and asked if they get it from Hawaii. They said no, they now get it from someplace in India. Where from India? Their sewage pipes?? I'm getting a refund now but what a pain in the butt. And what a TASTE of a butt. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP - and to me, that's literally what it is.... CRAP. Sorry so crass, but I call it like I see it.

The last shipment I received (two boxes) the package sizes had decreased from 2 oz to 1.75 for the peanuts and 1.5 for the cashews.I realize this is from Planters and it's a sign of the times but the product description needs to be updated.We like these at work but just like Granola bars, the price stays the same (or goes up) and the product size goes down.The product itself is fine but I am sick of getting ripped off by changes in product portions.Planters-Nuts On the Go Snack Packs, 24/2 oz Variety Packs"
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,So easy to make popcorn with these everything-in-on portion packs. All you do is load your popcorn machine with the premeasured amount of popcorn & flavored oil and you are good to go. Couldn't be any easier & tastes great too!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,Fatigue to Fantastic is right. I went from chronic fatigue to entering life normal in less than a week. I know of 4 other people that have had the same results. It was recommended to my by a Naturalpath and I now recommend it.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,i'm confident that this product does its job supplying magnesium.i'm not a person sensitive to bad medicine taste. but the taste of this takes it to a new level. it is simply awful. even when mixed with juices it is still very bad.won't buy again
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,We were buying the Wabash Valley kits at Bed Bath and Beyond but they get pricey. We saw this oil and decided to try it with generic popcorn and some popcorn salt. This works great! We use about 2 tablespoons of the oil with 1/2 cup of popcorn and about 1/4 teaspoon of popcorn salt. Makes a good kettle of corn in the Whirley-pop.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,"Celery Seed is recommended for gout attacks, as such I thought I'd start taking it proactivelyUnfortunately the day I took it I had not had much to drink that morning and this dieuretic is so powerfull that I had major kidney pains through the day until I started drinking far more water than I usually take in.Needless to say I don't take it daily anymore, but I will keep it on hand for whenever I need to ""flush"" my system during a gout flare up (just make sure to drink more than ample water!)"
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,"I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years. There is no subsitute. Many women in my family use it as well. This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation. I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive. I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :) I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing! LOL"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,The most this did was make my urine yellow and smelly. My hair did not grow. And these tablets are a task to swallow.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,I purchased these after having tried also the Met-Rx Big 100 Super Cookie Crunch. The Cookie Crunch was fantastic so I figured I would definitely give the cookie dough a go and it just isn't as good. Is still very edible but not nearly as enjoyable as the Cookie Crunch.
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,This is just what I was looking for. Our local movie theatre used to use coconut oil but switched to a different oil and the popcorn is just not the same. It takes very little (1-3 tablespoons) oil to pop a large batch of popcorn. Comes out light and delicious every time.
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,4.0,I have a serious green tea addiction and I'm always looking to explore different flavour profiles and various additions to the wonder that is green tea; this didn't disappoint. The brown rice comes through with it's nutty flavour but doesn't overpower the green tea. My only concern is that it will oversteep and get bitter pretty easily and anything over about 2 minutes is too much as opposed to other brands I've tried and it only deepens the tea strength. Otherwise it's a great start to my mornings!
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,5.0,"I bought this popcorn flavoring for my husbands birthday when I purchased him a popper as well, and he couldn't be happier with this flavoring! The flavoring is very nice, not to strong, and not to weak. I sprinkly it on as the popcorn is being popped. For a small container it last pretty long as well. We dump alot on to our popcorn and one container last us about a month of eating popcorn almost every night. I love the nacho cheddar flavor so much I'm going to try another flavor next time. Super happy with my purchase."
grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,5.0,This is simply the best tea that I have ever found. The flavors are incredible when combined with sweetener and half and half. Amazon offers this tea at a great price and shipping to my door so I don't have to take a chance on finding it at the store. If you are looking for a fabulous tasting tea...look no further! It's here!
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,4.0,"Very fine powdered chocolate whey. Tastes good enough but not enough chocolate flavor for me. Used this in the morning after my work out and mixed it in a blender. Mixed protein, 2 ice cubes, and a shot of milk and blend until smooth. This product had no chunks after blending and mixed nicely in a shaker."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I used this product years ago and it worked nicely so I thought I would try it again. This time around was a disappointment, wasn't like it was before. I don't know if they changed the formula or what but it doesn't do much at all."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,chips,3.0,"Terra Chips really mess up Taro Chips. Actually all of their chips are usually over baked and burnt, broken up, and unevenly seasoned, bordering on bland. Do yourself a favor and try Hawaiichips.com! I just had my first serving of their taro chips. They are light, thinly sliced, evenly seasoned, and absolutely excellent! Not one burnt chip in the bag. Head and shoulders above Terra. What's more they come from Hawaii and are still cheaper than Terra. I promise you I am not affiliated with the company... just a staunch taro lover completely sick of trying to get Terra to care about their products and their customers!"

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"My husband and I both take this everyday. I usually only take one capsule, not the recommended dose. If I am sick I will take up to four a day with meals. I love this vitamin because it doesn't upset my tummy and it contains so much more than just the basic vitamins and minerals. Such as choline, grape seed extract, MSM, green tea extract, coenzyme Q10, Ginko, Lycopene, and Lutein to name a few. I prefer the capsules over the tablets for easier absorption and digestion."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,4.0,This crispbread is nice and thin - great for those with more sensitive teeth.I eat 3 of these in the morning for breakfast with Smuckers Sugar-Free jelly on them.Guilt free and delicious.You do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter.If you press too hard they can break.One thing you can't tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air-tight packs in the box.I'm currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbread.Highly recommend both.Note

health personal care,health care,therapeutic skin care,5.0,"I've been using Black opal Dual complex face get for years and nothing works better. I have very acne prone skin and I will admit that I tend to pick at bumps when the appear, which leads to dark spots ofcourse. This stuff really helps clear it up. Not only does it help with dark spots, it minimizes pores. I use it in the daytime also, applying it after I wash my face(with proactiv), and before I apply my make up. I've tried Retin A before and while it is effective, it is really really pricey and can be very drying (even the low dose). This stuff is perfect."
health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,1.0,"It is a fact that ""most smokers"" that quit have done so only after multiple attempts. So this device should work as many times as necessary. But no - the marketing strategy is ingenious but very insidious. You get ONE ATTEMPT ONLY to quit. Then the device self destructs. No one can ever ""try again"" if they fail. No one can sell this device after they quit. That is why there are no Used Units for Sale on Amazon.The Seller is taking advantage of people in danger of dying and giving them just ONE CHANCE for life so that he can make more money.What is wrong with this Picture ? It makes me want to create a competing device that can be re-used as many times as necessary, so that more people will quit . . . more lives will be saved . . . and people can resell their device Used when they are done with it.The ""one use then self-destruct"" strategy to make more money is sickening and the Ad does NOT REVEAL THAT INFO !!!!!"
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,4.0,This product arrived as advertised. Grips are comfortable and tools are easy to use. Nice for casual use. I use this a few times a week and it's amazing what your toothbrush can miss.
baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,4.0,"When we left the hospital, they gave us some bottles and slow flow nipples that were supposed to be good for mimicking breast feeding. The baby took them fine, but she was extremely gassy and had a tendency to spit up a lot. I was happy that I had these around; I didn't plan on needing a lot of bottles because I was going to nurse. (A baby sometimes has other ideas...) These bottles specifically touted being good for breast milk, so we thought we would give them a try. There was a noted decrease in gas and spit up immediately, so we were thrilled about that.The only issue I had with the drop-in style bottle is the size of the inserts. The smallest size they have was 4oz. This will work fine for us in a few weeks, but when we first took the baby home, she was eating less than two ounces. The frustration with these bottles when the baby is eating so little is having to ""plunge"" the air out of them. When you are only putting an oz of milk into a 4oz bag, most of the milk gets caught up in the squeezed and plunged part of the bag! One last night, around 2am, we had a hungry baby and were trying to prepare the bottle. We were using a small tube-shaped container to plunge the bottle. I accidentally plunged too far into the bottle and couldn't get the plunger out. Needless to say, that bottle was not salvageable. In the light of 2am with a crying, hungry baby and now the need to heat up more milk, These bottles didn't make me too happy. So, we have retired them for now. We will start to use them again when she gets a little older and is closer to drinking 4oz.Overall, I am still happy with these, regardless of the morning fiasco. It was, after all, more an issue of user error than a defect with the bottle."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,it helps with muscle soreness and i really do see a difference when using it. It tastes like complete shit if you dont mix it with something besides water......but its bare-able though but i just prefer it in my shake or powerade.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,Hard to say if this works or not since I haven't had any blood work but easy to swallow and definitely doesnt make me immediately nauseous like some other iron supplements so that's good.
baby products,feeding,solid feeding,4.0,"The placemat is useful for trying to contain the mess involved during mealtimes with our 8 month old. It means you can roll up all the bits and rinse them out, rather than spending ages wiping the table clean. The crumb tray is helpful but doesn't contain it all, as it flops downwards and deposits bits into the child's lap. Anyway, there're no perfect solution but this is a helpful tool."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,It tastes great. A lot of nutritiens from a single capsule. And there're no side effects after taking two bottles. I'll continue to buy this.
health personal care,health care,foot care,4.0,"I was not really sure what I was getting when I purchased so I ordered two. As it turns out, they in fact come with two cups per order. Makes sense now, but did not seem obvious at the time. In any case, they have really helped with my sore achilles. They appear to be quite sturdy. I have used them for about a month. One pair in daily shoes and the other pair is used in various workout shoes."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,2.0,"This was a good product when I bought it from Amazon in the past. But this last one I got, in July 2012, is different. It now mixes very poorly, and has many gross jelly-powder chunks that will not mix no matter how much you shake. Maybe I just got a bad batch, and I'll probably give it one more try in the future. If I do discover that this was simply a bad batch, I'll then review it again more favorably. Too expensive to throw out, so I guess I'll be choking it down until it's gone."
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,4.0,"I am always looking for foods that have not been altered in any way. I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper. They all popped completely, and perfectly with this organic brand.I also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison. As far as popping completely, this brand won. The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method. There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand. There were none with this organic brand. The size of the popcorn were both equal, but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand, yet they didn't seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other. Flavor was good, but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it. The texture was different from the store bought version as well. It was less ""light"" and a bit more chewy in texture. Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version, or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcorn.I will be purchasing more of this brand. I was somewhat concerned about the packaging, but relieved to find that it comes with its' own ziplock sealer, so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh. Hope this is useful in helping you decide to purchase. Enjoy!"
baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,5.0,"I wanted to point out a couple things I didn't realize about the Kensington print in particular for others who are ordering and picking a color/print. First, it is much lighter than some of the other options which really helps when you're nursing and it's hot outside- my friends who have the solid color ones say that their babies are much warmer (it gets a little warmer under there, obviously, with less air flow) and seem uncomfortable compared to my little guy who seems relatively cool and happy. Second, and this is the main thing, my baby loves seeing the print on the underside of the cover while he's nursing! He loves the contrast between the light background and the blue and green vines which are visible even from the underside. Added bonus! Finally, I've gotten several compliments on the pattern- one woman even stopped me and asked where she could get the material because she liked it so much she wanted to make a dress out of it!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"I thought I was buying fiber tabs and found a long list of ""Other Ingredients"" (which I've copied below) in this product.

grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,2.0,I ordered these based on the positive reviews on amazon as well as I had been satisfied by other products by Kay's naturals. I found the cheddar cheese taste to be ok but the problem was that over 50% of the crackers in the bag have been crunched and it makes it difficult to eat. I canceled my subscription to the crackers. The box arrived intact and well packaged but the inside items were still crushed.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,This is my second order of this product. I like Nature's Way products and they're hard to find in my area. I won't be without B-100 Complex; have taken for years and it helps keep my skin clear. Well packaged and arrived quickly. Will continue to order because price is good too.
health personal care,health care,alternative medicine,4.0,"I have tried a number of different machines, and returned all of them. I couldn't ever find one that got loud enough. I use it in my children's rooms to drowned out noise. The others that I tried had nice sounds and may have been more esthetically pleasing, but were VERY quiet. If you need a machine to drowned out noise, this is a great option! I now have one in both kids rooms (1 and 3), we even take it on vacation and camping (it can run on batteries, too). I recommend it to all of my friends who's kids have trouble sleeping."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,I bought this because a friend of mine lost 23 pounds and she said she felt great. I have lost almost 5 pounds since I started it a week ago. I don't feel hungry or crave snacks. I used to get low blood sugar shaking and that hasn't happened at all while using the Almased. They taste Ok. I add unsweetened coccoa banana or vanilla flavoring and splenda and they actually taste pretty good then. They are a little grainy but just blend it in a blender until they are smooth. Easiest weight loss program I have ever used. My husband even bought me a new blender for the shakes.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,4.0,"I try to avoid any non-essential ingredients, so I bought this Natural Calm in ""original.""The taste is fine. It's a relatively neutral chalky flavor and the fizz is good, but I now wish I had bought one of the flavored varieties.Update - I bought the Raspberry/Lemon; the flavor is tart and fake, but it's not bad considering that there's no sweetener and it's definitely better than ""original"" flavor."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,My wife tells me that this product does work for her. More than once she has stopped taking Theanine Serene and has reverted back to feeling anxious and depressed. The product keeps her steady and happy. I am grateful.
grocery gourmet food,snack food,popcorn,5.0,"I was a little leery having to buy a box with 12 bags of popcorn. LOL! But I wasn't disappointed. I have to watch the salt intake and this has just enough salt (for me) to taste good and not enough to drive my blood pressure up. So health wise for me it is great. It won't compare to movie theater popcorn; but IF you love popcorn this is far better than my ""hot air"" popped corn that I try to ""add"" a little salt to and the salt falls off in the bottom of the bowl. I will definitely keep this on hand. Makes a great filling snack for the calories.September 20, 2012...I am towards the end of my 12 pack box of Bearito's Popcorn. I wanted to add that each bag is a very nice size and provides quite a few snacks for me. I am still very pleased with my purchase. It is almost time to order some more. :-))) So in the long run of things this has been economical for me. Personally...I am a happy camper!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,received on time and just as described. happy with purchase. what else can I say? It went as planned. do it again
health personal care,health care,first aid,5.0,"This is a fantastic bug guard/spf. My son was getting bitten up all over during his soccer classes. Once I got this, he has not been getting as bitten up and though he's tanned already I always worry about him burning like I usually do. It helps with that as well so I'd say its 2 for 2!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"The taste is much better than I expected after reading some negative reviews. Like former President Bill Clinton, I became a vegan after having heart problems and learning how meat is destroying us and our environment. If you are still used to the rich, animal fat and salt laden taste of burgers and fast food, this stuff will taste pretty bland to you. The good news is, a meal of it that gives my body complete and organic nutrition for only about two bucks and it's faster than going for fast food. It really is the ultimate meal especially when you don't have time to go to the Farmer's market and get fresh organic fruits and veggies, prepare them and clean up.I train at a boxing gym and also ordered a battery powered mixer so I can slam some of this after a workout. The ingredient list is pretty impressive and full of expensive things that do the body good. They could have loaded it with sugar or aspartame to make it taste better, but then it would lose its health value. As a kid I thought a balanced meal was a burger in each hand, but now I have way less body fat and cholesterol, more endurance and am getting used to the taste of healthier things. Not only is this one of the greenest foods for the environment, but this has some serious green color, probably from the spirulina. I'm glad there's quite a bit in it, because it cost me about 15 bucks just for couple ounces at a health food store. While I have to say a chocolate shake would taste better, this stuff is cheap, fast and making me lean and mean. I'm undoing all the body fat I put on from fast food shakes."
health personal care,health care,pain relievers,5.0,"Gum issue had persisted about one year. Used about 2 drops of OregaDent on my toothbrush along with my regular toothpaste and brushed using normal routine. In just a matter of a very few days the redness and tenderness was gone. The OregaDent stopped the inflammation and left my mouth feeling fresh and ""awake""! I also use OregaDent, along with pure castor oil (has no odor), to rub on the skin of my face (jawbone) at night. Couple of drops of caster oil with a couple of drops of OregaDent...regular use...heals inflammation. OregaDent is a healer...Oil is the catalyst for exterior absorption. It smells great too...not offensive in the slightest way. Kind of takes away all those bad memories of castor oil when I was a kid! You understand, don't you? ha!"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I don't order this to ingest it. I order it because it turns out to be the best deer repellant I've ever used. I have roses in my garden, a favorite snack for the numerous local deer on our island. I've tried a number of commercial deer repellant sprays; I was always disappointed. First, because they invariably clogged the sprayer, second, because the solution always washed off with the next thunderstorm, and third, the deer ate the roses anyway.I had bought this Cod Liver oil to ingest, but found the taste was just too fishy for my family's ""we prefer beef to fish"" tastebuds, so it sat in the fridge for a while. Having run out of the this-doesn't-work deer spray, and not wanting to waste the oil, I put two and two together and thought, ""Gee, if my tastebuds find this repelling, perhaps the deer will have the same reaction!"" They did.We mix the spray so the solution is about 1 part cod liver oil and 4 parts water. You need to shake it up quite a bit as you walk around spraying, to keep it emulsified. We tend to mix small batches at a time - a Spraymaster 32-ounce hand spray bottle works fine and lasts a while.The sprayers do not get clogged; you can get a fine mist; the rain doesn't wash it off; the roses don't mind it one bit, as long as you give them just a fine mist; and it also seems to discourage the bugs who also feast on the roses. Our roses have never been more lush.At first, I thought it was a pretty high price to pay for deer repellant, but when you do the math, and especially considering that this actually lasts and doesn't have to be resprayed as often, the cod liver oil comes out looking pretty good. I tend to spray only as new growth appears, so that the tastiest bits of the rose bush continue to be covered."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,3.0,"I deviated from CytoSport Muscle Milk to try this egg protein by Optimum (Vanilla Custard flavor). It's simply OK. It doesn't taste bad at all, but would not be what I would consistently pick out given all the other options out there. It mixes well in either milk or water, no clumps - at least not with the hand mixer I use. It's also really good for those with Casein sensitivity, since there is none in it.My taste preference is not representative of everyone elses, so I would recommend you try this out for yourself and see if you like it. Again, it is a quality protein, mixes easily, but the taste, in my opinion, is not stellar - but not terrible either. Three Stars."
health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,1.0,"I got this product because I have gas problem.The product has instruction ""take two pill with first bite of food""I tried that and worked well.... but only few days.I was taking as it suggested (almost everyday) but from week 2, it does not work any more.I am still taking it to see the condition will get better or not.If gas problem become gone before I finish the entire bottle, I will change the review."

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"I ordered this for the first time last year around the holidays. I wanted to make Nigella Lawson's guinness gingerbread recipe but had no idea what muscavado sugar was. I was thrilled with this product and will order it again this year before the holidays begin. It was fabulous in the gingebread and in homemade wheat bread. I used the last bit of it in some sticky toffee pudding for Christmas Eve dessert, heaven! It is great in oatmeal and I did try it in cookies but didn't care for it as it made the cookies crispy vs. soft and chewy, the way I like them, but if you're a fan of crispy cookies, the flavor is great. Also, didn't care for it in my coffee as several other reviewers recommend. I read the 1 star reviews and they were given because the sugar hardened, my sugar was soft and fresh but does harden quickly once opened if not stored in an air tight container. I have one of those terra cotta clay pieces that help keep your brown sugar soft and it works quite well."

health personal care,health care,pill cases splitters,5.0,"I am not sure the differences in this one or the regular cutter but it sounded like this one was better so for a couple more dollars, I bought this one for my dad. He is having to take half/split pills right now for his back injuries so I got him this one. The price is very close to what you would pay if you went to the store so you cna get it from about either place, but I knew I was getting a good one if bought this one from looking at the reviews.This one is nice also because the door cover is not colored, being clear allows you to easily see that you have the pill centered for when you are ready to cut it in two."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,2.0,"Based on the reviews I read here I was looking forward to writing my own positive review, but I made two batches in accordance with the instructions on the bag and the flavor was mediocore at best. I did not care much for the rice in the chili either and talk about some serious flatulence! I'm just saying! I have made my chili homemade for a number of years so in all fairness perhaps I was expecting too much from a pre-mix 25 minute chili but even after 6 hours no big flavor imporvements. I won't be making another purchase. I'll give the remaining bags to someone in my neighborhood who wants or is willing to try this product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,4.0,"I heard that Himalayan Pink Sea Salt was spoken of highly so when I needed to buy some more salt I decided to try this. I have always used sea salt in a salt grinder. The main differences between regular sea salt and this product, I would say, are that this is a very finely ground product, and it seems to be the saltiest salt I have ever tried. I definitely have to be careful and not use a lot because a little goes a long way flavor wise. Also, even though it is a finely ground sea salt I still use it in my salt grinder and it works perfectly fine. Overall I would say that I do like this product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new to add a little more flavor to their food. Just remember, a little goes a long way!"

You still get that grainy solution when mixed but I truthfully can care less about that.

Taste like....nothing, I get those extra reps, no bloating, and all around good product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,"If you've ever had Cream of Wheat, that's about the closest thing this teff comes to. The texture is almost identical, both pre-cooked and after cooking. It's real easy to eat and nice to mix into other grains like oatmeal if you need to use it up. It smells wonderful when you're cooking it. If you cook it slowly on the stove like we do, it seems to take forever to thicken up and then all of a sudden - bam - it's thick and your done. Custard is like that, too. It changes fast, so stay closeby the stove.Will keep purchasing this one."

health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,2.0,I did not like the taste and consistency of this...reminded me of milk of magnesium. Too thick and leaves a bad taste...easier to take tablets rather than doctoring this...

No diarrhea or anything, but awful!I found out that I was getting a fever at least one of these times, but I thought it was just the flu. I stopped taking it *again* and the next time I tried it I got appendicitis and had to go through emergency surgery.I really believe this product caused the appendicitis - its not a balanced mixture of bacteria. It could make you really sick. I switched to Phillips colon health - and it works wonderfully for me (for much cheaper)."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,5.0,"I have to say, I am very impressed by Duocal! We started using it back in May for my 3 yr old's chronic weight issues - Failure to Thrive for 18 months. I was very conservative about only putting in a teaspoon for an 8 ounce container of Pediasure. But then I started reading the directions and found out you can do 1 spoonful for every 2-3 ounces, so ... guess who added more?! Yep! And at my son's last weigh-in, he was ON THE WEIGHT CHART! Not only was he ON THE WEIGHT CHART, but he was also TENTH PERCENTILE! Yes!!!Now, I am not claiming Duocal did it all. It's the whole shebang, everything, that caused the weight gain. (And by everything, we are literally doing everything to battle Failure to Thrive ...) But Duocal was a part of the team and was likely one of the tipping point factors to break through the glass ceiling of weight maintenance and move us onward to gaining weight. So I am impressed and loving this stuff.By the way, please do not use without a doctor or nutritionist advising so."

I will take one in the morning and I notice by that afternoon my vision is starting to clear up.I don't know if this is one that your body starts adjusting to so the effects taper off and that's why people say it doesn't work.

It's also less expensive than many other non-whey protein powders, but the taste is unbearable. It's very strong. I wish I got the unflavored kind. It's grainy, the vanilla-taste is weird, and it makes my smoothies taste bad, even if I just put 1tsp in a 16oz mix. When baking or coking with it, don't make it the primary ingredient like protein pancakes with no flour..unless you like the taste. I have to add other stuff to my mixes to hide the taste.

grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,5.0,I like most any honey but I usually like to find and eat honey that tastes distinctly different than the ubiquitous orange blossom stuff. This honey makes it very clear that you have something unique and delicious in your gob. This is also true for their Sourwood honey which I also highly recommend. Their is something about the Tupelo and Sourwood flowers that make extraordinary honeys. But they are also not for the faint of heart. These are really different. You've been warned!

I will definitely buy these again."

Although I wouldn't reccomend leaving it in the lighter adapter all day, because it will keep burning... all in all, I like this product."
grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,herbs,1.0,"Soooo disappointed, guess I should have read the reviews before I purchased this item. This is the type of pretzel salt used on hard pretzels sold at grocery and convenience stores, NOT SOFT PRETZEL SALT. The picture is incredibly misleading :/ VERY UNHAPPY"
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,No difference after taking the first pill or the last one in the bottle. If you need to lose weight see your doctor for a prescription and weight management.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,5.0,"I really like that this vitamin is certified organic, made from whole fruits and vegetables, and doesn't have any soy allergens. I have this on auto delivery from Amazon so I don't run out!"
health personal care,health care,cough cold,5.0,Our family has been using Umcka to stave off colds for about 6 months now and we are believers. At the first sign of a cold take Umcka 3 times a day until symptoms go away. Even if you still get the cold the symptoms will be far less severe than if you didn't take Umcka. Great stuff.
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,3.0,"Tasted okay, can't tell if it worked or not. Took it on an empty stomach once and it made me throw up for 3 hours. When I did some more research I found out that 2 of the ingredients are known for decreasing milk supply and one is absolutely off limits to nursing women. Wish I would have known that before I bought it. I wouldn't recommend it and probably won't be taking it again after my son weans."
health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,1.0,"Centrum Silver, Multivitamin/ Multimineral Supplement, 220-Count BottleOrdered a 220 ct. bottle. Got 2 - 110 ct. bottles instead. Not as advertised. The exp. date had been peeled off the label on back lower right corner. A white sticker covered the peeled area that said New and 220 ct. with a bar code and number. Likely an expired product but covered up. Deceit and illegal."
